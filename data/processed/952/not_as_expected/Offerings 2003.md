FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Offering Circular contains certain forward-looking statements with respect to the financial condition,
results of operations and business of Cable & Wireless.

Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about Cable & Wireless’ beliefs and
expectations, are forward-looking statements. Words such as ‘believes’, ‘anticipates’, ‘expects’, ‘intends’ and
‘plans’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, but are not the exclusive
means of identifying such statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and projections and,
therefore, undue reliance should not be placed on them. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date
they are made, and potential investors should not assume that they have been revised or updated in the light of
new information or future events.

Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Cable & Wireless cautions investors
that a number of factors could cause actual results to differ, in some instances materially, from those anticipated
or implied in any forward-looking statement. These factors include: (i) failure to improve the performance and
financial position of the Group successfully or to adapt as needed to changing market conditions could adversely
affect the Group’s business, results of operations and potential for growth; (ii) withdrawal from the US market
may require the expenditure of additional resources, including management time and capital resources; (iii)
transformation initiatives can lead to execution risk; (iv) Cable & Wireless’ business may be materially adversely
affected by changes in regulation and government policy in the countries in which it operates; (v) regulation of
internet service providers could adversely affect Cable & Wireless’ operations; (vi) the Group’s business may be
affected by a business downturn; (vii) generally unfavourable telecommunications market conditions may
adversely affect the Group’s financial condition and results of operations; (viii) fluctuations in currency exchange
rates may adversely affect the Group’s reported results; (ix) the Group may not have or be unable to obtain
sufficient insurance to cover all foreseeable risks; (x) the activities of the Group’s insurance subsidiary may result
in material claims; (xi) future cashflow fluctuations may affect the Group’s ability to fund working capital
requirements; (xii) cash generated overseas may not all be available for use by the Group; (xiii) changes in credit
ratings may impact the Group’s future access to cash funding; (xiv) volatility in the financial markets may require
the Group to provide further cash funding to its pension funds; (xv) dependency on a small number of personnel;
(xvi) class actions may adversely impact the Group’s financial condition; (xvii) failure to pay a dividend in the
future may adversely affect the Group’s share price; (xviii) the Group’s operations could suffer from adverse
effects of competition and price pressures on the demand for products and services; (xix) competitors of Cable &
Wireless may gain competitive advantage by successfully completing a restructuring or bankruptcy
reorganisation process; (xx) continued overcapacity and other factors could lead to lower prices for the
Group’s products and services; (xxi) Cable & Wireless depends on the ability to achieve cost-savings to respond
to industry and market conditions; (xxii) the Group may not be able to adapt adequately to technological changes
in communication and information technology; (xxiii) the Group’s results depend on the introduction of
appropriate new products and services as the industry undergoes rapid changes; (xxiv) exposure to other
telecommunications operators and the behaviour of other market participants may have a detrimental effect on
the Group’s operations; (xxv) catastrophic network failure may expose the Group to potential liability; (xxvi) the
Group may lose revenue if unlicensed operators are able to gain access to the Group’s network undetected;
(xxvii) the Group is reliant on third parties for certain activities under outsourcing contracts and failure of those
third parties to provide the contracted services may expose the Group to additional cost and liability; (xxviii) the
Group is dependent on a number of critical IT systems to be able to conduct its business and process financial
information; and (xxix) mobile communications devices may pose health risks.

Trends and factors that are expected to particularly affect Cable & Wireless’ results are discussed in more detail
elsewhere in this Offering Circular, including, without limitation, in ‘‘Description of Cable & Wireless’’ and
‘‘Operating and Financial Review’’.

Bondholders

Interest The Bonds will bear interest at the rate of 4.00 per cent. per annum,
payable semi-annually in equal instalments in arrear on
16th January and 16th July in each year.

Status of the Bonds The Bonds will constitute direct, unconditional and (subject to the
provisions of Condition 10) unsecured obligations of the Issuer and
(subject as aforesaid) will rank pari passu, without any preference
among themselves, with all other outstanding unsecured and
unsubordinated obligations of the Issuer, present and future, but in
the event of insolvency only to the extent permitted by applicable
laws relating to creditors’ rights.

Conversion Subject to the right of the Issuer to make a Cash Alternative
Election, each Bond shall entitle the holder (such right a
Conversion Right): (i) to convert the Conversion Amount of
such Bond into Ordinary Shares; and (ii) to have redeemed the
Cash Settled Amount of such Bond at the arithmetic average of the
Volume Weighted Average Prices of the Reference Shares for the
five dealing day period commencing on the date falling two
business days in London following the relevant Conversion Date.

Cash Settled Amount means, in respect of each £1,000 principal
amount of Bonds in respect of which Conversion Rights are
exercised, £336 (representing 231.724 Ordinary Shares at the initial


-----

Conversion Price), or such lesser amount pursuant to any notice
given by the Issuer as provided in Condition 5(a) provided that the
aggregate of the Cash Settled Amount and the Conversion Amount
in respect of each £1,000 principal amount of Bonds shall equal
£1,000.

2003 to the close of business (at the place where the relevant Bond
is deposited for conversion) on (i) the date falling six days prior to
the Final Maturity Date (both dates inclusive) or (ii) if the Bonds
are called for redemption prior to the Final Maturity Date, the sixth
day prior to the relevant date fixed for redemption. The number of
Ordinary Shares to be issued on conversion will be determined by
dividing the Conversion Amount of the relevant Bond by the

necessary) to the nearest whole number of Ordinary Shares. The
initial Conversion Price is £1.45 per Ordinary Share. The
Conversion Price is subject to adjustment as provided in
Condition 5(b), including in the case of a Capital Distribution
and, in the event of a change of control constituting a Relevant

and the Trustee, that it will, on exercise of Conversion Rights,
deliver a cash amount to the relevant Bondholder or, as the case
may be, the Trustee determined by reference to the market value of
the Ordinary Shares. See Condition 5(i).

credited as fully paid having, on the date hereof, a nominal value of
25p each and will rank pari passu in all respects with all fully paid
Ordinary Shares in issue on the relevant Conversion Date, save as
provided in Condition 5(l).

the dematerialised securities trading system operated by CRESTCo
Limited, known as CREST, unless the relevant Bondholder or, as
the case may be, the Trustee elects to hold such Ordinary Shares in
certificated registered form or, at the time of issue, the Ordinary
Shares are not a participating security in CREST.

Taxes; No Additional Amounts All payments by or on behalf of the Issuer in respect of the Bonds
and the Coupons shall be made without withholding or deduction
for any taxation unless such withholding or deduction is required
by law. The Bonds will not be redeemed for tax reasons and there
will be no additional amounts paid in the event of the imposition of

Principal Subsidiary to conduct the whole or substantially the
whole of its business is curtailed or as a result of which the ability
of the Issuer directly or indirectly to exercise its rights of
ownership or control of, or receive the benefits of its ownership
of shares in, a Principal Subsidiary in any respect which is material
(in the opinion of the Issuer) is curtailed or restricted), the Issuer

by the Issuer to further strengthen its balance sheet and increase its
financial flexibility.

INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS

Prior to making an investment decision, prospective purchasers of the Bonds should carefully consider the
investment considerations set out below in addition to the other information contained in this Offering Circular.

CONSIDERATIONS RELATING TO THE GROUP’S OPERATIONS

The Group’s financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected should any of
these risks arise. The risks described below are not the only risks facing the Group. Additional risks not currently
known to the Group or risks that the Group currently regards as immaterial could also have a material adverse
effect on the Group’s financial condition or results of operations.

Failure to improve the performance and financial position of the Group successfully or to adapt as needed to
changing market conditions could adversely affect the Group’s business, results of operations and potential for
growth.

In June 2003, Cable & Wireless announced that it would withdraw from the United States, take steps
radically to improve the unsatisfactory operating results in the United Kingdom and build upon its strong
positions in national telecommunications companies around the world. Cable & Wireless cannot assure investors
in the Bonds that it will be successful in implementing the strategy as currently planned, that the planned strategy
will prove to be successful in an otherwise difficult market or that the Group will achieve all of its strategic goals.
Failure in any of these regards could adversely affect the Group’s profitability and its strategic and competitive
positions.

In addition, as part of this strategy, Cable & Wireless is undertaking a reorganisation of its businesses to
improve its position in a rapidly changing market place. Cable & Wireless’ plans for the implementation of this
reorganisation are incomplete in many respects, and the success of the reorganisation will depend in part on
factors that are beyond the Group’s control. Delay in implementation of the reorganisation may lead to the
management not being able to concentrate on developing their businesses with certainty, or to pursue
opportunities in their respective marketplaces. It may lead to staff retention problems, or staff resistance, such as
industrial action or non-compliance with Group policies. Furthermore, as Cable & Wireless refines the plans for
its reorganisation, the Group may encounter significant obstacles that it has not yet anticipated and that prevent it
from fully implementing the reorganisation or fully achieving its strategic goals. As a result, the Group cannot
assure investors in the Bonds that the goals of its strategy or reorganisation plan will be fully achieved. Cable &
Wireless also cannot assure investors in the Bonds that completion of the reorganisation plan will result in the
success of its strategy.

Withdrawal from the US market may require the expenditure of additional resources, including management time
and capital resources.

In June 2003, Cable & Wireless announced its intention to withdraw from the US market. Cable & Wireless
is currently considering the options it will pursue in exiting this market, but has yet to identify a specific approach
that it intends to take. It is possible that these options may be subject to regulatory or other approval. Among the
approaches Cable & Wireless is currently considering is a sale of its businesses in the United States. Cable &
Wireless, however, may not be able to identify potential purchasers for all of the US businesses or complete any
sale of the US businesses in a timely manner, on a cost effective basis, at the optimum price, or at all. In addition,
Cable & Wireless is also considering a number of alternative options and, if Cable & Wireless cannot find a
suitable purchaser for its US businesses or if it determines that an alternative will be preferable, the Group may
choose to wind-down its US operations or exit this market through some other means. Any approach Cable &
Wireless takes is likely to require a considerable amount of management’s attention, may not ultimately be cash
generative and may in fact require that it incurs additional costs. It may also lead to customer rentention issues,
which in turn may affect the expected financial performance of the business detrimentally. As a result, the steps
Cable & Wireless may take to exit the US market could in the shorter term impact on operating profit and
liquidity while it incurs any necessary costs associated with exiting this market.

Transformation initiatives can lead to execution risk.

The Group has been in rapid transition in the past few years, acquiring, and disposing of, a number of
businesses, as well as implementing a number of reorganisation initiatives. In June 2003 Cable & Wireless
announced its intention, over time, to expand its investment in national telecommunications operations. This may
include acquiring further entities and businesses.


-----

The Group has in the past and expects in the future to dedicate significant resources to integrate any
businesses that it has or will acquire and to effect any rationalisation of its operations.

Implementation is complex, time-consuming and expensive and, without proper planning and execution,
could significantly disrupt the Group’s business. The challenges involved include:

s combining service and product offerings and preventing customers and distributors from deferring
purchasing decisions or switching to other suppliers due to uncertainty about the direction of our product
offerings and our willingness to support and service existing products, which could result in incurring
additional obligations in order to address customer uncertainty;

s demonstrating to customers and distributors that the transaction or organisational changes will not result in
adverse changes in service standards or business focus and helping customers conduct business easily;

s consolidating and rationalising corporate and subsidiary IT infrastructure, including implementing
information management and system processes that enable increased customer satisfaction, improved
productivity, lower costs, more direct sales and improved inventory management;

s consolidating administrative infrastructure, including IT systems, and maintaining adequate controls
throughout the integration;

s coordinating sales and marketing efforts to communicate the Group’s strategy effectively;

s preserving distribution, marketing or other important relationships and resolving potential conflicts that may
arise;

s minimising the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns;

s coordinating and combining operations, subsidiaries, relationships and facilities, which may be subject to
additional constraints imposed by local laws and regulations and also may result in contract terminations or
renegotiations and labour and tax law implications; and

s managing integration issues shortly after or pending the completion of other independent reorganisations.

Regulatory risk

Cable & Wireless’ business may be materially adversely affected by changes in regulation and government policy
in the countries in which it operates.

The Group operates in some highly regulated markets in which its flexibility to manage its business is
limited. Regulatory decisions and changes in the regulatory environment or in government policy may materially
adversely affect its business, particularly in those markets in which it is classified as a dominant carrier. In some
jurisdictions, the Group is currently required to offer competitors access to its networks, supply subscribers with
various telecommunications services at regulated rates or on regulated terms and/or contribute to universal
services funds. In other jurisdictions, the Group is itself dependent upon customer access, interconnection
services and leased lines supplied under regulated terms and conditions by local or national incumbent
telecommunications operators. Future regulation may impact the terms of interconnection agreements with other
network operators and other similar agreements; impose market-access barriers; set price caps or regulate prices
directly; impose limitations or investment obligations on construction of new facilities and impose other
restrictions on the scope of the Group’s operations. The number of regulatory measures may also significantly
increase, or become significantly more onerous as the jurisdictions in which the Group operates reform their
telecommunications and related laws. Complying with new or more onerous regulations and restrictions may be
costly for the Group, and may adversely impact the results of the Group’s operations and business condition.

The Group’s ability to provide telecommunications services depends in most countries on receiving and
maintaining government licences and authorisations. Failure to acquire and retain necessary regulatory approvals
could impair its results of operations. Furthermore, regulatory regimes in some countries in which the Group
operates are often less well established than in other countries where competition in the telecommunications
sector has been established for longer. As a result, its business in these countries, especially where it maintains a
large, dominant or exclusive market share, could be subject to unexpected political, economic or legal
developments that impact telecommunications regulations and lead to the Group being unable to acquire or retain
the regulatory approvals necessary to its business. Any such development could have a material adverse effect on
its results of operations either in that jurisdiction or in aggregate.


-----

Regulation of ISPs could adversely affect Cable & Wireless’ operations.

Governmental and regulatory agencies have yet to promulgate comprehensive regulations specific to
Internet Protocol (IP) networks. Therefore, the Group accepts that risks could exist arising from future changes to
the legal framework that could impose greater burdens on it (for example, increased costs or restrictions on the
ability to provide services). In addition, the Group’s ability to adapt to multiple national regulatory regimes may
be limited, and uncertainty regarding the regulations applicable to some services may prevent or delay its
expansion in certain markets.

If a jurisdiction in which the Group operates adopts measures which affect the regulation of the internet and/
or other aspects of the industry, it could experience both decreased demand for its products and increased costs of
selling such products. Changes in laws or regulations governing the internet, internet commerce and/or other
aspects of the industry could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business.

Economic risks

The Group’s business may be affected by a business downturn.

A significant percentage of the Group’s revenue is generated by providing business customers with
telecommunications, IP, voice, data, managed hosting services and content delivery.

A continued slowdown in capital spending by service providers and other customers may affect revenues
more than currently expected. Moreover, the existing economic and geopolitical uncertainties and their potential
impact on customer demand, has created uncertainty as to market demand. As a result, revenues and operating
results for a particular period can be difficult to predict. In addition, there can be no certainty as to the severity or
duration of the current industry adjustment and the downturn in the business environment. The Group’s revenues
and operating results have been and may continue to be materially and adversely affected by the continued
reductions in demand from its customers.

In addition, a business downturn, fear of terrorist attacks or the impact of SARS may reduce the number of
international tourists. This may depress local economies in some areas where the Group has businesses (for
example in the Caribbean and Macau) and consequently adversely impact the financial results of the Group’s
operations.

Generally unfavourable telecommunications market conditions may adversely affect the Group’s financial
condition and results of operations.

The telecommunications industry is currently facing unfavourable market conditions, including amongst
other factors, the decline in investment in the industry, decline in demand for certain telecommunications
products and services, pricing pressures and over-capacity. These conditions, amongst other factors have led to a
general decline in share prices for telecommunications companies, including Cable & Wireless. These market
conditions have precipitated bankruptcy and insolvency filings by several telecommunications companies. In
some cases the Group has outstanding debts with these companies and may not be able to collect all the debts
due.

Some telecommunications markets in which the Group operates are in very early stages of development. If
unfavourable market conditions prevent some or all of these markets from developing, or if they develop more
slowly than Cable & Wireless anticipates, then the Group’s results of operations could be materially adversely
affected.

Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect the Group’s reported results.

A significant percentage of Cable & Wireless’ 2002 and 2003 revenues were generated outside the United
Kingdom. Accordingly, the value of those investments and associated revenues will be affected by fluctuation of
the pound sterling against the currency in which the investments, financing and revenue is denominated, as
reflected in the Group’s pound sterling denominated financial statements. The Group carries out foreign exchange
hedging operations to manage its exposure in respect of material transactions. To the extent that this hedging
activity does not cover the exposure then the Group’s results of operations and financial condition may be
negatively impacted by currency exchange rate movements.

The Group may not have or may be unable to obtain sufficient insurance to cover all foreseeable risks.

As a result of restrictions in global insurance capacity following the events of 11th September, 2001,
insurers have imposed certain limitations on the availability of insurance. These limitations affect the ability of


-----

the Group to insure adequately against certain catastrophic risks in the manner previously undertaken. Whilst the
Group continues to purchase such insurance coverage as is prudent and is commercially available to it, in certain
circumstances a particularly severe loss may exceed the limits of available insurance. For example, it cannot fully
insure against the risk of a catastrophic hurricane destroying Group assets concentrated in multiple locations in
the Caribbean. If a severe loss were to be incurred, it could have a material adverse impact on the Group’s
business, results of operations and financial condition.

The activities of the Group’s insurance subsidiary may result in material claims.

Pender Insurance Limited (Pender) is the Cable & Wireless Group’s wholly owned insurance subsidiary. It
was established in the Isle of Man in 1990 to provide insurance to the Cable & Wireless Group and is regulated
by the Isle of Man Insurance and Pensions Authority. It provided cover for various types of potential claims
against or losses incurred by the Cable & Wireless Group. The cover included, for example, catastrophe cover,
property damage, business interruption, professional indemnity and directors’ and officers’ liability.

Pender is managed by an independent entity which carries on business providing management services to
insurers and directed by an independent board. It is also advised by other insurance and reinsurance brokers and
service providers in the placing of its cover. Some of its operations were carried out by Cable & Wireless Group
personnel under contract to Pender.

During calendar year 1997, Pender began to write policies for other companies connected with the
telecommunications industry on a shared limits basis. Pender off-laid some of its exposure under these policies to
the insurance market by way of reinsurance. However, Pender retained some exposure itself. Notwithstanding the
reinsurance, Pender remains legally liable for all its policies.

As at 31st March, 2003, Pender had 43 policyholders, including Cable & Wireless. Cable & Wireless and
certain of the other policyholders established a mutual insurance company for new business from 1st April, 2003.
On the basis of advice from its insurance brokers, the Cable & Wireless Group decided itself to purchase
insurance from the mutual insurance company for the period commencing 1st April, 2003.

From 1st April, 2003, Pender began running off its old insurance claims and has not taken on any new
business for non-Cable & Wireless Group companies since then. Certain of Pender’s pre-existing policies with
third parties are still current.

The mutual insurance company provides some reinsurance for a number of these policies.

The adverse factors affecting the telecommunications industry, particularly as a result of US securities class
actions, have led recently to a significant increase in the seriousness of insurance claims against Pender, testing
policy terms and limits. Pender is resisting such insurance claims vigorously, in conjunction where appropriate
with its reinsurers, but, as certain of the insurance claims have not yet been fully quantified or substantiated by the
claimants, it is not currently practicable to estimate their financial effects.

In the event that Pender is unable to resist these insurance claims successfully and, in those cases where
reinsurance exists, its reinsurance cover were to prove inadequate, Pender may be subject to significant liabilities
which its assets may not be sufficient to meet. Moreover, there can be no assurance that these arrangements will
not have a material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Group.

Future cashflow fluctuations may affect the Group’s ability to fund working capital requirements.

The Group’s cashflows are expected to continue to be subject to fluctuations, depending on such factors as
timing and size of capital expenditure, cost of property disposals, levels of sales, timing of collection of
receivables and supplier terms and conditions. Cable & Wireless continues to have ongoing discussions with its
banks and other financial institutions to explore additional financing opportunities and credit and support
arrangements.

Cash generated overseas may not all be available for use by the Group.

Cable & Wireless currently is able to repatriate most of its surplus cash generated overseas but there is a risk
that governments could apply severe restrictions and this could result in the Group seeking further financing.

Changes in Credit Ratings may impact the Group’s future access to cash funding.

Cable & Wireless currently has a range of financing arrangements in place. Any change in Cable &
Wireless’ credit ratings could impact Cable & Wireless’ interest rates, ability to raise debt, access to the


-----

commercial paper market and ability to engage in alternative financing arrangements. Any inability to access
adequate financing at an acceptable cost could adversely impact the Group’s ability to implement its strategy.

Volatility in the financial markets may require the Group to provide further cash funding to its pension funds.

Cable & Wireless currently maintains various defined benefit plans which cover various categories of
employees and retirees. The Group’s obligations to make contributions to fund benefit obligations under these
plans are based on actuarial valuations, which themselves are based on certain assumptions about the long-term
operation of the plans, including employee turnover and retirement rates, the performance of the financial
markets and interest rates. If the actual operation of the plans differs from the assumptions, additional
contributions may be required. The equity markets can be, and recently have been, volatile, and therefore the
estimate of future contribution requirements can change significantly in a short period of time. Similarly, changes
in interest rates may also impact funding requirements. In a low interest rate environment, the likelihood of
required contributions in the future increases. If the Group is required to make significant contributions to fund
the defined benefit plans, the reported results could be materially and adversely affected and the cashflow
available for other uses may be significantly reduced.

Dependency on a small number of personnel.

A small number of key executive officers manage the businesses. In addition, the Group’s future success will
depend in a large part on its continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. The loss
of key personnel or an inability to attract personnel of suitable calibre could have a material adverse effect on the
business of Cable & Wireless.

Class Actions may adversely impact the Group’s financial condition.

A number of class actions have been filed against the Group in the United States alleging violations of
certain sections of the US Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. In March 2003, the Court consolidated these
cases into one action. Cable & Wireless believes it has meritorious defences to these claims and intends to defend
itself vigorously but, if the action is upheld by the US courts, it could adversely impact on the Group’s financial
condition.

In addition, Cable & Wireless is from time to time involved in other litigation, which if decided adversely to
the Group could, individually or in the aggregate, adversely impact its financial condition or reputation. Further
details of the class action litigation in the United States and other material legal proceedings are set out under
‘‘Description of Cable & Wireless – Legal Proceedings’’.

Failure to pay a dividend in the future may adversely affect the Group’s share price.

Cable & Wireless has announced that there will be no final dividend for 2003 and no interim dividend
declared for 2004. Failure to pay a dividend in the future may adversely affect the Group’s share price.

Competitive position risks – external competitive pressures

The Group’s operations could suffer from adverse effects of competition and price pressures on the demand for
products and services.

The Group faces competition and downward pressure on prices in many areas and markets of its business.
The Group’s competitors may be able to expand their network infrastructures and service offerings more quickly
than the Group. In addition, some competitors have entered and will likely continue to enter into joint ventures or
alliances to provide additional services against which the Group may be unable to compete. The Group also
believes the sector may experience consolidation in the near future, which could result, amongst other things, in
further competition that would make it more difficult for Cable & Wireless to compete effectively.

As the markets for some of the Group’s services expand in certain locations, additional competition may
emerge and existing competitors may commit more resources to the markets in which it participates. For
example, governments in various countries in which the Group provides telecommunications services, in some
cases on an exclusive basis and in others where it until recently provided services on an exclusive basis, have
begun liberalising the telecommunications industry by introducing regulated competitive markets for some
products and services in place of exclusive licences. The Group may lose market share to some of the competitors
entering the market as a result of this transformation and its operating results and revenues may be adversely
affected.


-----

Competitors of Cable & Wireless may gain competitive advantage by successfully completing a restructuring or
bankruptcy reorganisation process.

Certain of the Group’s competitors in the United States have filed for bankruptcy or Chapter 11 protection.
There is a possibility that such competitors will emerge from their restructuring with a significantly lower cost
base than Cable & Wireless and be able to compete more effectively than the Group. This could result in the
Group losing market share which could in turn negatively impact the Group’s financial condition and results of
operations.

In addition, given its own recent losses, the Group may lose customers to competitors if the customers have
significant concerns over the future financial strengths and strategy of the Group.

Continued overcapacity and other factors could lead to lower prices for the Group’s products and services.

The transatlantic, pan-European and US markets are all currently experiencing considerable levels of
overcapacity.

Overcapacity coupled with lower than expected levels of demand growth contributed to a severe price
decline in these markets. This in turn resulted in many network operators becoming financially distressed and
filing for bankruptcy or Chapter 11 protection. This could compel the Group to lower prices to prevent erosion of
its market share or to continue attracting new customers. If the Group is forced to lower its prices the financial
condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, if the Group is unable to sufficiently
reduce its costs, for example because it is obliged to honour existing contracts containing commercial terms
which are onerous in the context of current market conditions, this too may materially adversely affect the
Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, the Group may lose business to its competitors if they offer contract terms to customers which
the Group is unable to match.

If the current overcapacity situation is not resolved or worsens, prices may continue to decline in the affected
regions and such price decline could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s operations.

Competitive position risks – internal competitive pressures

Cable & Wireless depends on the ability to achieve cost-savings to respond to industry and market conditions.

The Group continues to restructure its business to realign resources and achieve desired cost savings. The
Group has based its restructuring efforts on certain assumptions regarding the cost structure of its business and
the nature, severity and duration of the industry downturn which may or may not be correct. The Group must be
able to successfully implement its work plan and refine, expand or extend it if necessary, if it is to reduce its cost
structure appropriately to respond to changing market conditions. The restructuring efforts may not be sufficient
to achieve profitability and meet the changes in industry and market conditions.

While restructuring, the Group has made, and will continue to make, judgements as to whether it should
further reduce its workforce or exit, or dispose of, certain businesses. These workforce reductions may impair its
ability to achieve its current or future business objectives.

Costs incurred in connection with restructuring efforts may be higher than estimated. Any decision by
management to further limit investment or exit, or dispose of, businesses may result in the recording of additional
charges or adversely impact the Group’s ability to meet its current or future business objectives. As a result, the
costs actually incurred in connection with the restructuring efforts may be higher than originally planned and may
not lead to the anticipated cost savings and a return to profitability.

Changes in future technology

The Group may not be able to adapt adequately to technological changes in communication and information
technology.

The telecommunications industry is subject to rapid and significant changes in technology. The development
of new technologies could render its current services obsolete and non-competitive and require the Group to
write-down the book values of investments it has made in existing technologies. The Group’s business plan
contemplates the introduction of services using new technologies and it may have to make substantial additional
investments in new technologies in order to remain competitive. New technologies that it chooses to acquire may
not prove to be successful, and the cost of implementation for emerging and future technologies could be
significant and constitute a negative return on the investment. In addition, Cable & Wireless may not receive the


-----

necessary licences to provide services based on new technologies in jurisdictions in which it operates. It may also
be forced to change its product and service offerings or pay higher costs if the third-party technology that it
employs changes or if the price of such technology increases. As a result, the Group could lose customers, fail to
attract new customers or incur substantial costs to maintain its customer base. Any such occurrence could have a
material adverse effect on the Group’s financial results.

The Group’s results depend on the introduction of appropriate new products and services as the industry
undergoes rapid changes.

All sectors in which Cable & Wireless operates are characterised by changing customer demand for new
products and services as new technologies become available.

If the new products and services that the Group develops and implements do not meet the demands of its
existing and target customers, then the Group may not be able to recover its costs in developing such new
products and services and it may lose market share. This could result in a material adverse effect on the Group’s
financial results.

Service delivery

Exposure to other telecommunications operators and the behaviour of other market participants may have a
detrimental effect on the Group’s operations.

The Group’s operations in some countries are dependent upon access to networks that it does not own or
entirely control, including networks controlled by current or former government-owned public
telecommunications operators. Cable & Wireless’ operations depend on these network operators to provide
interconnection services for the origination and/or termination of some of its telecommunications services.

The Group has experienced interconnection capacity shortages in the past, and it may do so again if it is
unable to obtain and maintain the necessary interconnection and other transmission services in a timely fashion
and on acceptable commercial terms in each country in which it intends to introduce or continue to offer its
telecommunications services. The Group may also be subject to the constraints, including financial constraints, of
the relevant network operator, which may be unable to provide any or all of the capacity that the Group requests.
If it cannot obtain the capacity it requires to adequately serve all of its existing customers or to connect all of its
potential new customers, the Group may lose them to its competitors. All of this could adversely affect the
Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

As part of the development of the Cable & Wireless network, some Group companies have acquired
Indefeasible Rights of Use (IRU’s) from a number of carriers including Global Crossing, Level 3, Qwest,
WorldCom and Flag Financial Corporation. An IRU gives the purchaser a guaranteed right to use the network
asset (cable, fibre or wavelength) over a contractual period. A number of the IRU providers have filed for Chapter
11 (or similar bankruptcy protection) or are in financial difficulty. The risk to the Group is that such a company
may not be obliged or may be unable to continue to honour its agreement to grant the exclusive right of use to the
Group (even if that grant is already effected) or to maintain the asset in which the IRU resides. If this occurs then
there can be no assurance that Cable & Wireless will be able to find alternative providers and that the provision of
network will be on the same terms as before. As a result, the business, financial condition or results of operations
of the Group may be adversely affected.

Catastrophic network failure may expose the Group to potential liability.

The Group’s network uses a collection of communications equipment, software, operating protocols and
proprietary applications for the high-speed transportation of large quantities of data between multiple locations.
The Group also operates national and international voice networks. Catastrophic network failure or a major
network interruption may occur as a result of natural disasters, a loss of a major element of the network, security
breaches, terrorist action or computer viruses. These failures or interruptions could cause delays or service
interruptions and could expose the Group to claims from customers or could require expensive repairs or
modifications, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business.

The Group may lose revenue if unlicensed operators are able to gain access to the Group’s network undetected.

In certain markets where the Group operates it suffers from revenue leakage where operators gain illegal
access to its network. The Group takes considerable action to identify and prevent such occurrences, but the level
of actions available to it may be limited by local regulation. To the extent that the Group’s efforts are not wholly
successful, it may lose revenue and the Group’s financial performance be adversely impacted.


-----

Other risks

The Group is reliant on third parties for certain activities under outsourcing contracts. Failure of those third
parties to provide the contracted services may expose the Group to additional cost and liability.

The Group has outsourced a number of support activities to third parties, including the provision of certain
IT services in the United Kingdom and United States. In the event that the outsourcing company fails to deliver
the contracted services, the Group may incur additional costs as it attempts to find an alternate supplier and its
financial results might be adversely impacted. On 6th June, 2003, the Group gave notice of termination under its
outsourcing contract with IBM (see ‘‘Description of Cable & Wireless – Legal Proceedings’’). In the event that
transferring the activities outsourced to IBM to an alternative supplier (or to the Group itself) is more difficult
than the Group anticipates it may incur additional costs and its financial results and operations might be adversely
impacted.

The Group is dependent on a number of critical IT systems to be able to conduct its business and process
financial information.

In carrying out its business, the Group is dependent on the availability and reliability of a number of IT
systems. In the event that any of these systems fail and disaster recovery and business continuity plans are
ineffective, the Group may be exposed to additional costs and liabilities. In addition, many of these IT systems,
such as billing, are legacy systems that operate on different platforms. The Group may be exposed to additional
costs and liabilities in endeavouring to upgrade or integrate systems and may sustain costs or liabilities as a result
of the inefficiencies posed by having multiple systems that in some instances cannot be readily reconciled.

Mobile communications devices may pose health risks.

Media reports have suggested that radio frequency emissions from mobile telephone handsets and
transmission facilities may pose various health risks, including cancer, and may interfere with various electronic
medical devices, including hearing aids and pacemakers. Research and studies into the health risks posed by
mobile telephone handsets and transmission facilities are ongoing. Cable & Wireless provides mobile services
principally in the Caribbean, Panama and Macau and also provides national and international network capacity to
mobile operators. Cable & Wireless continues to monitor scientific and medical research and studies, media,
legal, regulatory and other developments, as well as the public perception of risk arising from the use of mobile
telephone handsets. Scientific research on mobile telephone handsets and health has been reviewed by a number
of independent expert scientific panels. None of these panels has concluded that the use of mobile telephone
handsets is harmful to health.

Nonetheless, increased speculation regarding health risks associated with mobile telephone handsets and
transmission facilities or any subsequent substantiation of such risks could have a material adverse effect on the
Group’s business including through:

s a reduction in the number of actual and potential customers;

s reduced usage per customer;

s exposure to potential litigation or other liability;

s regulatory intervention and new legislation; or

s exposure to adverse publicity and damage to reputation.

CONSIDERATIONS RELATING TO THE BONDS

Bondholders have no shareholder rights before conversion

An investor in a Bond will not be a shareholder in the Issuer. No Bondholder will have any voting rights, any
right to receive dividends or other distributions or any other rights with respect to any Ordinary Shares until such
time, if any, as he or she converts his or her Bond and becomes registered as the holder thereof.

The Bonds may not have an active trading market

The Bonds have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and, unless so
registered, may not be offered or sold except in a transaction exempt from, or not subject to, the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. Although it is expected that the Bonds will
be admitted to the Official List of the UK Listing Authority and traded on the London Stock Exchange on or after
the Issue Date, there may be little or no secondary market for the Bonds. Even if a secondary market for the Bond


-----

develops, it may not provide significant liquidity and it is expected that transaction costs in any secondary market
may be high. As a result, the difference between bid and ask prices for the Bonds in any secondary market could
be substantial.

Volatility of the market for the Bonds and the Ordinary Shares

The market prices of the Ordinary Shares have been subject to volatility and fluctuations in the market price
of the Ordinary Shares may affect the market price of the Bonds. The market price of the Bonds and the Ordinary
Shares could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond the
control of the Issuer. These factors include, among other things, actual or anticipated variations in operating
results, earnings releases by the Group and its competitors, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts,
market conditions in the industry and the general state of the securities markets, governmental legislation or
regulation, currency and exchange rate fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions, such as
recessions.

No tax gross-up

The Issuer is not obliged to make any additional payments to Bondholders in the event that any amount is
required to be withheld or deducted for or on account of any present or future taxes or duties of whatever nature
from any payment made in respect of the Bonds. Neither the Issuer nor the Bondholders has any right to require
redemption of the Bonds in the event of such a withholding or deduction. See Condition 8.


-----

per annum calculated by reference to the principal amount thereof and payable semi-annually in equal
instalments in arrear on 16th January and 16th July in each year (each an Interest Payment Date), commencing
on 16th January, 2004. The amount of interest payable in respect of any period which is not an Interest Period


-----

shall be calculated on the basis of the number of days in the relevant period from (and including) the first day of
such period to (but excluding) the last day of such period divided by the number of days from (and including) the
immediately preceding Interest Payment Date (or, if none, the Closing Date) to (but excluding) the next Interest
Payment Date. Interest Period means the period beginning on (and including) the Closing Date and ending on
(but excluding) the first Interest Payment Date and each successive period beginning on (and including) an

payment of principal is improperly withheld or refused and in such event such Bond shall continue to bear
interest (both before and after judgment) as provided in the Trust Deed.

5. Conversion of Bonds into Ordinary Shares

(a) Conversion Period and Conversion Price

Subject to the right of the Issuer to make a Cash Alternative Election under Condition 5(i), each Bond shall
entitle the holder (such right a Conversion Right): (i) to convert the Conversion Amount (as at the relevant
Conversion Date) of such Bond into Ordinary Shares, credited as fully paid; and (ii) to have redeemed the Cash
Settled Amount (as at the relevant Conversion Date) of such Bond at the arithmetic average of the Volume
Weighted Average Prices of the Reference Shares for the five dealing day period commencing on the date falling
two business days in London following the relevant Conversion Date (the Redemption Price). A Bondholder
may exercise the Conversion Right in respect of a Bond by delivering such Bond to the specified office of any
Paying and Conversion Agent in accordance with Condition 5(j), subject to any Cash Alternative Election being
in effect, whereupon the Issuer shall issue to the Bondholder Ordinary Shares credited as paid up in full as
provided in this Condition 5 and shall pay the Redemption Price. Subject to, and upon compliance with, the
provisions of these Conditions, the Conversion Right in respect of a Bond may be exercised, at the option of the
holder thereof, at any time (subject to any applicable fiscal or other laws or regulations and as hereinafter
provided) from 26th August, 2003 to the close of business (at the place where the relevant Bond is delivered for
conversion) on the date falling six days prior to the Final Maturity Date (both days inclusive) or, if the Bonds
shall have been called for redemption pursuant to Condition 6(b) prior to the Final Maturity Date, then up to the
close of business (at the place aforesaid) on the sixth day before the date fixed for redemption thereof, unless
there shall be default in making payment in respect of such Bond on such date fixed for redemption, in which
event the Conversion Right shall extend (unless already exercised by the Trustee pursuant to Condition 5(k)) up
to the close of business (at the place aforesaid) on the date on which the full amount of such payment becomes
available for payment and notice of such availability has been duly given in accordance with Condition 17 or, if
earlier, the Final Maturity Date; provided that in each case if the final such date for the exercise of Conversion
Rights is not a business day at the place aforesaid then the period for exercise of the Conversion Right by
Bondholders shall end on the immediately preceding business day at the place aforesaid. The period during which
Conversion Rights may be exercised by a Bondholder is referred to as the Conversion Period. As used in these
Conditions with respect to any place, business day means a day (other than a Saturday or Sunday) on which
commercial banks are open for general business in such place.

A Conversion Right may not be exercised following the giving of notice by the Trustee pursuant to
Condition 9.

The Issuer may at any time and from time to time by notice to the Bondholders and the Trustee in
accordance with Condition 17, on and with effect from the date specified in such notice, not being earlier than the
date seven days after the date on which such notice is given, increase the Conversion Amount by an amount
specified in such notice and reduce the Cash Settled Amount by an equal amount.

The Redemption Price shall be paid not later than the Cash Payment Date by a pounds sterling cheque drawn
on, or by transfer to, a pounds sterling account maintained with a bank in London in accordance with instructions
contained in the relevant Conversion Notice or, in the case of the exercise of Conversion Rights by the Trustee, in
accordance with instructions given by the Trustee.

Conversion Rights may be exercised by the Trustee subject to, and during the period described in, Condition
5(k).


-----

The number of Ordinary Shares to be issued on exercise of a Conversion Right shall be determined by
dividing the Conversion Amount of the relevant Bond by the conversion price (the Conversion Price) in effect
on the relevant Conversion Date. Notwithstanding the above, if Conversion Rights are exercised in respect of the
Bonds in circumstances where the Conversion Price is determined as provided in Condition 5(b)(x), then the
relevant holder (or, as the case may be, the Trustee) will not be entitled to receive that number of Ordinary Shares
(the Excess Ordinary Shares) in excess of the number of Ordinary Shares it would be entitled to receive if the
Conversion Price had not been adjusted as provided in Condition 5(b)(x) and in lieu thereof shall be entitled to
receive the Cash Alternative Amount determined (i) as if a Cash Alternative Election had been made and not
revoked and was applicable to such exercise of Conversion Rights and (ii) as if ‘‘S’’ in the formula set out in the
definition of Cash Alternative Amount referred to the Excess Ordinary Shares (including, for this purpose, any
fraction of an Ordinary Share to which the relevant holder or, as the case may be, the Trustee would otherwise
have been entitled to receive). Such Cash Alternative Amount shall be payable as provided in Condition 5(i). The
initial Conversion Price is £1.45 per Ordinary Share. The Conversion Price is subject to adjustment in the
circumstances described in Condition 5(b).

Fractions of Ordinary Shares will not be issued on conversion and no cash payment will be made in lieu
thereof. However, if the Conversion Right in respect of more than one Bond is exercised at any one time such that
Ordinary Shares to be issued on conversion are to be registered in the same name, the number of such Ordinary
Shares to be issued in respect thereof shall be calculated on the basis of the Conversion Amount of the aggregate
principal amount of such Bonds being so converted. Where the Trustee shall have exercised Conversion Rights
pursuant to Condition 5(k), all relevant Bonds in respect of which Conversion Rights are exercised shall, for the
purpose of this paragraph, be deemed to be held by one person.

The Issuer will procure that Ordinary Shares to be issued on conversion will be issued to the holder of the
Bonds completing the relevant Conversion Notice or his nominee or, where Conversion Rights have been
exercised by the Trustee pursuant to Condition 5(k), the Trustee on behalf of the relevant Bondholders or any
person nominated by it. Such Ordinary Shares will be deemed to be issued as of the relevant Conversion Date.

(b) Adjustment of Conversion Price

Upon the happening of any of the events described below, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted as follows:

(i) If and whenever there shall be an alteration to the nominal value of the Ordinary Shares as a result of
consolidation or subdivision, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion
Price in force immediately prior to such alteration by the following fraction:

A

B

where:

A is the nominal amount of one Ordinary Share immediately after such alteration; and

B is the nominal amount of one Ordinary Share immediately before such alteration.

Such adjustment shall become effective on the date the alteration takes effect.

(ii) If and whenever the Issuer shall issue any Ordinary Shares credited as fully paid to the holders of
Ordinary Shares (the Shareholders) by way of capitalisation of profits or reserves (including any share
premium account or capital redemption reserve) other than any such Ordinary Shares issued instead of
the whole or part of a cash dividend which the Shareholders concerned would or could otherwise have
received, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price in force
immediately prior to such issue by the following fraction:

A

B

where:

A is the aggregate nominal amount of the issued Ordinary Shares immediately before such issue; and

B is the aggregate nominal amount of the issued Ordinary Shares immediately after such issue.

Such adjustment shall become effective on the date of issue of such Ordinary Shares.


-----

(iii) If and whenever the Issuer shall pay or make any Capital Distribution (as defined below) to the
Shareholders, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price in force
immediately prior to such Capital Distribution by the following fraction:

A – B

A

where:

A is the Current Market Price (as defined below) of one Ordinary Share on the dealing day
immediately preceding the date on which the Ordinary Shares are traded on the London Stock
Exchange ex- the relevant Capital Distribution; and

B is the portion of the Fair Market Value (as defined below) (as determined as at the date of
announcement of the relevant Dividend) of the Capital Distribution attributable to one Ordinary
Share.

Such adjustment shall become effective on the date on which such Capital Distribution is made.

As used in this Condition 5(b):

Capital Distribution means:

(a) any Dividend which is expressed by the Issuer or declared by the Board of Directors of the Issuer
to be a capital distribution, extraordinary dividend, extraordinary distribution, special dividend,
special distribution or return of value to shareholders of the Issuer or any analogous or similar
term, in which case the Capital Distribution shall be the Fair Market Value of such Dividend; or

(b) any Dividend which, when taken together with all other Dividends (other than any Dividend or
portion thereof deemed to be a Capital Distribution) made in respect of the same fiscal year as such
Dividend, exceeds 5 per cent. of the Fair Market Value of an Ordinary Share on the date
immediately preceding the announcement of such Dividend multiplied by the number of Ordinary
Shares in issue on such date. In such case, the Capital Distribution shall be the amount by which
such Dividend, when taken together with all other Dividends as aforesaid, exceeds 5 per cent. of
the Fair Market Value of an Ordinary Share multiplied by the number of Ordinary Shares in issue
as aforesaid.

In making any such calculation, such adjustments (if any) shall be made as an Independent Financial
Adviser may consider appropriate to reflect any consolidation or subdivision of any Ordinary Shares or
the issue of Ordinary Shares by way of capitalisation of profits or reserves, or any like or similar event.

Dividend means any dividend or distribution, whether of cash, assets or other property, and whenever
paid or made and however described (and for these purposes a distribution of assets includes without
limitation an issue of shares or other securities credited as fully or partly paid up by way of
capitalisation of profits or reserves) provided that:

(a) where a cash Dividend is announced which is to be, or may at the election of a holder or holders of
Ordinary Shares be, satisfied by the issue or delivery of Ordinary Shares or other property or
assets, then, for the purposes of the above definition, the Dividend in question shall be treated as a
Dividend of (i) the cash Dividend so announced or (ii) the Fair Market Value, on the date of
announcement of such Dividend, of the Ordinary Shares or other property or assets to be issued or
delivered in satisfaction of such Dividend (or which would be issued if all holders of Ordinary
Shares elected therefor, regardless of whether any such election is made) if the Fair Market Value
of such Ordinary Shares or other property or assets is greater than the Fair Market Value of the
cash Dividend so announced;

(b) any issue of Ordinary Shares falling within Condition 5(b)(ii) shall be disregarded; and

(c) a purchase or redemption of share capital by the Issuer shall not constitute a Dividend unless in the
case of purchases of Ordinary Shares by or on behalf of the Issuer, the Volume Weighted Average
Price per Ordinary Share (before expenses) on any one day in respect of such purchases exceeds
by more than 5 per cent. the closing price of the Ordinary Shares on the London Stock Exchange
on the immediately preceding dealing day as derived from the Daily Official List of the London
Stock Exchange at the opening of business either: (1) on that day, or (2) where an announcement
(excluding for the avoidance of doubt for these purposes, any general authority for such purchases
or redemptions approved by a general meeting of Shareholders of the Issuer or any notice


-----

convening such a meeting of Shareholders) has been made of the intention to purchase Ordinary
Shares at some future date at a specified price, on the dealing day immediately preceding the date
of such announcement and, if in the case of either (1) or (2), the relevant day is not a dealing day,
the immediately preceding dealing day, in which case such purchase shall be deemed to constitute
a Dividend to the extent that the aggregate price paid (before expenses) in respect of such Ordinary
Shares purchased by the Issuer exceeds the product of: (i) 105 per cent. of the closing price of the
Ordinary Shares determined as aforesaid; and (ii) the number of Ordinary Shares so purchased.

Fair Market Value means, with respect to any property on any date, the fair market value of that
property as determined in good faith by an Independent Financial Adviser provided that: (i) the Fair
Market Value of a cash Dividend paid or to be paid shall be the amount of such cash Dividend; (ii) the
Fair Market Value of any other cash amount shall be the amount of such cash; (iii) where options,
warrants or other rights are publicly traded in a market of adequate liquidity (as determined by an
Independent Financial Adviser) the fair market value of such options, warrants or other rights shall
equal the arithmetic mean of the daily closing prices of such options, warrants or other rights during the
period of five trading days on the relevant market commencing on the first such trading day such
options, warrants or other rights are publicly traded, or such shorter period as such options, warrants or
other rights are publicly traded; and (iv) in the case of (i) converted into sterling (if declared or paid in a
currency other than sterling) at the rate of exchange used to determine the amount payable to
Shareholders who were paid or are to be paid the cash Dividend in sterling; and in the case of (ii) and
(iii) converted into sterling (if expressed in a currency other than sterling) at such rate of exchange as
may be determined in good faith by an Independent Financial Adviser to be the spot rate ruling at the
close of business on that date (or if no such rate is available on that date the equivalent rate on the
immediately preceding date on which such a rate is available).

(iv) If and whenever the Issuer shall issue Ordinary Shares to Shareholders as a class by way of rights, or
issue or grant to Shareholders as a class by way of rights, options, warrants or other rights to subscribe
for or purchase any Ordinary Shares, in each case at a price per Ordinary Share which is less than
95 per cent. of the Current Market Price per Ordinary Share on the dealing day immediately preceding
the date of the first public announcement of the terms of the issue or grant of such Ordinary Shares,
options, warrants or other rights, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion
Price in force immediately prior to such issue or grant by the following fraction:

A + B

A + C

where:

A is the number of Ordinary Shares in issue immediately before such announcement;

B is the number of Ordinary Shares which the aggregate amount (if any) payable for the Ordinary
Shares issued by way of rights, or for the options or warrants or other rights issued by way of
rights and for the total number of Ordinary Shares comprised therein would purchase at such
Current Market Price per Ordinary Share; and

C is the number of Ordinary Shares issued or, as the case may be, comprised in the grant.

Such adjustment shall become effective on the first date on which the Ordinary Shares are traded
ex-rights, ex-options or ex-warrants on the London Stock Exchange.

(v) If and whenever the Issuer shall issue any securities (other than Ordinary Shares or options, warrants or
other rights to subscribe for or purchase any Ordinary Shares) to Shareholders as a class by way of
rights or grant to Shareholders as a class by way of rights any options, warrants or other rights to
subscribe for or purchase any securities (other than Ordinary Shares or options, warrants or other rights
to subscribe for or purchase Ordinary Shares), the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the
Conversion Price in force immediately prior to such issue or grant by the following fraction:

A – B

A

where:

A is the Current Market Price of one Ordinary Share on the dealing day immediately preceding the
first date on which the terms of such issue or grant are publicly announced; and


-----

B is the Fair Market Value on the date of such announcement of the portion of the rights attributable
to one Ordinary Share.

Such adjustment shall become effective on the first date on which the Ordinary Shares are traded
ex-rights, ex-options or ex-warrants on the London Stock Exchange.

(vi) If and whenever the Issuer shall issue (otherwise than as mentioned in sub-paragraph (iv) above) wholly
for cash any Ordinary Shares (other than Ordinary Shares issued on the exercise of Conversion Rights
or on the exercise of any rights of conversion into, or exchange or subscription for, Ordinary Shares),
or grant (otherwise than as mentioned in paragraph (iv) above) wholly for cash or for no consideration
any options, warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase any Ordinary Shares (other than the
Bonds, which term shall include any further bonds issued pursuant to Condition 18 and consolidated
and forming a single series with the Bonds), in each case at a price per Ordinary Share which is less
than 95 per cent. of the Current Market Price per Ordinary Share on the dealing day immediately
preceding the date of the first public announcement of the terms of such issue or grant, the Conversion
Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price in force immediately prior to such issue by
the following fraction:

A + B

A + C

where:

A is the number of Ordinary Shares in issue immediately before the issue of such additional Ordinary
Shares or the grant of such options, warrants or rights;

B is the number of Ordinary Shares which the aggregate consideration (if any) receivable for the
issue of such additional Ordinary Shares or, as the case may be, for the Ordinary Shares to be
issued or otherwise made available upon the exercise of any such options, warrants or rights,
would purchase at such Current Market Price per Ordinary Share; and

C is the maximum number of Ordinary Shares to be issued pursuant to such issue of such additional
Ordinary Shares or upon exercise of such options, warrants or rights.

Such adjustment shall become effective on the date of issue of such additional Ordinary Shares or, as
the case may be, the grant of such options, warrants or rights.

(vii) If and whenever the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer or (at the direction or request of or pursuant
to any arrangements with the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer) any other company, person or
entity (otherwise than as mentioned in paragraphs (iv), (v) or (vi) above) shall issue wholly for cash or
for no consideration any securities (other than the Bonds, which term for this purpose excludes any

Bonds) which by their terms of issue carry (directly or indirectly) rights of conversion into, or exchange
or subscription for, Ordinary Shares issued or to be issued by the Issuer (or shall grant any such rights in
respect of existing securities so issued) or securities which by their terms might be redesignated as
Ordinary Shares, and the consideration per Ordinary Share receivable upon conversion, exchange,
subscription or redesignation is less than 95 per cent. of the Current Market Price per Ordinary Share on
the dealing day last preceding the date of the first public announcement of the terms of issue of such
securities (or the terms of such grant), the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the
Conversion Price in force immediately prior to such issue (or grant) by the following fraction:

A + B

A + C

where:

A is the number of Ordinary Shares in issue immediately before such issue or grant (but where the
relevant securities carry rights of conversion into or rights of exchange or subscription for
Ordinary Shares which have been issued by the Issuer for the purposes of or in connection with
such issue, less the number of such Ordinary Shares so issued);

B is the number of Ordinary Shares which the aggregate consideration (if any) receivable for the
Ordinary Shares to be issued or otherwise made available upon conversion or exchange or upon
exercise of the right of subscription attached to such securities or, as the case may be, for the


-----

Ordinary Shares to be issued or to arise from any such redesignation would purchase at such
Current Market Price per Ordinary Share; and

C is the maximum number of Ordinary Shares to be issued or otherwise made available upon
conversion or exchange of such securities or upon the exercise of such right of subscription
attached thereto at the initial conversion, exchange or subscription price or rate or, as the case may
be, the maximum number of Ordinary Shares to be issued or to arise from any such redesignation,

provided that if at the time of issue of the relevant securities or date of grant of such rights (the
Specified Date) such number of Ordinary Shares is to be determined by reference to the application of
a formula or other variable feature or the occurrence of any event at some subsequent time (which may
be when such securities are converted or exchanged or rights of subscription are exercised or, as the
case may be, such securities are redesignated or at such other time as may be provided) then for the
purposes of this paragraph (vii), ‘‘C’’ shall be determined by the application of such formula or variable
feature or as if the relevant event occurs or had occurred as at the Specified Date and as if such
conversion, exchange, subscription, purchase or acquisition or, as the case may be, redesignation had
taken place on the Specified Date.

Such adjustment shall become effective on the date of issue or grant of such securities.

(viii) if and whenever there shall be any modification of the rights of conversion, exchange or subscription
attaching to any such securities (other than the Bonds and any further bonds issued pursuant to
Condition 18 and consolidated and forming a single series therewith) as are mentioned in paragraph
(vii) above (other than in accordance with the terms (including terms as to adjustment) applicable to
such securities) so that following such modification the consideration per Ordinary Share receivable has
been reduced and is less than 95 per cent. of the Current Market Price per Ordinary Share on the dealing
day last preceding the date of the first public announcement of the proposals for such modification, the
Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price in force immediately prior to
such modification by the following fraction:

A + B

A + C

where:

A is the number of Ordinary Shares in issue immediately before such modification (but where the
relevant securities carry rights of conversion into or rights of exchange or subscription for
Ordinary Shares which have been issued by the Issuer for the purposes of or in connection with
such issue, less the number of such Ordinary Shares so issued);

B is the number of Ordinary Shares which the aggregate consideration (if any) receivable for the
Ordinary Shares to be issued or otherwise made available upon conversion or exchange or upon
exercise of the right of subscription attached to the securities so modified would purchase at such
Current Market Price per Ordinary Share or, if lower, the existing conversion, exchange or
subscription price of such securities; and

C is the maximum number of Ordinary Shares to be issued or otherwise made available upon
conversion or exchange of such securities or upon the exercise of such rights of subscription
attached thereto at the modified conversion, exchange or subscription price or rate but giving
credit in such manner as an investment bank or Independent Financial Adviser shall consider
appropriate for any previous adjustment under this paragraph or paragraph (vii) above,

provided that if at the time of such modification (the Specified Date) such number of Ordinary Shares
is to be determined by reference to the application of a formula or other variable feature or the
occurrence of any event at some subsequent time (which may be when such securities are converted or
exchanged or rights of subscription are exercised or at such other time as may be provided) then for the
purposes of this paragraph (viii), ‘‘C’’ shall be determined by the application of such formula or
variable feature or as if the relevant event occurs or had occurred as at the Specified Date and as if such
conversion, exchange or subscription had taken place on the Specified Date.

Such adjustment shall become effective on the date of modification of the rights of conversion,
exchange or subscription attaching to such securities.

(ix) If and whenever the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer or (at the direction or request of or pursuant
to any arrangements with the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer) any other company, person or


-----

entity shall offer any securities in connection with which offer Shareholders as a class are entitled to
participate in arrangements whereby such securities may be acquired by them (except where the
Conversion Price falls to be[-] adjusted under sub-paragraph (iv) above (or would fall to be so adjusted if
the relevant issue or grant was at less than 95 per cent. of the Current Market Price per Ordinary Share
on the relevant dealing day) or under paragraph (v) above) the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by
multiplying the Conversion Price in force immediately before the making of such offer by the following
fraction:

A – B

A

where:

A is the Current Market Price of one Ordinary Share on the dealing day immediately preceding the
date on which the terms of such offer are publicly announced; and

B is the Fair Market Value on the date of such announcement of the portion of the relevant offer
attributable to one Ordinary Share.

Such adjustment shall become effective on the first date on which the Ordinary Shares are traded exrights on the London Stock Exchange.

(x) If an offer is made to all (or as nearly as may be practicable all) Shareholders (or all (or as nearly as
may be practicable all) such Shareholders other than the offeror and/or any associate of the offeror
(as defined in Section 430E(4) of the Companies Act 1985)), to acquire all or a majority of the issued
ordinary share capital of the Issuer or if any person proposes a scheme with regard to such acquisition
(other than a Newco Scheme (as defined below)) and (such offer or scheme having become or been
declared unconditional in all respects) the Issuer becomes aware that the right to cast more than
50 per cent. of the votes which may ordinarily be cast on a poll at a general meeting of the Issuer has or
will become unconditionally vested in the offeror and/or such associate as aforesaid (a Relevant
Event), the Conversion Price shall be adjusted as set out below (but in each case adjusted, if
appropriate, proportionately on each adjustment to the Conversion Price under the foregoing provisions
of this Condition 5(b) and Condition 5(b)(xi) below), provided that any adjustment to the Conversion
Price pursuant to this Condition 5(b)(x) shall only apply to Bonds in respect of which Conversion
Rights are duly exercised and the Conversion Date falls within 60 calendar days following the
occurrence of the Relevant Event giving rise to the adjustment, or, if later, 60 calendar days following
the date on which notice of such Relevant Event is given to Bondholders by or on behalf of the Issuer:

As used in these Conditions, Newco Scheme means a scheme of arrangement which effects the
interposition of a limited liability company (Newco) between the Shareholders of the Issuer
immediately prior to the scheme of arrangement (the Existing Shareholders) and the Issuer; provided
that immediately after completion of the scheme of arrangement the Existing Shareholders are the only
shareholders of Newco and that all Subsidiaries of the Issuer immediately prior to the scheme of
arrangement (other than Newco if Newco is then a Subsidiary of the Issuer) of the Issuer are
Subsidiaries of the Issuer (or of Newco) immediately after the scheme of arrangement and immediately
after completion of the scheme of arrangement Newco is substituted under the Bonds and the Trust
Deed in place of the Issuer in accordance with the Trust Deed and such other adjustments are made to
these Conditions and the Trust Deed as are necessary, in the opinion of the Trustee, to ensure that the
Bonds may be converted into shares in Newco.

(xi) If the Issuer (after consultation with the Trustee) determines that an adjustment should be made to the
Conversion Price as a result of one or more events or circumstances not referred to above in this
Condition 5(b) (even if the relevant event or circumstance is specifically excluded from the operation of
sub-paragraphs (i) to (x) above), the Issuer shall, at its own expense and acting reasonably, request an
Independent Financial Adviser to determine as soon as practicable what adjustment (if any) to the


-----

Conversion Price is fair and reasonable to take account thereof and the date on which such adjustment
should take effect and upon such determination such adjustment (if any) shall be made and shall take
effect in accordance with such determination, provided that an adjustment shall only be made pursuant
to this Condition 5(b)(xi) if such Independent Financial Adviser is so requested to make such a
determination not more than 21 days after the date on which the relevant event or circumstance arises.

(xii) For the purpose of any calculation of the consideration receivable pursuant to Condition 5(b)(vi), (vii)
and (viii), the following provisions shall apply:

(a) the aggregate consideration receivable for Ordinary Shares issued for cash shall be the amount of
such cash provided that in no case shall any deduction be made for any commission, fees or any
expenses paid or incurred by the Issuer for any underwriting of the issue or otherwise in
connection therewith;

(b) (x) the aggregate consideration receivable for Ordinary Shares to be issued or otherwise made
available upon the conversion or exchange of any securities shall be deemed to be the
consideration received or receivable for any such securities, and (y) the aggregate consideration
receivable for Ordinary Shares to be issued or otherwise made available upon the exercise of rights
of subscription attached to any securities or upon the exercise of any options, warrants or rights
shall be deemed to be that part (which may be the whole) of the consideration received or
receivable for such securities or, as the case may be, for such options, warrants or rights which is
attributed by the Issuer to such rights of subscription or, as the case may be, such options, warrants
or rights or, if no part of such consideration is so attributed or the Trustee so requires by notice in
writing to the Issuer, the Fair Market Value of such rights of subscription or, as the case may be,
such options, warrants or rights as at the date of the first public announcement of the terms of issue
of such securities or, as the case may be, such options, warrants or rights, plus in the case of each
of (x) and (y) above, the additional minimum consideration (if any) upon the conversion or
exchange of such securities, or upon the exercise of such rights of subscription attached thereto or,
as the case may be, upon exercise of such options, warrants or rights (the consideration in all such
cases to be determined subject to the proviso in (a) above) and (z) the consideration per Ordinary
Share receivable upon the conversion or exchange of, or upon the exercise of such rights of
subscription attached to, such securities or, as the case may be, upon the exercise of such options,
warrants or rights shall be the aggregate consideration referred to in (x) or (y) above (as the case
may be) converted into pounds sterling if such consideration is expressed in a currency other than
pounds sterling at such rate of exchange as may be determined in good faith by an Independent
Financial Adviser to be the spot rate ruling at the close of business on the date of the first public
announcement of the terms of issue of such securities, divided by the number of Ordinary Shares
to be issued upon such conversion or exchange or exercise at the initial conversion, exchange or
subscription price or rate.

Current Market Price means, in respect of an Ordinary Share at a particular date, the average of the bid
and offer quotations published in the London Stock Exchange’s Daily Official List for one Ordinary Share for the
five consecutive dealing days ending on the dealing day immediately preceding such date; provided that if at any
time during the said five day period the Ordinary Shares shall have been quoted ex-dividend (or ex- any other
entitlement) and during some other part of that period the Ordinary Shares shall have been quoted cum-dividend
(or cum- any other entitlement) then:

(a) if the Ordinary Shares to be issued do not rank for the dividend (or entitlement) in question, the
quotations on the dates on which the Ordinary Shares shall have been quoted cum-dividend (or cumsuch other entitlement) shall for the purpose of this definition be deemed to be the amount thereof
reduced by an amount equal to the amount of that dividend or other cash entitlement or, as the case may
be, the Fair Market Value of any entitlement or dividend (where that is other than cash) per Ordinary
Share as at the date of announcement of such dividend or entitlement (excluding any associated tax
credit and less the tax (if any) falling to be deducted on payment thereof to a resident of the United
Kingdom); or

(b) if the Ordinary Shares to be issued do rank for the dividend in question, the quotations on the dates on
which the Ordinary Shares shall have been quoted ex-dividend (or ex- any other entitlement) shall for
the purpose of this definition be deemed to be the amount thereof increased by such similar amount, and
provided further that if the Ordinary Shares on each of the said five dealing days have been quoted
cum-dividend (or cum- such other entitlement) in respect of a dividend (or other entitlement) which has
been declared or announced but the Ordinary Shares to be issued do not rank for that dividend (or other


-----

entitlement) the quotations on each of such dates shall for the purposes of this definition be deemed to
be the amount thereof reduced by an amount equal to the amount of that dividend or other cash
entitlement or, as the case may be, the Fair Market Value of any entitlement or dividend (where that is
other than cash) per Ordinary Share as at the date of announcement of such dividend or entitlement
(excluding any associated tax credit and less the tax (if any) falling to be deducted on payment thereof
to a resident of the United Kingdom),

provided that if such bid and offer quotations are not available on each of the said five dealing days, then the
average of such bid and offer quotations which are available in that five dealing day period shall be used
(subject to a minimum of two such bid and offer quotations) and if only one or no such bid and offer
quotation is available in the relevant period the average bid and offer quotations shall be determined in good
faith by an Independent Financial Adviser.

dealing day means a day on which the London Stock Exchange or any other stock exchange on which the
Ordinary Shares are listed or traded is open for business.

securities includes, without limitation, shares in the share capital of the Issuer and options, warrants or other
rights to subscribe for or purchase or acquire shares in the capital of the Issuer.

References to any issue or offer to Shareholders ‘‘as a class’’ or ‘‘by way of rights’’ shall be taken to be
references to an issue or offer to all or substantially all Shareholders other than Shareholders to whom, by reason
of the laws of any territory or requirements of any recognised regulatory body or any other stock exchange in any
territory or in connection with fractional entitlements, it is determined not to make such issue or offer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, where the circumstances giving rise to any adjustment pursuant to
this Condition 5(b) have already resulted or will result in an adjustment to the Conversion Price or where the
circumstances giving rise to any adjustment arise by virtue of any other circumstances which have already given
or will give rise to an adjustment to the Conversion Price or where more than one event which gives rise to an
adjustment to the Conversion Price occurs within such a short period of time that, in the opinion of the Issuer, a
modification to the operation of the adjustment provisions is required to give the intended result, such
modification shall be made to the operation of the adjustment provisions as may be advised by an Independent
Financial Adviser to be in its opinion appropriate to give the intended result and provided further that, for the
avoidance of doubt, the issue of Ordinary Shares pursuant to the exercise of Conversion Rights shall not result in
an adjustment to the Conversion Price.

(c) Retroactive Adjustments

If the Conversion Date in relation to any Bond shall be after the record date for any such issue, distribution,
grant or offer (as the case may be) as is mentioned in Condition 5(b)(ii) to (v) and (ix), or any such issue as is
mentioned in Condition 5(b)(vi) and (vii) which is made to the Shareholders or any of them, but before the
relevant adjustment becomes effective under Condition 5(b), the Issuer shall (conditional upon the relevant
adjustment becoming effective) procure that there shall be issued to the converting Bondholder, in accordance
with the instructions contained in the Conversion Notice or, as the case may be, to the Trustee or as directed by
the Trustee (in each case subject to any applicable exchange control or other laws or other regulations), such
additional number of Ordinary Shares (if any) as, together with the Ordinary Shares issued or to be issued on
conversion of the relevant Bond, is equal to the number of Ordinary Shares which would have been required to be
issued on conversion of such Bond if the relevant adjustment (more particularly referred to in the said provisions
of Condition 5(b)) to the Conversion Price had in fact been made and become effective immediately after the
relevant record date. Such additional Ordinary Shares will be allotted within one month after the relevant
Conversion Date or, if later, within one month after the date of issue of Ordinary Shares or other securities if the
adjustment results from the issue of Ordinary Shares, and certificates for such Ordinary Shares (if the Ordinary
Shares are in certificated form) will be dispatched by mail free of charge (but uninsured and at the risk of the
person entitled thereto) within such period of one month.

(d) Decision of Independent Financial Adviser

If any doubt shall arise as to the appropriate adjustment to the Conversion Price, and following consultation
between the Issuer and an Independent Financial Adviser, a written opinion of such Independent Financial
Adviser in respect of such adjustment to the Conversion Price shall be conclusive and binding on all concerned,
save in the case of manifest or proven error.


-----

(e) Ordinary Shares may not be Issued at a Discount

The Conversion Price may not be reduced so that on conversion of the Bonds, Ordinary Shares would fall to
be issued at a discount to their nominal or par value.

(f) Employees’ Share Schemes

No adjustment will be made to the Conversion Price where Ordinary Shares or other securities (including
rights, warrants and options) are issued, offered, exercised, allotted, appropriated, modified or granted to, or for
the benefit of, employees or former employees (including Directors holding or formerly holding executive office
or the personal service company of any such person) of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or any associated
company or to trustees to be held for the benefit of any such person, in any such case pursuant to any employees’
share scheme (as defined in Section 743 of the Companies Act 1985 or any modification or re-enactment thereof).

(g) Rounding Down

On any adjustment, the resultant Conversion Price, if not an integral multiple of £0.01, shall be rounded
down to the nearest whole multiple of £0.01. No adjustment shall be made to the Conversion Price where such
adjustment (rounded down if applicable) would be less than 1 per cent. of the Conversion Price then in effect.
Any adjustment not required to be made and/or any amount by which the Conversion Price has been rounded
down, shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment, and such subsequent
adjustment shall be made on the basis that the adjustment not required to be made had been made at the relevant
time.

(h) Selection of Independent Financial Adviser

If the Issuer fails to select an Independent Financial Adviser when required for the purposes of this
Condition and such failure continues for a reasonable period (as determined by the Trustee), the Trustee shall be
entitled to select such Independent Financial Adviser.

(i) Cash Alternative Election

The Issuer may make an election from time to time (a Cash Alternative Election) by giving prior notice
(a Cash Alternative Election Notice) to the Trustee and the Bondholders to satisfy the Conversion Rights
attaching to any Bonds in respect of which the Conversion Date falls on or after the Cash Election Date specified
in such Cash Alternative Election Notice and prior to the Revocation Date specified in any subsequent notice of
revocation (a Notice of Revocation) of such Cash Alternative Election (as provided below) by making payment,
or procuring that payment be made on its behalf, to the relevant Bondholder or, as the case may be, the Trustee of
a sum in cash equal to the Cash Alternative Amount in respect of the Ordinary Shares (including, for this purpose,
any fractions of Ordinary Shares) which, in the absence of any such Cash Alternative Election, would have fallen
to be delivered to the relevant Bondholder or, as the case may be, the Trustee, together with any other amount
payable by the Issuer to such Bondholder or the Trustee in respect of or relating to the relevant exercise of
Conversion Rights.

The Issuer shall pay the Cash Alternative Amount, or procure that the Cash Alternative Amount is paid, by
not later than the fifth dealing day following the end of the Cash Alternative Calculation Period or, if that is not a
business day in London, the next following such day by a pounds sterling cheque drawn on, or by transfer to a
pounds sterling account with, a bank in London in accordance with instructions contained in the relevant
Conversion Notice or, as the case may be, as instructed by the Trustee.

The Issuer may at any time and from time to time revoke a Cash Alternative Election by giving a Notice of
Revocation to the Trustee and the Bondholders specifying the Revocation Date. The Issuer may exercise its rights
as provided above, both to make and to revoke a Cash Alternative Election, as often as it thinks fit.

Cash Election Date means the date specified as such in a Cash Alternative Exercise Notice and which shall
be not earlier than 10 nor later than 15 days after the date such notice is given.

Revocation Date means the date specified as such in a Notice of Revocation and which shall be not earlier
than 10 nor later than 15 days after the date such notice is given.

(j) Procedure for Conversion

A Conversion Right may be exercised by a Bondholder during the Conversion Period by delivering the
relevant Bond to the specified office of any Paying and Conversion Agent, during its usual business hours,


-----

accompanied by a duly completed and signed notice of conversion (a Conversion Notice) in the form (for the time
being current) obtainable from any Paying and Conversion Agent. Conversion Rights shall be exercised subject in
each case to any applicable fiscal or other laws or regulations applicable in the jurisdiction in which the specified
office of the Paying and Conversion Agent to whom the relevant Conversion Notice is delivered is located.

A Conversion Right may be exercised only in respect of the whole of the principal amount of a Bond.

A Conversion Notice, once delivered, shall be irrevocable.

The conversion date in respect of a Bond (the Conversion Date) shall be: (i) in the case of an exercise of
Conversion Rights by a Bondholder, the London business day immediately following the date of such delivery
and, if applicable, any payment to be made as provided below; or (ii) in the case of exercise of Conversion Rights
by the Trustee pursuant to Condition 5(k), the relevant redemption date, save that for the purposes of calculating
the amount of interest (if any) payable on such conversion in the case of an exercise of Conversion Rights by the
Trustee, the Conversion Date shall be the date which would have been the Conversion Date had Conversion
Rights been exercised by holders of the relevant Unexercised Bonds on the last day of the Conversion Period.

Each Bond should be delivered upon exercise of Conversion Rights together with all unmatured Coupons
relating to it, failing which the relevant holder will be required to pay the full amount of any such missing
unmatured Coupon. Each amount so paid will be repaid in the manner specified in Condition 7 against
presentation and surrender (or, in the case of part payment only, endorsement) of the relevant missing Coupon at
any time after the relevant Conversion Date and before the expiry of 10 years after the Relevant Date in respect of
the relevant Bond (whether or not a Coupon would otherwise have become void pursuant to Condition 12), but
not thereafter.

A Bondholder or the Trustee exercising a Conversion Right must pay (in the case of the Trustee by means of
deduction from the net proceeds of sale referred to in Condition 5(k) or from amounts otherwise available to the
Trustee in respect of such exercise) any taxes and capital, stamp, issue and registration duties arising on
conversion (other than any taxes or capital duties or stamp duties payable in the United Kingdom in respect of the
allotment and issue of any Ordinary Shares on such conversion, which shall be paid by the Issuer) and such
Bondholder or the Trustee (as the case may be) must pay (in the case of the Trustee, by way of deduction from the
net proceeds of sale as provided in Condition 5(k) or from amounts otherwise available to the Trustee in respect
of such exercise) all, if any, taxes arising by reference to any disposal or deemed disposal of a Bond or interest
therein in connection with such conversion.

The Ordinary Shares will not be available for issue: (i) to, or to a nominee or agent for, Euroclear,
Clearstream, Luxembourg, First Chicago Clearing Center or any other person providing a clearance service
within the meaning of Section 96 of the Finance Act 1986 of the United Kingdom; or (ii) to a person, or nominee
or agent for a person, whose business is or includes issuing depositary receipts within the meaning of Section 93
of the Finance Act 1986 of the United Kingdom, in each case at any time prior to the ‘‘abolition day’’ as defined
in Section 111(1) of the Finance Act 1990 of the United Kingdom.

Ordinary Shares to be issued on conversion of the Bonds will be issued in uncertificated form through the
dematerialised securities trading system generated by CRESTCo Limited, known as CREST, unless the relevant
Bondholder or, as the case may be, the Trustee elects to receive the Ordinary Shares in certificated registered
form or, at the time of issue, the Ordinary Shares are not a participating security in CREST. Where Ordinary
Shares are to be issued through CREST, they will be delivered to the account specified by the relevant
Bondholder in the relevant Conversion Notice or, as the case may be, as specified by the Trustee by a date which
is generally expected to be not later than seven London business days following the relevant Conversion Date.
Where Ordinary Shares are to be issued in certificated form, a certificate in respect thereof will be dispatched by
mail free of charge (but uninsured and at the risk of the person entitled thereto) to the relevant Bondholder or as it
may direct in the relevant Conversion Notice, or, in the case of the exercise of Conversion Rights by the Trustee,
as directed by the Trustee within 28 days following the relevant Conversion Date.

(k) Conversion by the Trustee

The Trustee may, in its absolute discretion (and without any responsibility for any loss occasioned thereby),
within the period commencing on the date five days immediately prior to, and ending at the close of business on
the London business day immediately prior to, the date fixed for redemption from time to time of any of the
Bonds under Condition 6(a) or (b), elect (on behalf of the relevant Bondholders) by notice in writing to the Issuer
to exercise the Conversion Rights in respect of the Bonds due for redemption on such date and in respect of which
Conversion Rights have not previously been exercised by Bondholders (Unexercised Bonds) at the Conversion
Price applicable on the Conversion Date, provided that all (if any) necessary consents have been obtained and the


-----

Trustee is satisfied or is advised by an independent investment bank of international repute appointed by the
Trustee (the expense of such appointment to form part of the Trustee’s Expenses (as defined below)) at the
expense of the Issuer that the net proceeds of an immediate sale of the Ordinary Shares arising from such
conversion (assuming for this purpose that a Cash Alternative Election is not in effect on the relevant Conversion
Date and assuming that the Conversion Amount in respect of each £1,000 principal amount of Bonds is £1,000),
disregarding any liability (other than a liability of the Trustee) to taxation or the payment of any capital, stamp,
transfer, issue or registration duties consequent thereon, together in each case with any other amount payable by
the Issuer in respect of such exercise, would be likely to exceed by 5 per cent. or more the amount of the
redemption moneys and interest which would otherwise be payable in respect of such Unexercised Bonds.

Save as provided in Condition 5(m), no interest shall accrue from the Interest Payment Date immediately
preceding the Conversion Date (or, if such date falls before the first Interest Payment Date, since the Closing
Date) in respect of such Unexercised Bonds in respect of which the Trustee’s election as aforesaid shall have
been made.

If a Cash Alternative Election is not in effect on the relevant Conversion Date, all of the Ordinary Shares
delivered on such conversion shall be sold by, or on behalf of, the Trustee as soon as practicable and (subject to
any necessary consents being obtained, and to the deduction by the Trustee of any amount which it determines to
be payable in respect of its liability to taxation and the payment of any capital, stamp, transfer, issue or
registration duties (if any) and any costs incurred by the Trustee in connection with the transfer, delivery and sale
thereof (Trustee’s Expenses)) the net proceeds of sale together with the Redemption Price in respect of the
redemption of the Cash Settled Amount in respect of such Unexercised Bonds and accrued interest (if any)
payable under Condition 5(m) and any other amount payable by the Issuer in respect of the relevant exercise in
respect of the Unexercised Bonds shall be held by the Trustee and distributed rateably to the holders of such
Unexercised Bonds in accordance with Condition 7.

If a Cash Alternative Election is in effect on the relevant Conversion Date, the Cash Alternative Amount
paid to the Trustee together with accrued interest (if any) payable under Condition 5(m) in respect of the
Unexercised Bonds and any other amount payable by the Issuer in respect of the relevant exercise shall, subject to
the deduction by the Trustee of the Trustee’s Expenses, be held by the Trustee and distributed rateably to the
holders of the Unexercised Bonds in accordance with Condition 7.

For the purposes of any distribution to holders of Unexercised Bonds and subject to Condition 5(m), any
Coupon relating to an Interest Payment Date falling on or after what would have been the Conversion Date in
respect of such Unexercised Bonds if Conversion Rights had been exercised by the holder(s) thereof on the last
day of the Conversion Period shall be treated as an unmatured Coupon.

Save as provided in Condition 5(m), if the date fixed for redemption in respect of such Unexercised Bonds
falls during a period commencing on an Interest Payment Date and ending on the sixth calendar day after such
Interest Payment Date (both dates inclusive) a sum equal to the amount of the interest due on such Interest
Payment Date will be deducted from the net proceeds of sale payable to the relevant holders and shall be paid to
the Issuer. The amount of such net proceeds of sale payable to a holder of Unexercised Bonds pursuant to this
Condition 5(k) shall be treated for all purposes as the full amount due from the Issuer in respect of such
Unexercised Bonds.

The Trustee shall have no liability in respect of the exercise or non-exercise of its discretion pursuant to this
Condition 5(k) or the timing of such exercise or in respect of any such sale of Ordinary Shares whether for the
timing of any such sale or the price at which any such Ordinary Shares are sold, or the inability to sell any such
Ordinary Shares or otherwise.

(l) Ordinary Shares

(i) The Ordinary Shares issued upon conversion of the Bonds will be fully paid and non-assessable and
will in all respects rank pari passu with the fully paid Ordinary Shares in issue on the relevant
Conversion Date (except for any right excluded by mandatory provisions of applicable law), except that
the Ordinary Shares so issued will not rank for any rights, distributions or payments the record date or
other due date for the establishment of entitlement for which falls prior to the relevant Conversion Date.

(ii) Save as provided in Condition 5(m), no payment or adjustment shall be made on conversion for any
interest which otherwise would have accrued on the relevant Bonds since the last Interest Payment Date
preceding the Conversion Date relating to such Bonds (or, if such Conversion Date falls before the first
Interest Payment Date, since the Closing Date).


-----

(m) Interest on Conversion
If any notice requiring the redemption of any Bonds is given pursuant to Condition 6(b) on or after the
fifteenth business day prior to a record date which has occurred since the last Interest Payment Date (or in the
case of the first Interest Period, since the Closing Date) (whether such notice is given before, on or after such
record date) in respect of any dividend or distribution payable in respect of the Ordinary Shares where such notice
specifies a date for redemption falling on or prior to the date which is 14 days after the Interest Payment Date next
following such record date, interest shall accrue on Bonds in respect of which Conversion Rights shall have been
exercised or in respect of which the Trustee shall have exercised its rights pursuant to Condition 5(k) and in any
such case in respect of which the Conversion Date falls after such record date and on or prior to the Interest
Payment Date next following such record date in respect of such dividend or distribution, in each case from and
including the preceding Interest Payment Date (or, if such Conversion Date falls before the first Interest Payment
Date, from the Closing Date) to but excluding such Conversion Date. The Issuer shall pay any such interest or
procure that any such interest is paid by not later than 14 days after the relevant Conversion Date by pounds
sterling cheque drawn on, or by transfer to a sterling account maintained with, a bank in London in accordance
with instructions given by the relevant Bondholder or, in the case of the exercise of Conversion Rights by the
Trustee, the Trustee.

(n) Purchase or Redemption by the Issuer of its Own Shares
The Issuer may exercise such rights as it may from time to time enjoy to purchase its own shares (including
Ordinary Shares) without the consent of the Bondholders or Couponholders.

(o) Issuer to notify Bondholders of adjustments to Conversion Price
Notice of any adjustments to the Conversion Price shall be given to Bondholders in accordance with
Condition 17 as soon as practicable after the determination thereof.

6. Redemption and Purchase
(a) Final Redemption
Unless previously purchased and cancelled, redeemed or converted as herein provided, the Bonds will be
redeemed at their principal amount on the Final Maturity Date. The Bonds may only be redeemed at the option of
the Issuer prior to the Final Maturity Date in accordance with Condition 6(b).

(b) Redemption at the Option of the Issuer
On giving not less than 30 nor more than 90 days’ notice (an Optional Redemption Notice) to the Trustee
and the Bondholders in accordance with Condition 17, the Issuer may: (i) at any time on or after 16th July, 2007
redeem all, but not some only, of the Bonds at their principal amount, together with accrued interest, provided
that no such redemption may be made unless the middle market price (derived from the Official List) of the
Ordinary Shares for at least 20 dealing days during the period of 30 dealing days ending not earlier than the fifth
dealing day before the date of the Optional Redemption Notice shall be at least 130 per cent. of the Conversion
Price in effect on each such dealing day; or (ii) redeem all, but not some only, of the Bonds on the date (the
Optional Redemption Date) specified in the Optional Redemption Notice at their principal amount as at the
Optional Redemption Date together with accrued interest up to but excluding the Optional Redemption Date if
prior to the date the relevant Optional Redemption Notice is given, Conversion Rights shall have been exercised
and/or purchases (and corresponding cancellations) effected in respect of 85 per cent. or more in principal amount
of the Bonds originally issued. The principal amount of the Bonds originally issued shall be the aggregate of the
principal amount of the Bonds and the principal amount of any further bonds issued pursuant to Condition 18 and
consolidated and forming a single series with the Bonds but shall not take account of any Conversion Rights
exercised or purchases and corresponding cancellations.

(c) Optional Redemption Notice
Any Optional Redemption Notice shall be irrevocable. Any such notice shall specify: (i) the Optional
Redemption Date; (ii) the Conversion Price, the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds outstanding (as defined
in the Trust Deed) and the closing price of the Ordinary Shares as derived from the Daily Official List of the
London Stock Exchange, in each case as at the latest practicable date prior to the publication of the Optional
Redemption Notice; and (iii) the last day on which Conversion Rights may be exercised by Bondholders.

(d) Purchase
Subject to the requirements (if any) of the UK Listing Authority or the London Stock Exchange or any other
stock exchange on which the Bonds may be listed at the relevant time, the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer
may at any time purchase Bonds in the open market or otherwise at any price. Such Bonds may be held, resold or
reissued, or, at the option of the Issuer, surrendered to any Paying and Conversion Agent for cancellation.


-----

(e) Cancellation
All Bonds which are redeemed or in respect of which Conversion Rights are exercised will be cancelled and
may not be reissued or resold. Bonds purchased by the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may be surrendered for
cancellation or may be held, reissued or resold.

7. Payments
(a) Method of Payment
Payment of the principal of the Bonds or the net proceeds of sale of Ordinary Shares (together with the
Redemption Price (if applicable) or the Cash Alternative Amount (if applicable)) pursuant to Condition 5(k) will
be made against presentation and surrender (or, in the case of partial payment, endorsement) of Bonds and
payment of any interest due on an Interest Payment Date will be made against presentation and surrender (or, in
the case of partial payment, endorsement) of Coupons, in each case at the specified office of any Paying and
Conversion Agent (subject to Condition 7(b) below) by pounds sterling cheque drawn on a bank in London or, at
the option of the relevant holder, by transfer to a pounds sterling account maintained with a bank in London.
Payments of interest due in respect of Bonds other than on an Interest Payment Date shall be made only against
presentation and either surrender or endorsement (as appropriate) of the relevant Bond.

Payments of all other amounts will be made as provided in these Conditions.

(b) Payments subject to fiscal laws
All payments are subject in all cases to any applicable fiscal or other laws and regulations. No commissions
or expenses shall be charged to the Bondholders or Couponholders in respect of such payments.

(c) Surrender of unmatured Coupons
Each Bond should be presented for redemption together with all unmatured Coupons relating to it, failing
which the amount of any such missing unmatured Coupon (or, in the case of payment not being made in full, that
proportion of the amount of such missing unmatured Coupon which the principal amount so paid bears to the
total principal amount due) will be deducted from the sum due for payment. Each amount so deducted will be
paid in the manner mentioned above against surrender of the relevant missing Coupon not later than 10 years
after the Relevant Date for the relevant payment of the principal amount.

For the purposes hereof and save as otherwise provided herein, unmatured Coupons means Coupons
maturing after the due date for redemption of the Bonds to which they appertain (or, as the case may be, maturing
on or after the Conversion Date in respect of an exercise of Conversion Rights in respect of the Bonds to which
they appertain).

(d) Non-business days
If the due date for payment of the principal or interest in respect of any Bond or Coupon (or any later date on
which a Bond or Coupon is presented for payment) is not at any place of presentation a business day and, in the
case of payment by transfer to a pounds sterling account as referred to above, a business day in London then
the holder will not be entitled to payment at such place of the amount due until the next day which is a business
day at such place and, in the case of payment by transfer to a pounds sterling account, a business day in London,
and the holder will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment in respect of any such delay.

(e) Paying and Conversion Agents, etc.
The initial Paying and Conversion Agents and their initial specified offices are listed below. The Issuer
reserves the right under the Agency Agreement at any time, with the prior written approval of the Trustee (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), to vary or terminate the appointment of any Paying and Conversion
Agent and appoint additional or other Paying and Conversion Agents, provided that it will maintain: (i) a
Principal Paying and Conversion Agent; and (ii) so long as the Bonds are admitted to the Official List of the UK
Listing Authority and admitted to trading by the London Stock Exchange and the rules of the UK Listing
Authority or the London Stock Exchange so require, a Paying and Conversion Agent having a specified office in
London. Notice of any change in the Paying and Conversion Agents or their specified offices will promptly be
given to the Bondholders in accordance with Condition 17.

(f) Fractions

When making payments to Bondholders, fractions of £0.01 will be rounded down to the nearest whole
multiple of £0.01.


-----

8. Taxation

All payments by or on behalf of the Issuer in respect of the Bonds and the Coupons shall be made without
withholding or deduction for any taxation unless such withholding or deduction is required by law. In that event
the relevant payment will be made subject to such withholding or deduction and the Issuer will not be required to
pay any additional or further amounts in respect of such withholding or deduction.

9. Events of Default

If any of the following events occurs, the Trustee may at its absolute discretion, and shall, if so requested in
writing by the holders of not less than one-quarter in principal amount of the Bonds then outstanding or if so
directed by an Extraordinary Resolution of the Bondholders, subject in each case to being indemnified to its
satisfaction, give written notice to the Issuer that the Bonds are due and payable immediately, at their principal
amount as of the date such notice is given together with accrued interest:

(a) the Issuer fails to pay all or any part of the principal or interest due in respect of the Bonds within
10 business days in London of the due date; or

(b) the Issuer defaults in performance or observance of or compliance with any of its other undertakings
set out in the Bonds or the Trust Deed (other than its undertakings under Conditions 10(b) and 10(e))
(which default is in the opinion of the Trustee incapable of remedy or, if in the opinion of the Trustee
capable of remedy, is not in the opinion of the Trustee remedied within 60 days (or such longer period
as the Trustee may permit) after written notice requiring remedy of such default shall have been given
to the Issuer by the Trustee); or

(c) (i) any other present or future indebtedness in respect of moneys borrowed or raised of any one or
more of the Issuer and the Principal Subsidiaries becomes due and payable prematurely by reason
of an event of default (however described); or

(ii) any such indebtedness is not paid when due or (as the case may be) within any originally
applicable grace period therefor; or

(iii) any one or more of the Issuer and the Principal Subsidiaries fails to pay when due or (as the case
may be) within any originally applicable grace period therefor any amount payable by it under any
present or future guarantee or indemnity for any indebtedness in respect of moneys borrowed or
raised; or

(iv) any mortgage, charge, pledge, lien or other encumbrance (each a Security Interest) present
or future created or assumed by any one or more of the Issuer and the Principal Subsidiaries
becomes enforceable,

save in any such case where there is a bona fide dispute as to whether the relevant indebtedness or
amount claimed under any such guarantee or indemnity is due and payable and provided that no such
event shall constitute an Event of Default unless the indebtedness, guarantee, indemnity or amount
secured by the Security Interest either alone or when aggregated with other indebtedness, guarantees,
indemnities or amounts secured by Security Interests falling within sub-paragraphs (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv)
above (other than any guarantees, indemnities and Security Interests relating to indebtedness falling
within sub-paragraphs (i) or (ii) above, any Security Interests relating to guarantees or indemnities
falling within sub-paragraph (iii) above and any indebtedness falling within sub-paragraph (ii) above
which also falls within sub-paragraph (i) above) shall comprise or be in respect of an aggregate amount
equal to the higher of £25,000,000 (or its equivalent in any other currency) and an amount equal to
one per cent. of Tangible Net Worth (as defined in the Trust Deed) (or its equivalent in any other
currency) and for the purpose of this paragraph (c) indebtedness shall exclude Project Finance
Indebtedness and Security Interest shall exclude any mortgage, charge, pledge, lien or other
encumbrance given or assumed solely in relation to Project Finance Indebtedness; or

(d) a distress or execution or other similar proceeding is levied or enforced or sued out upon or against the
whole or a substantial part of the undertaking or assets of the Issuer or any Principal Subsidiary and is
not discharged or stayed within 75 days (or such longer period as the Trustee may approve) of having
been so levied, enforced or sued out; or

(e) the Issuer or any Principal Subsidiary is unable to pay its debts as they fall due or an administrative or
other receiver or administrator or similar officer is appointed over the whole or a substantial part of its
undertaking or assets or it makes or enters into an assignment or an arrangement or composition with or
for the benefit of its creditors generally (or any class of its creditors) or (except, in any case, for the


-----

purposes of a reorganisation, reconstruction, union, transfer, merger or amalgamation effected with
the prior written consent of the Trustee or, in the case of a Principal Subsidiary, in connection with the
transfer of all or substantially all of its business, undertaking and assets to the Issuer or another
Subsidiary of the Issuer) ceases to carry on the whole or substantially the whole of its business provided
that a disposal for full value by the Issuer or any Principal Subsidiary of the whole or any part of
the share capital of a Subsidiary of the Issuer shall be deemed not to be a cessation for the purposes of
this paragraph (e); or

(f) an order is made or an effective resolution is passed for the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer or
any Principal Subsidiary (except, in any case, for the purposes of a reorganisation, reconstruction,
union, transfer, merger or amalgamation effected with the prior written consent of the Trustee or, in the
case of a voluntary solvent winding up of a Principal Subsidiary, in connection with the transfer of all
or substantially all of its business, undertaking and assets to the Issuer or another Subsidiary of the
Issuer); or

(g) the Issuer fails to comply with its obligations under Conditions 10(b) and 10(e);

Provided that, no such event as is mentioned in paragraphs (b) to (e) (inclusive) above shall be an Event of
Default unless the Trustee shall have certified that, in its opinion, such event is materially prejudicial to the
interests of the Bondholders and provided further that no such event as is mentioned in paragraphs (c) to (f)
(inclusive) in relation to a Principal Subsidiary shall be an Event of Default or shall be taken into account in
determining whether an Event of Default has occurred under paragraph (c) if such event also constitutes a
Security Event or at any time after a Security Event in relation to such Principal Subsidiary has occurred.

10. Grant of Security or Redemption to avoid Events of Default

(a) If the Issuer certifies to the Trustee that an event or act which constitues a Security Event but does not
also constitute a Condition 9 Event (a Non-default Security Event) has occurred in relation to a
Principal Subsidiary:

(i) the Issuer may, if an Independent Financial Adviser certifies that the Non-default Security Event
is, in its opinion, materially prejudicial to the interests of the Bondholders, redeem all, but not
some only, of the Bonds at their principal amount together with interest accrued to but excluding
the date of redemption, having given not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice to the
Bondholders in accordance with Condition 17 (which notice shall be irrevocable); or

(ii) the Issuer or any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries may grant in respect of all, but not some only, of the
Bonds and Coupons then outstanding Cash Collateral and/or Non-cash Collateral in accordance
with paragraph (c) below.

(b) If either:

(i) at a time when no previous Security Event in relation to the relevant Principal Subsidiary has
occurred, an event or act occurs in relation to a Prinicpal Subsidiary which constitutes a Security
Event and also constitutes a Condition 9 Event (a Default Security Event); or

(ii) at a time when a previous Security Event in relation to the relevant Principal Subsidiary
has occurred, an event or act occurs in relation to a Principal Subsidiary which constitutes a
Condition 9 Event (a Subsequent Event); and

(iii) either no Cash Collateral and/or Non-cash Collateral has been granted in respect of all the Bonds
and Coupons pursuant to Condition 10(a)(ii) above or this Condition 10(b), in each case in
accordance with Condition 10(c) below, or such Cash Collateral and/or Non-cash Collateral,
having been so granted, has been withdrawn pursuant to Condition 10(f) below; and

(iv) the Trustee certifies that the Default Security Event or the Subsequent Event (as the case may be)
is materially prejudicial to the interests of the Bondholders,

the Issuer may redeem all, but not some only, of the Bonds at their principal amount together with
interest accrued to but excluding the date of redemption, having given not less than 20 days’ notice to
the Bondholders in accordance with Condition 17 (which notice shall be irrevocable), and, unless the
Issuer shall have given such a notice to expire not later than 50 days after the date of such certificate,
the Issuer or any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries shall grant in respect of all, but not some only, of the
Bonds and Coupons then outstanding Cash Collateral and/or Non-cash Collateral in accordance with
Condition 10(c) below not later than 50 days after the date of such certificate.


-----

(c) The aggregate Relevant Value on the Collateral Date of the Cash Collateral and/or Non-cash Collateral
granted pursuant to Condition 10(a)(ii) above or Condition 10(b) above shall be detemined by an
Independent Financial Adviser and shall not be less than 100 per cent., in the case of Cash Collateral, or
110 per cent., in the case of Non-cash Collateral, of the principal amount of the Bonds then outstanding
plus a full year’s gross interest on such Bonds, and so in proportion if both Cash Collateral and
Non-cash Collateral are granted.

(d) The fact that Cash Collateral and/or Non-cash Collateral has been granted pursuant to
Condition 10(a)(ii) above or Condition 10(b) above or that certification has been made by an
Independent Financial Adviser pursuant to Condition 10(a)(i) above shall be notified by the Issuer to
the Bondholders as soon as practicable thereafter in accordance with Condition 17.

(e) So long as any Bond or Coupon remains outstanding in respect of which Non-cash Collateral has been
granted and has not been withdrawn pursuant to Condition 10(f) below the Issuer shall procure that
the aggregate Relevant Value of the Non-cash Collateral shall be determined every six months after the
Collateral Date by an Independent Financial Adviser, the determination of such Independent Financial
Adviser being final and binding and:

(i) if the aggregate Relevant Value of the Non-cash Collateral as shown by such determination
shall be less than 110 per cent. of the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds (at the date of such
relevant determination) then outstanding plus a full year’s gross interest, or the relevant proportion
thereof, accrued to the date of such determination, the Issuer or any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries
shall make good such deficiency within 14 business days in London thereafter by granting further
Cash Collateral and/or Non-cash Collateral, the aggregate Relevant Value of which at the date of
the determination (or such later date as the Issuer and the Trustee may agree) is not less than the
amount of such deficiency or the relevant proportion thereof; or

(ii) if the aggregate Relevant Value of the Non-cash Collateral as shown by such determination
shall be more than 110 per cent. of the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds then outstanding
plus a full year’s gross interest, or the relevant proportion thereof, the Issuer or any of the Issuer’s
Subsidiaries may withdraw any part of the Cash Collateral and/or Non-cash Collateral the
aggregate Relevant Value of which at the date of such determination (or such later date as
the Issuer and the Trustee may agree) is not more than the amount of such excess or the relevant
proportion thereof.

(f) The Issuer or any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries may at any time (except after the occurrence of a
Subsequent Event) withdraw all, but not some only, of the Cash Collateral and/or Non-cash Collateral
granted pursuant to Condition 10(a)(ii) above. The Issuer or any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries may also at
any time after the occurrence of a Subsequent Event (in the case of Cash Collateral and/or Non-cash
Collateral granted pursuant to Condition 10(a)(ii) above) or at any time (in the case of Cash Collateral
and/or Non-cash Collateral granted pursuant to Condition 10(b) above) withdraw all, but not some
only, of the Cash Collateral and/or Non-cash Collateral granted pursuant to Condition 10(a)(ii) or
Condition 10(b) above upon the Trustee being satisfied, having received the advice of an Independent
Financial Adviser, that either (i) the relevant Default Security Event or Subsequent Event is not or is no
longer (as the case may be) materially prejudicial to the interests of the Bondholders or (ii) the relevant
Default Security Event or Subsequent Event no longer exists and the financial position of the Issuer is
no worse than that existing immediately prior to the occurrence of the relevant Default Security Event
or Subsequent Event. Any such withdrawal pursuant to this Condition 10(f) shall be notified by the
Issuer to the Bondholders as soon as practicable thereafter in accordance with Condition 17. In this
Condition 10(f), any reference to Cash Collateral and/or Non-cash Collateral granted pursuant
to Condition 10(a)(ii) or Condition 10(b) above respectively includes any additional or substituted
Cash Collateral and/or Non-cash Collateral granted pursuant to Condition 10(e) above or (g) below.

(g) The Issuer or any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries (without prejudice to their rights under Condition 10(f)
above) may at any time withdraw all or any part of the Cash Collateral and/or Non-cash Collateral
granted pursuant to Condition 10(a)(ii) above or Condition 10(b) or Condition 10(e) above or this
Condition 10(g) upon: (i) the Issuer or any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries granting further Cash Collateral
and/or Non-cash Collateral; and (ii) an Independent Financial Adviser certifying that the aggregate
Relevant Value of the Cash Collateral and/or Non-cash Collateral in respect of the Bonds and Coupons
after such withdrawal and further grant will not be less than 100 per cent., in the case of Cash
Collateral, or 110 per cent., in the case of Non-cash Collateral, of the principal amount of the Bonds


-----

then outstanding, and so in proportion if both Cash Collateral and Non-cash Collateral have been
granted.

(h) All rights of withdrawal under Condition 10(f) and Condition 10(g) above shall cease upon the Bonds
becoming immediately due and repayable pursuant to Condition 9.

(i) The Trust Deed provides that the Trustee is under no obligation to ascertain whether a Security Event,
Non-default Security Event, Default Security Event, Subsequent Event or a Condition 9 Event has
occurred and, until it shall have actual knowledge or express notice pursuant to the Trust Deed to the
contrary, the Trustee may assume that no such event has occurred.

11. Undertakings

(a) The Issuer shall:

(i) procure that a resolution to disapply pre-emption rights of Shareholders under Section 89 of the
Companies Act 1985 in respect of a sufficient amount of equity securities for the Issuer to be able
to satisfy Conversion Rights in full by the delivery of Ordinary Shares is put to Shareholders at the
first annual general meeting of the Issuer held after 16th July, 2003 and at each successive annual
general meeting thereafter until such a resolution is passed; and

(ii) give notice to Bondholders and the Trustee as soon as is practicable following the passing of such
a resolution to increase the Conversion Amount and reduce the Cash Settled Amount to the extent
permissible by such resolution and applicable laws.

(b) Whilst any Conversion Right remains exercisable, the Issuer will, save with the approval of an
Extraordinary Resolution or with the prior written approval of the Trustee where, in its opinion, it is not
materially prejudicial to the interests of the Bondholders to give such approval:

(i) issue, allot and deliver Ordinary Shares on exercise of Conversion Rights in accordance with these
Conditions and at all times keep available for issue free from pre-emptive or other similar rights
out of its authorised but unissued share capital such number of Ordinary Shares as would enable
the Conversion Rights and all other rights of subscription and exchange for and conversion into
Ordinary Shares to be satisfied in full;

(ii) not issue or pay up any securities, in either case by way of capitalisation of profits or reserves,
other than:

(A) by the issue of fully paid Ordinary Shares or other securities to the Shareholders and other
holders of shares in the capital of the Issuer which by their terms entitle the holders thereof to
receive Ordinary Shares or other securities on a capitalisation of profits or reserves; or

(B) by the issue of Ordinary Shares paid up in full out of profits or reserves (in accordance with
applicable law) and issued wholly, ignoring fractional entitlements, in lieu of the whole or
part of a cash dividend; or

(C) by the issue of fully paid equity share capital (other than Ordinary Shares) to the holders of
equity share capital of the same class and other holders of shares in the capital of the Issuer
which by their terms entitle the holders thereof to receive equity share capital (other than
Ordinary Shares) on a capitalisation of profits or reserves;

unless, in any such case, the same gives rise (or would, but for the provisions of Condition 5(g)
relating to the carry forward of adjustments, give rise) to an adjustment to the Conversion Price;

(iii) not in any way modify the rights attaching to the Ordinary Shares with respect to voting, dividends
or liquidation nor issue any other class of equity share capital carrying any rights which are more
favourable than such rights but so that nothing in this Condition 11(iii) shall prevent:

(A) the issue of any equity share capital to employees (including directors holding or formerly
holding executive office or the personal service company of any such person) whether of the
Issuer or any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries or associated companies by virtue of their office or
employment pursuant to any scheme or plan approved by the Issuer in[-] general meeting or
which is established pursuant to such a scheme or plan which is or has been so approved; or

(B) any consolidation or subdivision of the Ordinary Shares or the conversion of any Ordinary
Shares into stock or vice versa; or


-----

(C) any modification of such rights which is not, in the opinion of an Independent Financial
Adviser, materially prejudicial to the interests of Bondholders; or

(D) any alteration to the Articles of Association of the Issuer made in connection with the matters
described in this Condition 11 or which is supplemental or incidental to any of the foregoing
(including any amendment made to enable or facilitate procedures relating to such matters
and any amendment dealing with the rights and obligations of holders of securities, including
Ordinary Shares, dealt with under such procedures); or

(E) any issue of equity share capital where the issue of such equity share capital results or would,
but for the provisions of any other Condition, otherwise result in an adjustment of the
Conversion Price; or

(F) any issue of equity share capital or modification of rights attaching to the Ordinary Shares
where prior thereto the Issuer shall have instructed an Independent Financial Adviser to
determine what (if any) adjustments should be made to the Conversion Price as being fair and
reasonable to take account thereof and such investment bank or bank shall have determined
either that no adjustment is required or that an adjustment to the Conversion Price is required
and, if so, the new Conversion Price as a result thereof and the basis upon which such
adjustment is to be made and, in any such case, the date on which the adjustment shall take
effect (and so that the adjustment shall be made and shall take effect accordingly);

(iv) procure that no securities (whether issued by the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer or procured
by the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer to be issued) issued without rights to convert into, or
exchange or subscribe for, Ordinary Shares shall subsequently be granted such rights exercisable
at a consideration per Ordinary Share which is less than 95 per cent. of the Current Market Price
per Ordinary Share at the close of business on the last dealing day preceding the date of the
announcement of the proposed inclusion of such rights unless the same gives rise (or would, but
for the provisions of Condition 5(g) relating to the carry forward of adjustments, give rise) to an
adjustment to the Conversion Price and that at no time shall there be in issue Ordinary Shares of
differing nominal values, save where such Ordinary Shares have the same economic rights;

(v) not make any issue, grant or distribution or take any other action if the effect thereof would be
that, on the conversion of Bonds, Ordinary Shares would (but for the provisions of Condition 5(e))
have to be issued at a discount or otherwise could not, under any applicable law then in effect, be
legally issued as fully paid;

(vi) not reduce its issued share capital, share premium account or capital redemption reserve or any
uncalled liability in respect thereof except: (i) pursuant to the terms of issue of the relevant share
capital; or (ii) by means of a purchase or redemption of share capital of the Issuer; or (iii) as
permitted by Section 130(2) of the Companies Act 1985; or (iv) where the reduction does not
involve any distribution of assets; or (v) where the reduction results in (or would, but for the
provisions of Condition 5(g) relating to the carry forward of adjustments, result in) an adjustment
to the Conversion Price; or (vi) solely in relation to a change in the normal currency in which the
nominal value of the Ordinary Shares is expressed; or (vii) pursuant to a Newco Scheme;

(vii) if any offer is made to all (or as nearly as may be practicable all) Shareholders (or all (or as nearly
as may be practicable all) such Shareholders other than the offeror and/or any associates of the
offeror (as defined in Section 430E(4) of the Companies Act 1985 or any modification or reenactment thereof)) to acquire all or a majority of the issued ordinary share capital of the Issuer, or
if a scheme (other than a Newco Scheme) is proposed with regard to such acquisition, give notice
of such offer or scheme to the Trustee and the Bondholders at the same time as any notice thereof
is sent to its Shareholders (or as soon as practicable thereafter) that details concerning such offer or
scheme may be obtained from the specified offices of the Paying and Conversion Agents and,
where such an offer or scheme has been recommended by the Board of Directors of the Issuer, or
where such an offer has become or been declared unconditional in all respects, use its reasonable
endeavours to procure that a like offer or scheme is extended to the holders of any Ordinary Shares
issued during the period of the offer or scheme arising out of the exercise of the Conversion Rights
and/or to the holders of the Bonds; and

(viii) use its reasonable endeavours to ensure that the Ordinary Shares issued upon conversion of the
Bonds or upon redemption of the Bonds will be admitted to the Official List of the UK Listing
Authority and admitted to trading by the London Stock Exchange in accordance with their


-----

respective rules and will be listed, quoted or dealt in on any other stock exchange or securities
market on which the Ordinary Shares may then be listed or quoted or dealt in.

As used in these Conditions, ordinary share capital has the meaning given to it in Section 832 of the
Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 and equity share capital has the meaning given to it in
Section 744 of the Companies Act 1985.

12. Prescription

Claims in respect of principal and interest on Bonds will become void unless presentation for payment is
made as required by Condition 7 within a period of 10 years in the case of principal and five years in the case of
interest from the appropriate Relevant Date.

13. Replacement of Bonds and Coupons

If any Bond or Coupon is lost, stolen, mutilated, defaced or destroyed it may be replaced at the specified
office of the Paying and Conversion Agent in London for the time being subject to all applicable laws and stock
exchange requirements, upon payment by the claimant of the expenses incurred in connection with such
replacement and on such terms as to evidence, security, indemnity and otherwise as the Issuer may require.
Mutilated or defaced Bonds or Coupons must be surrendered before replacements will be issued.

14. Meetings of Bondholders, Modification and Waiver

(a) Meetings of Bondholders

The Trust Deed contains provisions for convening meetings of Bondholders to consider any matter affecting
their interests, including the sanctioning by Extraordinary Resolution of a modification of any of these Conditions
or any provisions of the Trust Deed. Such a meeting may be convened by Bondholders holding not less than
10 per cent. in principal amount of the Bonds for the time being outstanding. The quorum for any meeting
convened to consider an Extraordinary Resolution will be one or more persons present holding or representing a
clear majority in principal amount of the Bonds for the time being outstanding, or at any adjourned meeting one
or more persons present being or representing Bondholders whatever the principal amount of the Bonds held or
represented, unless the business of such meeting includes consideration of proposals, inter alia: (i) to modify the
maturity of the Bonds or the dates on which interest is payable in respect of the Bonds; (ii) to reduce or cancel the
principal amount of, or interest on, the Bonds or to vary the method of calculating the rate of interest on, the
Bonds; (iii) to change the currency of payment of the Bonds; (iv) to modify or vary the Conversion Rights in
-respect of the Bonds; or (v) to modify the provisions concerning the quorum required at any meeting of
Bondholders or the majority required to pass an Extraordinary Resolution, in which case the necessary quorum
will be one or more persons holding or representing not less than two thirds, or at any adjourned meeting not less
than one quarter, in principal amount of the Bonds for the time being outstanding. Any Extraordinary Resolution
duly passed shall be binding on Bondholders (whether or not they were present at the meeting at which such
resolution was passed) and on all Couponholders.

(b) Modification and Waiver

The Trustee may agree, without the consent of the Bondholders or Couponholders, to: (i) any modification
of any of the provisions of the Trust Deed, any trust deed supplemental to the Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement,
any agreement supplemental to the Agency Agreement, the Bonds or the Coupons which in the Trustee’s opinion
is of a formal, minor or technical nature or is made to correct a manifest or proven error; and (ii) any other
modification to the Trust Deed, any trust deed supplemental to the Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement, any
agreement supplemental to the Agency Agreement, the Bonds or the Coupons, and any waiver or authorisation of
any breach or proposed breach, of any of the provisions of the Trust Deed, any trust deed supplemental to the
Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement, any agreement supplemental to the Agency Agreement, the Bonds or
Coupons which is, in the opinion of the Trustee, not materially prejudicial to the interests of the Bondholders.
The Trustee may, without any such consent as aforesaid, determine that any Event of Default shall not be treated
as such provided that the Trustee is of the opinion that to do so will not be materially prejudicial to the interests of
the Bondholders.

Any such modification, authorisation, waiver or determination shall be binding on the Bondholders and the
Couponholders and, if the Trustee so requires, such modification shall be notified to the Bondholders and the
Couponholders as soon as practicable in accordance with Condition 17.


-----

(c) Substitution

The Trust Deed contains provisions which permit the Trustee, without the consent of the Bondholders or the
Couponholders to agree with the Issuer (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld) to the substitution in
place of the Issuer (or of any previous substitute under this Condition) as the principal debtor under the Bonds
and the Trust Deed of another company, subject to: (i) the Bonds being unconditionally and irrevocably
guaranteed by the Issuer; (ii) the Trustee being satisfied that so to do would not be materially prejudicial to the
interests of the Bondholders, and (iii) certain other conditions set out in the Trust Deed being complied with.

(d) Entitlement of the Trustee

In connection with the exercise of its functions (including but not limited to those referred to in this
Condition) the Trustee shall have regard to the interests of the Bondholders as a class and shall not have regard to
the consequences of such exercise for individual Bondholders or Couponholders and the Trustee shall not be
entitled to require from the Issuer, nor shall any Bondholder or Couponholder be entitled to claim, from the
Trustee or the Issuer any indemnification or payment in respect of any tax consequence of any such exercise upon
individual Bondholders or Couponholders.

15. Enforcement

At any time after the Bonds become due and repayable, the Trustee may, at its discretion and without notice,
take such proceedings against the Issuer as it may think fit to enforce the provisions of the Trust Deed, the Bonds
and the Coupons, but it shall not be bound to take any such proceedings or any other action in relation to the Trust
Deed, the Bonds or the Coupons unless: (i) it shall have been so directed by an Extraordinary Resolution of the
Bondholders or so requested in writing by the holders of at least one-quarter in principal amount of the Bonds
then outstanding; and (ii) it shall have been indemnified to its satisfaction.

No Bondholder or Couponholder shall be entitled to proceed directly against the Issuer unless the Trustee,
having become bound so to proceed, fails so to do within a reasonable period and the failure shall be continuing.

16. The Trustee

The Trust Deed contains provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee and for its relief from
responsibility, including relieving it from taking proceedings unless indemnified to its satisfaction. The Trustee is
entitled to enter into business transactions with the Issuer and any entity related to the Issuer without accounting
for any profit.

The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on a certificate or report from the Auditors whether or not called for by
or addressed to the Trustee and whether or not any such certificate or report or engagement letter or other
document entered into by the Trustee and the Auditors in connection therewith contains any limit on the liability
of the Auditors.

17. Notices

Notices to the Bondholders shall be valid if published in a daily newspaper of general circulation in London
(which is expected to be the Financial Times). If in the opinion of the Trustee any such publication is not
practicable, notice shall be validly given if published in another leading daily English language newspaper with
general circulation in Europe. Any such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication
or, if published more than once or on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made, as provided
above.

Couponholders shall be deemed for all purposes to have notice of the contents of any notice given to the
Bondholders in accordance with this Condition.

18. Further Issues

The Issuer may from time to time without the consent of the Bondholders create and issue further notes,
bonds or debentures either having the same terms and conditions in all respects as the outstanding notes, bonds or
debentures of any series (including the Bonds) (or in all respects except for the first payment of interest on them)
and so that such further issue shall be consolidated and form a single series with the outstanding notes, bonds or
debentures of any series (including the Bonds) or upon such terms as to interest, conversion, premium,
redemption and otherwise as the Issuer may determine at the time of their issue. Any further notes, bonds or
debentures forming a single series with the outstanding notes, bonds or debentures of any series (including the
Bonds) constituted by the Trust Deed or any deed supplemental to it shall, and any other notes, bonds or


-----

debentures may, with the consent of the Trustee, be constituted by a deed supplemental to the Trust Deed. The
Trust Deed contains provisions for convening a single meeting of the Bondholders and the holders of notes, bonds
or debentures of other series in certain circumstances where the Trustee so decides.

19. Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999

No person shall have any right to enforce any term or condition of the Bonds under the Contracts (Rights of
Third Parties) Act 1999.

20. Governing Law

The Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement, the Bonds and the Coupons are governed by, and shall be construed
in accordance with, English law.


-----

SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE BONDS IN GLOBAL FORM

The Global Bonds will contain provisions which apply to the Bonds while they are in global form, some of
which will modify the effect of the terms and conditions of the Bonds set out in this document. The following is a
summary of certain of those provisions.

1. Exchange

The Temporary Global Bond is exchangeable in whole or in part for interests in the Permanent Global Bond
on or after a date which is expected to be 26th August, 2003 upon certification as to non-U.S. beneficial
ownership in the form set out in the Temporary Global Bond. The Permanent Global Bond is exchangeable in
whole but not in part (free of charge to the holder) for definitive Bonds (i) if the Permanent Global Bond is held
by or on behalf of one or more clearing systems and all such clearing systems are closed for business for a
continuous period of 14 days (other than by reason of holidays, statutory or otherwise) or announce an intention
permanently to cease business or do in fact do so and no alternative or successor clearing system acceptable to the
Trustee is available or (ii) if principal in respect of all the outstanding Bonds is not paid when due and payable or
(iii) if the Issuer would suffer a material disadvantage in respect of the Bonds as a result of a change in the laws or
regulations (taxation or otherwise) of any jurisdiction which would not be suffered were the Bonds in definitive
form and a certificate to such effect signed by two Directors of the Issuer is delivered to the Trustee for display to
Bondholders. Thereupon (in the case of (i) and (ii) above) the holder may give notice to the Trustee, and (in
the case of (iii) above) the Issuer may give notice to the Trustee and the Bondholders, of its intention to exchange
the Permanent Global Bond for definitive Bonds on or after the Exchange Date (as defined below) specified in the
relevant notice.

On or after the Exchange Date the holder of the Permanent Global Bond may surrender the Permanent
Global Bond to or to the order of the Principal Paying and Conversion Agent. In exchange for the Permanent
Global Bond, the Issuer will deliver, or procure the delivery of, an equal aggregate principal amount of duly
executed and authenticated definitive Bonds (having attached to them all Coupons in respect of interest which has
not already been paid on the Permanent Global Bond), security printed in accordance with any applicable legal
and stock exchange requirements and in or substantially in the form set out in Schedule 1 to the Trust Deed. On
exchange of the Permanent Global Bond, the Issuer will procure that it is cancelled and returned to the holder
together with any relevant definitive Bonds.

Exchange Date means a day falling not less than 60 days after that on which the notice requiring exchange
is given and on which banks are open for business in the city in which the specified office of the Principal Paying
and Conversion Agent is located and, except in the case of exchange pursuant to (i) above, in the city or cities in
which the relevant clearing systems are located.

2. Payments

Payments of principal and interest in respect of Bonds represented by the Permanent Global Bond will be
made against presentation and endorsement and, if no further payment falls to be made in respect of the Bonds,
surrender of the Permanent Global Bond to or to the order of the Principal Paying and Conversion Agent or such
other Paying and Conversion Agent as shall have been notified to the Bondholders for such purpose. A record of
each payment so made will be endorsed on the appropriate schedule to the Permanent Global Bond, which
endorsement will be prima facie evidence that such payment has been made in respect of the Bonds. Payments of
principal and interest on the Bonds represented by the Permanent Global Bond will be made by crediting the
accounts of Accountholders (as defined below) with the relevant clearing systems. Payments by Accountholders
with the relevant clearing systems to the holder of a beneficial interest in the Bonds will be the responsibility of
the Accountholders. Neither the Trustee nor any Agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of
the records of the relevant clearing system relating to payments made by the relevant clearing system in respect
of beneficial interests in the Bonds or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records of the relevant
clearing system relating to such Accountholders.

Accountholder means a person who is for the time being shown in the records of Euroclear or Clearstream,
Luxembourg (other than Clearstream, Luxembourg, if Clearstream, Luxembourg shall be an accountholder of
Euroclear, and Euroclear, if Euroclear shall be an accountholder of Clearstream, Luxembourg) as the holder of a
particular principal amount of Bonds and in which regard any certificate or other document issued by Euroclear
or Clearstream, Luxembourg as to the principal amount of Bonds standing to the account of any person shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes.


-----

3. Notices

So long as the Bonds are represented by the Permanent Global Bond and the Permanent Global Bond is held
on behalf of a clearing system, notices to Bondholders may be given by delivery of the relevant notice to that
clearing system for communication by it to entitled Accountholders in substitution for publication as required by
the Conditions.

4. Prescription

Claims against the Issuer in respect of principal and interest on the Bonds while the Bonds are represented
by the Permanent Global Bond will become void unless it is presented for payment within a period of 10 years (in
the case of principal) and five years (in the case of interest) from the appropriate Relevant Date.

5. Trustee’s Powers

In considering the interests of Bondholders while the Permanent Global Bond is held on behalf of a clearing
system the Trustee may have regard to any information provided to it by such clearing system or its operator or a
participant in such system as to the identity (either individually or by category) of its Accountholders with
entitlements to the Permanent Global Bond (or an interest in respect thereof) and may consider such interests as if
such Accountholders were the holder of the Permanent Global Bond.

6. Conversion Rights

For so long as all of the Bonds are represented by one or both of the Global Bonds and such Global Bond(s)
is/are held on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, an Accountholder wishing to exercise
Conversion Rights in respect of any such Bond(s) shall not be required to deposit the relevant Bond(s) with the
Paying and Conversion Agent to whom the relevant Conversion Notice is delivered and references in Condition 5
to the person delivering a Bond for conversion shall be deemed to be references to the person delivering a
Conversion Notice. On the Conversion Date in respect of such Bond(s) the Paying and Conversion Agent to
whom the relevant Conversion Notice is delivered shall, on behalf of the relevant Accountholder, obtain
confirmation from Euroclear and/or, as the case may be, Clearstream, Luxembourg that the Accountholder is
shown in its records as the holder of at least the principal amount of Bonds in respect of which the Conversion
Notice has been delivered. Whilst the Bonds are represented by one or both of the Global Bonds and the Global
Bond(s) is/are held on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, Conversion Notices shall be given in
accordance with the standard procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg (which may include
notice being given on the instruction of the relevant Accountholder by Euroclear and/or, as the case may be,
Clearstream, Luxembourg or any common depositary therefor to the Principal Paying and Conversion Agent by
electronic means) in a form acceptable to Euroclear and/or, as the case may be, Clearstream, Luxembourg.


-----

USE OF PROCEEDS

The estimated net cash proceeds to be raised in connection with the issue of the Bonds, after the expenses of
the issue, will amount to approximately £250,000,000. The net cash proceeds will be used by the Issuer to further
strengthen its balance sheet and increase its financial flexibility.

DESCRIPTION OF CABLE & WIRELESS

CORPORATE OVERVIEW

The telecommunications industry is currently facing unfavourable market conditions, including, amongst
others, a decline in investment in the industry, a decline in demand for certain telecommunications products and
services, pricing pressures and over-capacity. These conditions have contributed to a general, and often
significant, decline in share prices for telecommunications companies, including Cable & Wireless, which has
seen its share price decline by 154p from 223p at 31st March, 2002 to 69p at 31st March, 2003. These market
conditions have also precipitated restructurings and bankruptcy and insolvency filings by several
telecommunications companies.

The last year was a turbulent one for Cable & Wireless. The Company started the year optimistic that its
diversification into data highways, hosting and internet services (collectively called Global) would position it
well for a prosperous future. A deterioration in Cable & Wireless Global’s business performance has, however,
resulted in fixed asset and goodwill impairment as forecast performance has been revised downwards. In
September 2002, fixed assets were impaired by £787 million and goodwill of £2,713 million was written off,
principally in the United Kingdom. In November 2002, Cable & Wireless announced the need to restructure its
US operations to reduce the running losses and cashflow drain to which it realised it was exposed. In January
2003, as a consequence of a downgrade by Moody’s of the Company’s long term debt from Baa2 to Ba1, the
Company had to place in escrow £1.5 billion pursuant to a tax indemnity granted to Deutsche Telekom in
connection with the sale of Cable & Wireless’ stake in One2One. After agreement was reached with the Inland
Revenue to settle the Group’s outstanding UK Corporation Tax Affairs for the ten years to 31st March, 2001,
which included the year in which the One2One transaction took place, these funds were released from escrow at
the year end.

On 10th January, 2003, Richard Lapthorne was appointed Chairman of the Company following the
retirement as Chairman of Sir Ralph Robins on the same date. On 21st January, 2003 it was announced that
Graham Wallace, Chief Executive, would be leaving the Company and that Rob Rowley, a Non-executive
Director and Chairman of the Audit Committee would become Executive Deputy Chairman with responsibility
for the finance and legal functions. On 2nd April, 2003, it was announced that Francesco Caio would be
appointed Chief Executive Officer of the Company with effect from 4th April, 2003 in place of Graham Wallace.
Also on 2nd April, 2003, Kevin Loosemore was appointed Chief Operating Officer. New Non-executive
Directors have been appointed in the last six months, notably Bernard Gray, Tony Rice, Graham Howe and
Kasper Rorsted, bringing a range of highly relevant skills from their backgrounds in finance and restructuring,
telecommunications and IT, government and public sector affairs. On 30th June, 2003, it was announced that
Lord Robertson of Port Ellen, Secretary General of NATO, has been appointed as Executive Deputy Chairman
with effect from 1st February, 2004.

The aim of the Company is to deliver sustainable and acceptable returns over time with manageable residual
risk. With this in mind the Company’s management has announced a number of initiatives:

Develop national businesses

The aim of the Group is to create a group of profitable national telecommunications companies with strong
positions in their primary markets where they offer both domestic and international services. The Group already
has the building blocks, and is making strategic changes and restructuring plans which represent the next steps
along the road to achieving this ambition. Consistent with the new national approach, Cable & Wireless will no
longer be divided into the Global and Regional business divisions, instead it will be organised on a geographic
basis.

Restructure the UK business

Cable & Wireless is second only to BT in the United Kingdom, which is one of world’s largest
telecommunications markets. However, performance has declined and, as a result, the business is being
restructured to drive efficiency, improve network services and focus the Company on building market share with
target customers. The plans include a reduction in headcount of 1,500. As a consequence of eliminating Cable &
Wireless Global, and focusing clearly on the national businesses, Royston Hoggarth has been appointed as Chief
Executive of Cable & Wireless UK.


-----

Withdraw from US operations

The US subsidiaries make losses, consume cash and require significant management attention. Furthermore
their services have limited interaction with the rest of the Group. These businesses may have value to the right
owner but they are not sustainable with the current cost structure. A wide-ranging cost control programme has
been initiated. The Company intends to withdraw from the US businesses altogether; all options are being
explored. In connection with the consideration of a variety of options, Cable & Wireless’ US subsidiaries have
taken some initial steps.

Rationalise continental Europe and, in due course, improve results in Japan

In continental Europe, the Group provides services to other licensed telecommunications operators and to
multinational corporate customers, some of which are headquartered in the United Kingdom. However, it also
operates a number of businesses, which provide services to smaller corporate customers and act as internet
service providers. Cable & Wireless has either completed or is in advanced discussion on the sale of non-core
businesses across continental Europe in order to reduce exit costs. Cable & Wireless IDC provides international
voice and data services to companies in Japan and South East Asia. Although it operates in a market dominated
by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT), it delivers acceptable results and has good prospects.

Focus on profit before tax and cash

Across the Group the focus will now be on profit before tax and cash. More rigorous cost control and capital
management disciplines have been introduced to ensure that the restructuring plans can be accommodated within
the Group’s existing financial resources.

To support these initiatives, Cable & Wireless has adopted a simpler organisational structure, eliminating
the Global and Regional divisions. Going forward the Group will have a country-based structure, with country
CEO’s responsible for profit and loss, cash flow and balance sheet and reporting directly to the Chief Operating
Officer. This new organisational structure will, the Company expects, result in lower overheads, clear
accountability and more effective transfer of knowledge and skills.

The Group faces a number of challenges in implementing its new strategic initiatives, including those linked
to turmoil in the industry, global economic challenges, as well as the markets in which the Group operates. The
Group, however, remains committed to capitalising on its core skills and key customers, to return it to
profitability. See ‘‘Investment Considerations – Considerations Relating to the Group’s Operations’’ for a further
discussion of certain of the challenges facing the Group.

SUMMARY

Cable & Wireless is an international telecommunications business with annual revenue of £4.4 billion in the
year to 31st March, 2003 and customers in 80 countries. Headquartered in London, Cable & Wireless’ principal
operations are in the United Kingdom; the Caribbean; the United States; Japan; continental Europe; Panama and
Macau. Cable & Wireless provides voice, data and IP services to business and residential customers and
wholesale services to carriers, mobile operators and content, application and internet providers.

History

For over 120 years, Cable & Wireless has provided telecommunications services, networks and equipment
to business and residential customers around the world. Except for some 30 years as a state-owned company after
the Second World War, Cable & Wireless has been a publicly owned limited company since its earliest days.

In the United Kingdom, Cable & Wireless, through Mercury Communications, was an early competitor in
the liberalised telecommunications market. In April 1997, Cable & Wireless Communications plc (CWC) was
formed by the merger of Mercury Communications with Nynex CableComms, Bell Cablemedia and Videotron.

In September 1998, Cable & Wireless acquired MCI Telecommunication Corporation’s internet business in
the United States and world wide. In the Asia-Pacific region, Cable & Wireless acquired International Digital
Communications Inc. (now re-named Cable & Wireless IDC), one of Japan’s international telecommunications
carriers, in June 1999.

In October 1999, Cable & Wireless completed the sale of its interest in One2One, its UK mobile phone
business, to Deutsche Telekom. One2One was a joint venture with MediaOne Group Inc and the joint venture
partners received £6.9 billion in cash.


-----

In May 2000, Cable & Wireless took full ownership of the corporate, business, IP and wholesale operations
of CWC (CWC DataCo), while the consumer telephone, internet and cable TV operations (CWC ConsumerCo)
were acquired by ntl Incorporated. CWC DataCo was integrated with Cable & Wireless’ other similar operations
to form Cable & Wireless Global, which brought together the Group’s operations in the United Kingdom,
continental Europe, the United States and Japan.

At the same time, the Group’s other operations were brought together under Cable & Wireless Regional.

In August 2000, Cable & Wireless disposed of its interest in Cable & Wireless HKT Limited (based in Hong
Kong) to a subsidiary of PCCW Limited. Cable & Wireless received cash and shares in PCCW equivalent to an
interest of approximately 20 per cent. in the enlarged company. PCCW shares were sold in September 2000 for
consideration of approximately £930 million reducing the holding to approximately 14 per cent. In June 2003, the
Company sold the remaining holding in PCCW as part of a market placement for a consideration of
approximately £233 million.

In September 2001, Cable & Wireless disposed of its interest in Cable & Wireless Optus Limited (based in
Australia) to a subsidiary of Singapore Telecommunications Limited (SingTel). Cable & Wireless received cash
and SingTel shares and bonds which were subsequently sold for a total consideration of £2,402 million.

The web services and hosting businesses, Digital Island, Inc. (DI) and selected assets and the majority of
business activities of EXDS, Inc (formerly Exodus Communications, Inc) (Exodus) were acquired in 2002.

Recent acquisitions and disposals

In May 2002, Cable & Wireless purchased Guernsey Telecoms Limited from the States of Guernsey for
consideration of £22.5 million. The Group paid a further £1.3 million for the assignment of the rights that the
States of Guernsey had in a fibre optic cable project which when completed will run from Guernsey to Jersey and
France. On 30th September, 2002, the company was renamed Cable and Wireless Guernsey Ltd. The company is
a full service provider serving the Bailiwick of Guernsey.

In September 2002, the Company sold its US retail voice customer base for an aggregate consideration of
£11 million in cash, payable over approximately two years. This disposal was part of the restructuring of the
Company’s US business, announced in May 2002. The Company also announced the disposal of certain US retail
data customers as part of the same restructuring.

In November 2002, the Company announced that Cable & Wireless would withdraw from domestic business
markets in the United States and in continental Europe except for multinational and wholesale customers. It was
also announced that Cable & Wireless’ established businesses in the United Kingdom and Japan would be
reshaped to reduce costs and produce greater focus on profitability and cash flow.

In December 2002, as part of the Initial Public Offering of shares in the Singapore mobile operator
MobileOne Ltd, Cable & Wireless sold 60 per cent. of its stake in that company, realising a profit of £54 million
before minority interests.

Organisational structure

From mid-2000 Cable & Wireless was organised into two business divisions: Cable & Wireless Global and
Cable & Wireless Regional. Cable & Wireless Global comprised operations in the United Kingdom, the United
States, Japan and continental Europe and concentrated on the provision of services to large and multinational
corporates and other service providers. Cable & Wireless Regional’s operations were in the Caribbean, Panama,
Macau and Rest of World. Rest of World comprises Cable & Wireless Regional’s operations in Yemen, Bahrain
and the Maldives, together with smaller operations in Seychelles, Diego Garcia, Falkland Islands, Ascension, St.
Helena, Guernsey, and Sakhalin in Russia.

From June 2003, the Company is organised with a geographical and customer focus and the Global and
Regional distinction has been eliminated.

Current geographical financial data for Cable & Wireless Global included in this business description are
based on management’s estimates of the allocation of turnover and operating profit or loss attributable to a given
geographical region that was included within the business of Cable & Wireless Global. However, as announced,
Cable & Wireless intends to focus its business around the key geographical regions in which it operates and will
track and report results on that basis. Consequently, in the future, the geographical breakdown of the Group’s
results for those portions of its business that used to be part of Cable & Wireless Global may not be entirely
comparable to the results by geography disclosed when Cable & Wireless reported results by Cable & Wireless

Capital Expenditure

Capital expenditure on plant, equipment and property totalled £0.8 billion in 2003 compared with £1.9
billion in 2002 and £3.4 billion in 2001. This capital expenditure was funded from the Group’s general cash
resources. Of the capital expenditure spent in 2001, 30 per cent. related to the United Kingdom and 70 per cent.
related to the rest of the world; of the capital expenditure spent in 2002, 35 per cent. related to the United
Kingdom and 65 per cent. related to the rest of the world; and of the capital expenditure spent in 2003, 42 per
cent. related to the United Kingdom and 58 per cent. related to the rest of the world.

Cable & Wireless’ capital expenditure in 2003 included the following third party investments:

s network build, totalling £310 million, mainly relating to international and pan-regional capacity as well
as the UK network;

s the rollout out of a GSM mobile network in the Caribbean and Panama, together with further expansion
of the TDMA mobile network in the Caribbean, totalling £113 million;

s Information Technology (IT), totalling £134 million, including expenditure on billing systems and IT
support for capital projects; and

s network terminating equipment and customer premises equipment totalling £134 million.

The above numbers include working capital allocations.

At 1st April, 2003, Cable & Wireless was committed to £135 million of capital expenditure as set out in
Note 27 to the Financial Statements included elsewhere in this document (the Financial Statements). This
capital expenditure will be funded using the Group’s general cash resources and includes expenditure on building
and rolling-out network, IT provision and the provision of customer contract infrastructure. It is expected that 41
per cent. of this expenditure will relate to the United Kingdom and 59 per cent. to the rest of the world. The
Group is currently reviewing all capital expenditure projects with a view to reducing capital expenditure in 2004
compared with 2003.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

Products and services

Cable & Wireless provides a variety of services including voice, data, IP, mobile and hosting services to its
customers in its various national operations.

Voice

Cable & Wireless offers domestic and international connectivity via switched and dedicated services to
residential, business, corporate and multinational customers. Cable & Wireless also offers leased circuit and
facsimile telecommunications services.

Cable & Wireless is a supplier of wholesale voice services and interconnect to mobile operators and carriers
with customers including incumbent former monopolies, mobile operators and regional telecommunications
companies and service providers.

Cable & Wireless offers mobile voice and messaging services, principally using GPRS/GSM technology and
TDMA technology. As at 31st March, 2003, Cable & Wireless subsidiaries and branches provided mobile
telecommunications services to 1.6 million customers around the world.

Where Cable & Wireless is the local incumbent operator (the Caribbean, Panama, Macau and Rest of
World), business customers are typically served through Cable & Wireless’ own fixed line and mobile network
facilities. In other regions, business customers are primarily connected to the Cable & Wireless network via third
party local loops and leased line facilities or directly via fibre or microwave links.

Data

Cable & Wireless has a portfolio of data services including traditional data transport services (frame relay)
and national and international switched and dedicated services based on ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode, a
high speed digital transmission technology).


-----

In addition, Cable & Wireless operates a GPRS Roaming Exchange service, GRX, which enables mobile
operators to offer users secure, high-speed wireless access to data services, such as email or corporate intranet
access, wherever they are in the world. As at 31st March, 2003, Cable & Wireless has connected 31 mobile
operators direct to the GRX and links more than 90 mobile operators world wide through interconnect
agreements.

IP

Cable & Wireless focuses on three IP product sets:

IP communications that enable customers to migrate from traditional telecommunications services to IP
services with improved functionality; access solutions; and transit to IP networks and the internet. Access
solutions include value-added security services such as managed firewalls, intrusion detection and response,
scanning and analysis (for example, email virus protection) and authentication and encryption services.

In the Caribbean, Panama, Macau and Rest of World, Cable & Wireless also provides residential and
business customers with dial-up IP and other internet services, including broad band ADSL (asymmetrical digital
subscriber line) solutions.

Hosting

Cable & Wireless offers a range of integrated managed hosting, intelligent network services, content
delivery and other value-added services to business customers. Cable & Wireless’ US operations generate some
75 per cent. of these revenues.

Geographic Markets

Europe, Panama, Macau and Rest of World.

Cable & Wireless provides voice, data and IP services to large corporates (Enterprise), SME (Business) and
residential customers. In addition, in the United Kingdom, the Caribbean, the United States, Japan and
continental Europe, Cable & Wireless provides specialist wholesale services to carriers, mobile operators and
content, application and internet providers (Wholesale).

For a discussion of Cable & Wireless’ revenue by geographic market for the past 3 years, see ‘‘Operating
and Financial Review – Turnover’’.

United Kingdom

Overview

The UK telecommunications market is mature with a considerable number of competitors, significant
network capacity and competitive pricing.

In the United Kingdom, Cable & Wireless is the largest fixed line telecommunications services provider
after British Telecommunications (BT), the former state-owned monopoly telecommunications provider. UK
operations provide a full range of services from international and domestic voice and data and IP services to
complex web hosting solutions.

At 31st March, 2003, Cable & Wireless UK provided services to approximately one third of the UK
wholesale market and one sixth of the UK retail telecommunications market.

Enterprise (Revenue £449 million)

Enterprise customers consist of large international and national corporate customers to which Cable &
Wireless provides a range of direct services and outsourced or customised solutions. In the United Kingdom,
Cable & Wireless provides international services to some customers, principally those in the Financial Markets
and Media sectors.

Wholesale (Revenue £725 million)

Wholesale operations generate some 40 per cent. of Cable & Wireless UK’s revenue. The market is highly
competitive. Demand from other carriers has fallen as they migrate to their own networks or face lower customer
demand and financial difficulties.


-----

In the United Kingdom, the primary customers are mobile operators and the companies which developed
after de-regulation (other licensed operators), and Cable & Wireless provides interconnect capacity to enable
them to offer national and international coverage to their customers.

Wholesale launched Carrier pre-select (CPS) in July 2002 – a method of indirect voice access, which
enables UK residential consumers to select an alternative operator to BT for their voice calls in advance, without
having to dial additional codes or programming on-site equipment.

Business (Revenue £554 million)

Services to Business customers generated approximately one third of 2003 revenue in the United Kingdom.

Business provides direct and telesales services to smaller corporate customers with less complex
requirements. At 31st March, 2003, it had approximately 1,000 such customers. Business also handles central
government agencies and institutions.

In addition, approximately 54,000 SME businesses are served by selling the whole range of products and
services with and through partners, alliances and third parties.

Cable & Wireless formed the ALLnet group during the year from the integration of six smaller entities.
ALLnet provides a single source for hardware installation and maintenance of voice, data and cabling systems,
together with systems development and integration for the information and communications technologies
industry in the United Kingdom and Ireland.

Caribbean

Cable & Wireless operates in 15 Caribbean territories. The principal territories are Jamaica, Barbados,
Cayman Islands and Trinidad and Tobago.

In nearly all of the Caribbean territories in which it operates, Cable & Wireless is the incumbent, fixed and
mobile operator providing some or all of the domestic and international telecommunications.

In the Caribbean territories where Cable & Wireless subsidiaries and branches provide domestic telephone
services, the total number of telephone lines in service totalled approximately 860,000 at 31st March, 2003, an
overall decrease of approximately 20,000 in the year. During the same period, the mobile subscribers of these
subsidiaries and branches increased by approximately 370,000 to 940,000.

Cable & Wireless has mobile licences in all of its Caribbean territories with the exception of the British
Virgin Islands and Bermuda. The Caribbean operations provide a range of mobile services, including pre- and
post-paid subscriptions, short messaging service (SMS) and international inbound and outbound roaming.

Cable & Wireless is investing in a new GSM/GPRS (General Packet Radio Services) network in the
Caribbean which is expected to be rolled out during 2004, commencing with Jamaica, Barbados and the Cayman
Islands. GSM/GPRS technology provides higher transmission speeds enabling Cable & Wireless to offer new
mobile services including internet access, multimedia messaging and E-banking.

The Caribbean operations also provide a full range of internet services to customers, including dial-up, direct
connect, web hosting, web-site design and its ADSL services which provide broadband access.

Many of the Caribbean markets in which Cable & Wireless operates are in transition from long-standing
monopoly environments to competitive markets. With the global trend towards liberalisation of
telecommunication markets, Cable & Wireless is actively engaged with host governments, where they desire
to reach agreement to end exclusive licences and provide for an orderly transition to a competitive environment.
These discussions involve negotiating regulatory arrangements to provide for the orderly introduction of fair,
sustainable competition.

The implementation of the liberalisation process is well advanced in many Cable & Wireless host territories.
The table below shows the dates of market liberalisation for the principal Caribbean subsidiaries.

-----

Subsequent to the commencement of the phased liberalisation process in Jamaica, several other Caribbean
governments, notably Barbados and some members of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS)
have endorsed a broadly similar approach.

On 20th May, 2002, the leaders of certain OECS Countries (Grenada, St Lucia, St Vincent & the
Grenadines, St Kitts & Nevis and Dominica) and Cable & Wireless signed an agreement which paves the way for
fully competitive markets in these territories. Under this agreement, these markets were fully liberalised with
retrospective effect from 1st April, 2002.

Jamaica

Jamaica is the largest of the Caribbean operations generating over 40 per cent. of the Caribbean’s revenue in
2003. Cable & Wireless holds an 82 per cent. interest in Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited, the largest provider
of telecommunications services in Jamaica.

Cable & Wireless Jamaica provides domestic and international fixed line and mobile telecommunication
services to consumers and business customers. In addition to Cable & Wireless Jamaica, there are currently three
competitors in the mobile and domestic fixed line sectors, as well as a number of resellers.

The Jamaican telecommunications market is dominated by the mobile sector. Cable & Wireless estimates
that there are approximately 2.5 times more mobile subscribers in the market than fixed line.

Barbados

Cable & Wireless (Barbados) Limited is 81 per cent. owned and provides domestic and international fixed
line and mobile telecommunications services to consumers and business customers.

There are currently no competitors for mobile services but, on 7th March, 2003 the government announced
its intention to issue three new mobile licences. There are four other ISPs who offer internet services to end
customers over Cable & Wireless’ network.

Cayman Islands

Cable and Wireless (Cayman Islands) Limited provides domestic, international and mobile services in the
Cayman Islands under an exclusive licence, signed in 1991, which expires in 2011. Negotiations are under way
with the government to address the future of this licence.

Trinidad and Tobago

Cable & Wireless owns 49 per cent. of Telecommunications Services of Trinidad and Tobago Limited
(TSTT). The controlling 51 per cent. shareholding is owned by National Enterprises Limited, a state-owned
company. TSTT provides domestic and international fixed line and mobile telecommunications services to
consumers and business customers.

In March 2003, TSTT launched its Mobile GSM/GPRS service, being one of the first islands in the
Caribbean to launch a full GSM service.

United States

Overview

The US business, which includes a number of legal entities, including Cable & Wireless USA, Inc. and
Cable & Wireless Internet Services, operates under the brand name Cable & Wireless America, and was formed
during 2002. Cable & Wireless America serves the Wholesale, Enterprise and Business customer segments with
hosting and IP services generating nearly three quarters of revenue.

The US telecommunications market is a mature market with a considerable number of participants and over
capacity in many areas leading to intense competition. In addition, certain competitors in the United States have
filed for Chapter 11 protection and may emerge with a significantly lower cost base than the Group and so be able
to compete more effectively.

In May 2002, Cable & Wireless announced a restructuring of its existing US business and, in line with this
strategy, announced the disposal of the retail voice and data customer bases in September 2002. In response to a
further deterioration in trading conditions between March and September 2002, Cable & Wireless conducted a
further business review.


-----

In November 2002, a further restructuring of the US business was announced. As part of this restructuring,
Cable & Wireless America terminated its international voice and domestic e-messaging businesses in the second
half of 2002. During the same period, Cable & Wireless America initiated the migration of customers from data
centres to be closed, network rationalisation and consolidation, and headcount reductions.

The restructuring anticipated the closure of 11 data centres, and a reduction in headcount of 2,400. Since
making the announcement 5 of the data centres have been closed, and a headcount reduction of 1,900 has been
achieved.

The US business continues to be loss making. In 2003, Cable & Wireless America generated revenue of
£512 million and incurred a total operating loss of £1,681 million. As discussed under ‘‘Description of Cable &
Wireless – Corporate Overview’’, Cable & Wireless has announced its intention to withdraw from its US
operations. In connection with consideration of a variety of options, Cable & Wireless’ US subsidiaries have
taken some initial steps.

Japan

Overview

In Japan, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT), the former national incumbent, has
approximately 75 per cent. of the overall market. Cable & Wireless IDC Inc has about 3 per cent. of the
remaining market, as the fifth largest provider.

Cable & Wireless’ operations in Japan serve a full range of customers including residential, local and
international businesses. They also provide wholesale services to other operators.

Business and Residential (Revenue £208 million)

In Japan, Cable & Wireless IDC sells mostly voice and data products into the small and medium sized
business market both directly through its own sales force and also through a variety of agents and partners to
access target customers. Over the last year, this particular customer base has been segmented further with larger
corporations being accessed exclusively through a direct sales force and with smaller business customers and
residential customers now being served exclusively through indirect channels and resellers. Cable & Wireless
IDC has 80,000 residential and 20,000 business customers.

Wholesale (Revenue £75 million)

Cable & Wireless IDC sells mostly voice products to other operators. This market is in transition as many
carriers shift from leased facilities to their own networks.

Enterprise (Revenue £40 million)

Cable & Wireless IDC, together with operations across the rest of Asia, also provides a full range of services
to large nationals and multinationals from voice and data and IP services to complex web hosting solutions.

Continental Europe

The principal operations in Continental Europe are in France, Italy, Germany and Spain, together with
smaller operations in Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and Russia.

The continental European operations are currently being refocused on Enterprise customers and the existing
wholesale business. Operations providing services to the small and medium sized customer market are being sold
or shut down.

It is anticipated that the reorganisation will result in a reduction in the European network coverage from 33 to
19 nodes and a reduction in customer numbers from 15,000 to fewer than 1,000.

Wholesale revenues of £223 million represent some three quarters of revenue in continental Europe. The
main wholesale customers are mobile operators and telecommunications operators.

Cable & Wireless Europe intends to substantially withdraw from the business customer sector, which
accounted for £62 million in 2003, as it is not a financially attractive segment.

Cable & Wireless has completed disposals of certain non-core businesses and assets that had focused on
supporting small and medium sized customers in continental Europe. These include the sale of a number of
operations in Northern Europe (Belgium, Netherlands, Sweden), Switzerland and Germany. In addition, Cable &


-----

Wireless has reached binding agreement subject to completion of certain preconditions on the sale of its non-core
business in Russia. Cable & Wireless is in advanced discussions on the sale of its non-core businesses in France
and Spain and expects to complete a transaction in France by September or earlier. The impact of these
transactions, taken together, has been to reduce substantially the potential costs of exit from these non-core
businesses.

Panama

Cable & Wireless owns a 49 per cent. interest in, and has management control of, the largest
telecommunications company in Panama, Cable & Wireless Panama S.A. The Panamanian government holds
49 per cent. of the shares while the remaining 2 per cent. are held by the company’s employees through a trust
fund.

During 2002 and 2003, approximately 40 new licences were issued to operators to commence offering basic
voice telephony services during 2003. Cable & Wireless Panama is in the process of negotiating interconnection
agreements with several of these operators. At 31st March, 2003, competition in fixed line services was largely
confined to international and national long-distance services.

There are two licensees in the mobile market in Panama: Cable & Wireless Panama and BSC de Panama SA
(Bell South). Cable & Wireless was the second entrant into this market. Cable & Wireless believes that mobile
penetration in Panama is relatively low at approximately 15 per cent.

Cable & Wireless Panama provides a full range of internet services to customers, including dial-up, web
hosting, web-site design and broadband access. The internet sector has always been competitive and at
31st March, 2003 there were some 70 competitors in the sector.

Macau

In Macau, Cable & Wireless’ subsidiary is Companhia de Telecomunicac¸o˜es de Macau S.A.R.L. (CTM).
CTM is managed and 51 per cent. owned by Cable & Wireless. The other shareholders of CTM are
Portugal Telecom Group, 28 per cent., CITIC Pacific Limited, 20 per cent., and Direcc¸a˜o dos Servic¸os de
Correios de Macau, 1 per cent.

CTM has exclusive rights to operate fixed local and international telecommunications services within, to and
from Macau until the end of 2011.

In the Macau telecommunications market, mobiles outnumber fixed lines. The mobile market was liberalised
in 2001 and two competitors launched services in August 2001.

In Macau, CTM offers fixed local and international services and a full range of mobile services including
GSM/GPRS and Multi-Media Messaging Services via eight branded retail outlets. CTM also provides a full range
of internet services to customers, including dial-up, web hosting, web-site design and broadband access.

In 2002, Cable & Wireless was granted international services-based telecommunications licences in
Hong Kong and Singapore and now provides data and internet services to business customers. The facilities in
Hong Kong started carrying commercial traffic in January 2002, those in Singapore in April 2002. Macau
provides back office and management services to these operations.

Rest of World

Rest of World comprises Cable & Wireless’ businesses in Yemen, Bahrain and the Maldives, smaller
operations in the Seychelles, Diego Garcia, Falkland Islands, Ascension, St Helena, Guernsey and Sakhalin in
Russia, together with Cable & Wireless Regional’s head office functions. Yemen and the Maldives account for
59 per cent. of the Rest of World revenue.

Yemen

Cable & Wireless provides international services to and from the Yemen through the Yemen International
Telecommunications Company (L.L.C.) (TeleYemen) of which Cable & Wireless owns 51 per cent. TeleYemen
holds the exclusive licence to provide international services to and from the Yemen. TeleYemen also has licences
to provide an analogue mobile service and is an Internet Service Provider. These licences expire on
31st December, 2003. Cable & Wireless has begun negotiations with the government in respect of these licences.


-----

Maldives

Cable & Wireless has a 45 per cent. interest in, and management control of, Dhivehi Raajjeyge Gulhun
Private Limited (Dhiraagu). The remaining 55 per cent. is held by the government of the Maldives. Dhiraagu
provides domestic and international fixed and mobile telecommunication services to consumers and business
customers. Internet services were liberalised in January 2003.

Bahrain

Cable & Wireless owns 20 per cent. of Bahrain Telecommunications Company (Batelco). Batelco provides
domestic and international fixed line and mobile telecommunication services to consumer and business
customers. The telecommunications market in Bahrain has begun liberalisation and Batelco has begun
discussions with the government in respect of future licensing arrangements.

Infrastructure

In the Caribbean, Panama and Macau, Cable & Wireless typically operates as the domestic incumbent,
owning and operating the domestic fixed line networks and associated international interconnect facilities. Cable
& Wireless also has network reach within the domestic markets of the United Kingdom, Japan and the
United States. In other countries and territories, including Yemen, Cable & Wireless operates primarily as an
international gateway, without extensive domestic networks.

Cable & Wireless is the world’s fourth largest international carrier of voice traffic and operates significant
international submarine cable and satellite systems which are centrally managed within the United Kingdom. The
IP backbone AS3561, provides seamless IP connectivity to the United Kingdom, United States, European and
Japan regions.

Many of Cable & Wireless’ subsidiaries also own and operate mobile networks, including in the Caribbean
(TDMA network in Jamaica, GSM/GPRS in Trinidad and Tobago), Panama (TDMA and GSM/GPRS), Macau
(GSM/GPRS), the Maldives (GSM) and Bahrain (GSM). Cable & Wireless companies also operate 45 data
centres within the United States, Japan and the United Kingdom offering a wide selection of web-based and
hosting services.

REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

Cable & Wireless, in common with other international telecommunication providers, faces regulatory and
market access constraints in various countries resulting from restrictive laws, policies and licensing requirements.
This reflects the perception of telecommunications as a public service, a history of special or exclusive rights to
provide services and, often, a structured move towards liberalisation and the introduction of competition.
Generally, specialist telecommunications regulation is administered through enforcement of conditions contained
in operating and service licences held by the Group and its subsidiaries.

Approximately 60 per cent. of Cable & Wireless’ network services revenues are derived from the United
Kingdom, the United States and continental Europe, in each of which the telecommunications sector has been
largely liberalised and competition introduced in the services Cable & Wireless provides.

Many of the other markets in which Cable & Wireless operates are in transition from long-standing
monopoly environments to competitive markets. With the global trend towards liberalisation of
telecommunication markets, Cable & Wireless is actively engaged with host governments who desire it to
reach agreement to end exclusive licences and provide for an orderly transition into a fully competitive
environment. The discussions involve negotiating fair regulatory arrangements to provide for equal treatment and
opportunity during the transitional period.

Nevertheless, some restrictive telecommunications laws and regulations are expected to continue in force,
giving rise to residual constraints, risks and uncertainties that will affect Cable & Wireless’ ability to develop and
market its full portfolio of services.

A key regulatory issue in many markets is the need for ‘rebalancing’, the removal of cross-subsidies
between international services and domestic services by increasing domestic charges and reducing international
rates. There is further impetus to rebalance in the form of external pressure on international settlement rates.

The Group believes it materially complies with regulatory obligations and where regulatory compliance
issues emerge it intends to take action as necessary to ensure compliance.


-----

Licensing

Cable & Wireless provides international and domestic telecommunications services under exclusive and
non-exclusive licences in the jurisdictions in which it operates. These licences are either held by Cable &
Wireless itself or by local operating entities owned either wholly or partly, directly or indirectly, by Cable &
Wireless.

The Group believes it has all licences material to the running of its business. It is possible that from time to
time, as further products and services are deployed or changed, additional licences or authorisations will be
required. Where the Group identifies the need for further licences or authorisations, it intends to acquire such
licences. The terms of the Group’s licences vary, although most remain in effect for a fixed period of between 10
and 25 years, or for an indefinite period subject to notice of termination after a specified minimum period.
Licence fees are sometimes required, either as a fixed annual fee or a fee equal to a percentage of the revenue
arising from the licence.

Following the implementation of the European Electronic Communications Directives on 25th July, 2003,
Member States of the European Union will no longer issue individual telecommunications licences to companies
except in exceptional circumstances such as the allocation of spectrum. Therefore, Cable & Wireless expects that
substantially all telecommunications licences Cable & Wireless holds in European Union Member States will be
revoked. However, Cable & Wireless will continue to offer telecommunications services subject to obligations
set forth in general conditions as dictated by the Electronic Communications Directive and individual Member
States.

Some licences provide that, upon their termination, the government may purchase, or have the option to
purchase, the property, plant and equipment of the licensee in that territory. In some cases where the Group owns
an operating company jointly with a government, that government has the right to purchase, at specified times,
the whole or part of the Group’s shareholding in the operating company.

Across the world, the trend in telecommunications regulation is for governments and regulators to promote
liberalisation and to replace exclusive licences with non-exclusive licences and rules governing competition
between operators. Jurisdictions that currently support monopoly provision may also decide to promote
competition, and Cable & Wireless expects that some of the remaining exclusive licences will not be renewed on
an exclusive basis or that governments will seek to withdraw their exclusivity before the licence expires.

The Group has committed itself to entering discussions regarding the introduction of competition in any
territory where the relevant government wishes to do so.

There is no guarantee that an agreement to provide either a monopoly or franchised service will remain in
effect for the full term of the agreement.

Regulation by Jurisdiction

The regulatory institutions and policies of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates are varied.
Regulators in markets for the Group include the Office of Telecommunications and Office of Fair Trading in the
United Kingdom, the Ministry of Public Management, Home Affairs, Posts and Telecommunications in Japan,
and the Federal Communications Commission and Department of Justice in the United States. Cable & Wireless
USA is also subject to state regulations when it provides intra-state services. National regulators and competition
authorities in continental Europe are also significant. The regulatory framework for member states of the
European Union is principally established through Directives of the European Parliament and Council developed
at the working level by the European Commission. The Group’s operations in the Caribbean are regulated by
national or regional regulators, some of which are independent statutory bodies like the Office of Utilities
Regulation in Jamaica, the Eastern Caribbean Telecommunications Authority, which is the regional regulator for
several member countries of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States, and the Fair Trading Commission in
Barbados. The national regulator, Ente Regulador de los Servicios Publicos, regulates the Group’s operations in
Panama.

United Kingdom

The telecommunications market in the United Kingdom is regulated under the Telecommunications Act
1984 (UK Telecoms Act). The UK Telecoms Act established the Director General of the Office of
Telecommunications (Oftel) as the independent industry regulator. As a member of the European Union, the
UK government must also ensure that the UK regulatory framework for communications complies with relevant
EU directives.


-----

As a network operator, Cable & Wireless UK has the right to request and receive cost-based interconnection
for switched voice services and leased line access circuits (Partial Private Circuits) from BT on nondiscriminatory terms. Such services are subject to network charge controls. Oftel is currently formulating a new
proposed framework for regulating dominant providers of network facilities. However, Cable & Wireless expects
that the regulation of BT with respect to Partial Private Circuits and switched voice interconnect will be broadly
similar to the regulations in place today.

Cable & Wireless has been designated as having ‘Market Influence’ on a number of International Direct Dial
(IDD) routes from the United Kingdom. In total there are 37 retail IDD routes and 38 wholesale IDD routes
where Cable & Wireless currently is designated with Market Influence status, although these designations are
currently under review as part of the process for implementing EU directives. Subject to consultation, it appears
that following the implementation of the package of directives, Cable & Wireless will have a designation of
‘Significant Market Power’ on wholesale IDD services from the United Kingdom to four destinations: Andorra,
Ascension Island, Montserrat and Turks & Caicos.

The British government is reforming existing telecommunications and broadcasting legislation and draft
legislation was introduced to Parliament in November 2002 in the form of a Draft Communications Bill. It is
proposed that the Bill will update broadcasting and telecommunications legislation taking into account the
requirements of the EU Telecommunications Directives. It will also lay out the powers held by the Office of
Communications (Ofcom), the new regulator that was created in 2002. The Chairman, Chief Executive and
various Board Members of Ofcom have now been appointed, although they have no power to act until Ofcom
formally replaces the existing broadcasting and telecommunications regulators in late 2003 or 2004.

Europe

Cable & Wireless operates under separate licences in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy,
Ireland, the Isle of Man, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Switzerland, and the
United Kingdom. The regulatory framework in member states of the European Union is harmonised by EU
directives though, in practice, there are divergences in regulatory policy and practice between member states.

The European Union adopted a new package of harmonising directives (Framework, Authorisation,
Universal Service, Access and Interconnection and Data Protection directives) in April 2002. Member states must
implement the directives by 25th July, 2003. The package uses the concept of significant market power to
determine which operators should have prior obligations placed on them, on the grounds that such operators
might exploit that market position to the detriment of competition and therefore consumers.

One of the markets being reviewed is the market for call termination on fixed public telephone networks. It
is likely that National Regulatory Authorities will decide that all operators of public voice telephony networks
have significant market power on calls terminating on their own networks. If this is the case, Cable & Wireless
would be designated as having ‘Significant Market Power’ for calls terminating on each of Cable & Wireless’
national voice networks. However, due to this concept being applied to all operators, obligations are likely to be
minimal and the Group expects there will be little or no competitive impact.

Japan

Cable & Wireless IDC holds a Type I (facility holding and service providing) licence and a General Type II
(service providing) licence. Among the services Cable & Wireless IDC provides in Japan are web hosting,
international and domestic voice and data services, Internet Protocol access, managed corporate services, and
wholesale services to other carriers in the Asian region.

The Japanese legislature is undertaking a reform of Telecommunication Business Law. This reform is likely
to abolish the separation of telecommunication business licences between Type I and Type II, and allow a
significant degree of tariff deregulation, relieving non-dominant operators of the need to file tariffs. This revision
may also introduce a degree of tariff deregulation to Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT), the
incumbent telecommunications provider, which could impact Cable & Wireless IDC’s pricing competitiveness in
certain instances. The legislature is expected to pass the new Telecommunication Business Law in the second half
of calendar year 2003, with related implementation ordinances drafted thereafter. The new Telecommunication
Business Law is expected to come into force during calendar year 2004.

NTT East and NTT West, which serve the eastern and western areas of Japan respectively, have secured
authorisation for regional IP access services within their service areas. These authorisations may increase the
degree of competition faced by Cable & Wireless IDC, but also provide some benefits to the company through the
availability of cheaper wholesale data services.


-----

Interconnection charges for origination and termination of traffic on the networks of NTT East and NTT
West impact the profitability of Cable & Wireless IDC’s voice business. The Ministry of Public Management,
Home Affairs, Posts and Telecommunications (MPHPT) regulates these interconnection charges. Certain
interconnection charges used by Cable & Wireless IDC’s voice services increased by 12 per cent. on 1st April,
2003 and there is the possibility of further retrospective increases later in this year. Current regulatory
proceedings could assist Cable & Wireless IDC by allowing it to set retail prices for calls-to-mobiles, which
prices are currently set by the mobile network operators. A MPHPT working group is currently studying these
arrangements, particularly in relation to calls originated on the subscriber lines of NTT East and NTT West. The
MPHPT working group is due to report during calendar year 2003.

Legislation to establish a Universal Service Fund was passed in 2001, but the Japanese government has not
yet announced an intention to impose levies on carriers. There remains, however, a possibility that Cable &
Wireless IDC will be liable to make payments in future years. There is also a proposed cap on contributions at
3 per cent. of retail voice revenue, thereby limiting overall liability in any given year.

United States

The principal legislation regulating telecommunications services in the United States is the Communications
Act of 1934 as amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (US Communications Act). Title II of the
US Communications Act establishes a comprehensive regulatory regime for common carriers involved in
interstate or international communications by wire. Cable & Wireless USA is licensed under the
US Communications Act.

Because it offers interstate and international telecommunications services to businesses generally and not
just to selected customers, Cable & Wireless USA Inc., for regulated services, is a common carrier subject to
Title II regulation.

Title II requires common carriers to provide telecommunications services upon reasonable request, to
provide services on rates and terms which are just and reasonable, to obtain the approval of the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) for the construction of new or the extension of existing international
facilities and for the initiation and discontinuance of service offerings, and to comply with any applicable orders
issued by the FCC. The FCC has, by regulation, suspended certain other requirements for non-dominant common
carriers providing domestic interstate telecommunications services. Cable & Wireless USA is deemed a
non-dominant common carrier in the provision of interstate domestic service. Cable & Wireless USA may thus,
under the current FCC regulation, construct new interstate facilities, offer new services and set interstate prices
with minimal FCC review, subject only to general FCC reporting requirements. As a common carrier of interstate
telecommunications services, Cable & Wireless USA is also required to contribute to the Federal Universal
Service Fund.

Cable & Wireless USA offers international telecommunications services principally on a resale basis. On
some routes, Cable & Wireless USA is deemed a dominant carrier because it is an affiliate of a foreign carrier that
is considered by the FCC to be dominant in that foreign market.

Subsequent to its acquisition of selected assets of Exodus, Cable & Wireless began discussions with the
US government regarding the terms on which the company might file and clear review by the Committee on
Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). Given Cable & Wireless’ announcement of its intention to exit
the US business market, the discussions have been discontinued.

Other markets

During the year, both Panama and Jamaica reached the conclusion of a phased liberalisation process, with
the opening of all market sectors to competition in January and March 2003, respectively. Both these processes
proceeded as contemplated in agreements struck between Cable & Wireless and the governments of those
territories. Subsequent to the commencement of the phased liberalisation process in Jamaica, several other
Caribbean governments, notably Barbados, and some members of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States,
have endorsed a broadly similar approach.

Regulation relating to Online Content and Internet Protocol Networks

Online Content

Governments around the world are adopting and proposing legislation and regulations, and courts are
creating case law, making certain types of online content illegal. A critical issue in the development of those
legislative and regulatory arrangements is whether Cable & Wireless, as a web hosting and internet service


-----

provider, might be deemed responsible for illegal content or illegal conduct related to legal content (for example,
downloading copyrighted material) operated or controlled by customers of Cable & Wireless services. At present,
most jurisdictions have taken a position that the content provider, not the web hosting provider or internet service
provider, is responsible for the content that it develops or posts, an approach supported by Cable & Wireless.
Copyright law in the United States and European Union extends protection to digital works distributed over the
internet and clarifies the hierarchy of liability for infringements of copyright. Also, the European Union has
adopted a directive that makes it clear that service providers are not liable for hosted content but must take
appropriate action when notified that illegal content resides on their network.

In addition, industry self-regulation is actively encouraged in the United States and by the European
Commission and the industry supports a number of successful self-regulatory initiatives world wide. For
example, many governments have endorsed the Internet Content Rating Association as a model for the
self-labelling and rating of websites, which empowers parents to filter internet content viewed by their children.
An extensive network of national hotlines for internet users to report criminal content (mainly child pornography)
is operating well, co-funded by industry and government.

Between countries there is the possibility for conflict concerning the definition of illegal internet content.
Consequently, Cable & Wireless recognises the risks that content legally hosted in one jurisdiction may give rise
to a breach of national laws when accessed in another jurisdiction. The industry as a whole faces this situation
and it remains one of the key policy issues to be resolved as national governments determine the appropriate legal
framework for the internet.

An increasing number of countries have strengthened national anti-terrorism laws and the protection of
national communications infrastructure. Measures include modifications to the framework for legal interception,
access to retained or preserved data and, in the case of the United Kingdom and some continental European
countries, moves to extend retention periods for law enforcement purposes.

Internet protocol (IP) networks

At present, regulation of IP networks is minimal. Some national regulators and international organisations
(for example, the International Telecommunication Union) have been discussing market concentration in IP
backbone services. Also, there is ongoing debate in international regulatory circles about the cost of connectivity
from developing countries to the internet and the impact that such costs may have on the ‘digital divide’. In the
United States and the European Union, regulators appear to be of the view that, at this time, there is an acceptable
level of market concentration in IP backbone services and competition law is an adequate safeguard against
excessive concentration and the abuse of market power and that, consequently, no special regulation of IP
networks is required.

PROPERTY

The property portfolio of Cable & Wireless and its subsidiaries at 31st March, 2003 amounted to
approximately 16 million square feet of freehold and leasehold technical and office space, located primarily in the
United Kingdom and United States, although the spread of properties extends across Continental Europe, Asia,
and the Caribbean. Numerically, the bulk of properties are technical and house equipment necessary to support
Cable & Wireless’ operations worldwide.

The vast majority of the existing portfolio is leased. In general, Cable & Wireless’ technical properties enjoy
the protection of telecommunications legislation, which has the aim of ensuring the continuity of Cable &
Wireless’ networks.

Over the last few years, most Cable & Wireless companies have initiated major projects with the aim of
substantially reducing the size of their property portfolios, to match Cable & Wireless’ streamlined headcount
and business rationalisation. Project planning is well advanced, generally focusing on reducing office space
which is easier to dispose of because there are fewer constraints than apply to technical properties and there is a
larger market for office properties.

Whilst disposals are being pursued across the Group as part of these projects, acquisition of both office and
technical sites still occurs where required.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Class action litigation against Cable and Wireless plc

Between December 2002 and February 2003, ten shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia naming Cable and Wireless plc and several of its officers
and Directors as defendants.

In March 2003, the court consolidated all of the cases into one action, styled as In re Cable and Wireless plc
Securities Litigation, Civil Action No. 02-1860-A. The Court has appointed Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan
Board, an institutional investor located in Canada, and Alex Osinski, a U.S. citizen, as co-lead plaintiffs
(collectively lead plaintiffs) to prosecute on behalf of all plaintiffs.

In May 2003, the lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint that alleges violations of certain sections of
the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules promulgated thereunder. A central allegation is that the
defendants made false and misleading statements about the Company’s financial condition by failing to disclose
on a timely basis the existence of a tax indemnity and a ratings trigger to place money in escrow until any liability
which the Company may have had under the tax indemnity was finally determined. The indemnity and ratings
trigger appear in an agreement between the Company and Deutsche Telekom for the sale of the Company’s
interest in the mobile telephone company that operated under the name One2One.

In addition to the allegations relating to the tax indemnity, the consolidated complaint also alleges that the
defendants made false and misleading statements by: (1) failing to disclose certain lease liability commitments
and (2) improperly recognising revenue received from sales of capacity to other carriers.

The plaintiffs seek unspecified money damages in their complaints and, accordingly, it is not possible to set
out the quantum of these claims.

Cable & Wireless believes that it has meritorious defences to these claims and intends to vigorously defend
itself in this litigation.

Dispute with IBM UK Limited

Disputes between (1) Cable and Wireless plc and IBM United Kingdom Limited, (2) Cable & Wireless
USA, Inc. and International Business Machines Corporation and (3) IBM Japan Limited and Cable & Wireless
IDC Incorporated (collectively Cable & Wireless and IBM respectively) have arisen out of a Global Framework
Agreement (GFA) dated 20th December, 2000, and related agreements, pursuant to which IBM agreed to supply
to Cable & Wireless information technology services.

In order to monitor the quality of the services provided by IBM, including price and service levels, the GFA
contains ‘benchmarking’ provisions, which set out the processes and procedures by which the services provided
by IBM are to be assessed against a pre-determined objective. In February 2002, the parties engaged Compass
America Inc (Compass) to conduct a benchmark for the 14 month period from 1st January, 2001 to
28th February, 2002, the results of which revealed significant levels of overcharging by IBM.

Disputes arose as to whether the GFA obliged IBM to repay to Cable & Wireless the amounts that the
benchmark established it has been overcharged and as to whether the Compass reports were valid both in terms of
their substance and conformity with the GFA benchmarking requirements. On 4th July, 2002, the Company
issued proceedings for a declaration that it is entitled to compensation from IBM UK for any period of
overcharging, including past overcharging, and to compensation in respect of overcharging as identified
by Compass.

After an inconclusive Court-ordered mediation that took place in December 2002, the Court ordered an
expedited trial of all matters in issue between the parties. Full pleadings were then exchanged. Cable & Wireless
seeks a declaration as to the meaning of certain overcharging related provisions of the GFA and compensation for
overcharging by IBM. From January 2001 to the date Cable & Wireless’ proceedings were issued, its claim in
respect of overcharging by IBM amounts to approximately £115 million in respect of the United Kingdom and
approximately US$22 million in respect of the United States. For each month that IBM refuses to reduce its
charges a further substantial overcharge arises. IBM UK and IBM US seek the declaration in respect of the
Compass reports referred to above and IBM UK has brought counterclaims in respect of work it alleges Cable &
Wireless should have given to it under the GFA and claims damages to be assessed. IBM Japan Limited seeks
payment of certain charges allegedly due and payable to it by Cable & Wireless IDC Inc. Subsequently, on 21st
February, 2003, the Court directed that Cable & Wireless’ claim as to the meaning of certain overcharging related
provisions of the GFA should be heard separately from the other claims and counterclaims as a preliminary issue.
The preliminary issue has been set for trial in September 2003.


-----

Cable & Wireless believes that it has meritorious defences to the counter claims asserted by IBM and
intends to vigorously defend itself in this litigation.

Claim by APCC Services, Inc. and others

On 30th March, 2001, a complaint was filed in the US District Court for the District of Columbia against
Cable & Wireless USA, Inc. and was served on Cable & Wireless USA, Inc. on 25th June 2001. The complaint
was filed by a group of billing and collection agents on behalf of hundreds of entities that own and operate public
payphones throughout the United States. The complaint alleges that Cable & Wireless USA, Inc. violated the
US Communications Act and the rules, regulations, and orders of the Federal Communications Commission by
not adequately compensating the independent payphone operators for toll free and access code calls that were
made from the independent payphone operators’ payphones and carried over Cable & Wireless USA, Inc.’s
network.

The complaint seeks approximately US$5 million in monetary damages. In August 2001, Cable & Wireless
USA, Inc. and the plaintiff entered into a tolling agreement whereby the obligations of the parties in litigation
would be suspended until 1st November, 2001, while the parties attempted to resolve the dispute informally.
Plaintiffs refiled their complaint which is now pending in the US District Court for the District of Columbia.
The parties agreed to a confidential, non-binding, third-party neutral evaluation for settlement purposes which is
currently ongoing.

Cable & Wireless USA, Inc. believes that it has meritorious defences to the claims. If the dispute is not
resolved through the neutral evaluation process, Cable & Wireless USA, Inc. intends to vigorously defend the
action.

Litigation against Digital Island, Inc./Cable & Wireless Internet Services, Inc.

As described in ‘‘Description of Cable & Wireless – History’’, in 2002 Cable & Wireless acquired 100 per
cent. of Digital Island, which is now known as Cable & Wireless Internet Services, Inc.

Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) filed a patent
infringement suit against Digital Island on 13th September, 2000 in the US District Court for the District of
Massachusetts, alleging that a version of Digital Island’s content delivery service infringes a patent owned by
MIT and licensed exclusively to Akamai. On 20th September, 2000, Akamai and MIT filed a further claim
alleging infringement by Digital Island of a second Akamai patent.

On 21st December, 2001, a jury invalidated three of the claims related to one of the Akamai patents. The jury
also found that Digital Island infringed one independent claim and three dependent claims of this patent. Digital
Island was found not to have infringed the other patent. On 23rd August, 2002, the Court entered a permanent
injunction prohibiting further infringement of certain of the surviving claims. Cable & Wireless has revised its
content delivery service (at little cost to and with no other effect on its customers) in such a way that Cable &
Wireless believes that the infringement no longer exists and that the injunction is of no effect. Nevertheless, on
17th September, 2002, Akamai filed a contempt motion with the Court asserting that Cable & Wireless Internet
Services, Inc. is violating the injunction by continuing to infringe the surviving Akamai claims. The Court denied
Akamai’s motion on 1st November, 2002. A damages trial has not yet been scheduled on the infringed claims. In
the meantime, Cable & Wireless has appealed the permanent injunction against it to the United States Appeals
Court for the Federal Circuit. Oral argument was heard on 6th June, 2003, and a decision is pending.

On 22nd January, 2003, Akamai filed a patent infringement suit against Cable & Wireless Internet Services,
Inc. in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, alleging that the Cable & Wireless content
delivery service infringes a recently-issued patent owned by Akamai. Upon motion by Cable & Wireless Internet
Services, Inc. the case was transferred to the District Court for the District of Massachusetts.

On 22nd April, 2003, Akamai filed a patent infringement suit against Cable & Wireless Internet Services,
Inc. in the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that the Cable & Wireless content delivery
service infringes a patent issued to Akamai that same day. Akamai has not yet effected service of the complaint in
this case.

On 29th August, 2002, Teknowledge Corporation (Teknowledge) filed a patent infringement suit against
Cable & Wireless Internet Services, Inc., Akamai, and Inktomi Corporation in the US District Court for the
District of Delaware, alleging that the content delivery service of each defendant infringes a patent owned by
Teknowledge. Upon motion by Cable & Wireless Internet Services, Inc. the case was transferred to the District
Court for the Northern District of California.


-----

Cable & Wireless Internet Services, Inc. believes that it has meritorious defences to the outstanding claims
asserted in these cases and intends to vigorously defend itself in these cases. The plaintiffs have elected not to
specify damages in their claims and, accordingly, it is not possible to set out the quantum of these claims.

Class actions against Digital Island, Inc. in connection with its initial public offering

In August 2001, Digital Island became aware that two purported shareholder class action lawsuits were filed
in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York naming Digital Island as a defendant along with
certain of its present and former officers and Directors and alleging violations of certain sections of the Securities
Act 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act 1934.

The actions (which now include a third suit making virtually identical claims and allegations) allege that the
Registration Statement and Prospectus through which Digital Island conducted its initial public offering (IPO) in
June 1999 was false and misleading because it failed to disclose, amongst other things, that:

(i) the underwriters of the IPO allegedly had solicited and received excessive and undisclosed
commissions from certain investors in exchange for which the underwriters allocated to those
investors material portions of the restricted number of Digital Island shares issued in connection with
the IPO; and

(ii) the underwriters allegedly had entered into agreements with customers whereby the underwriters
agreed to allocate Digital Island shares to those customers in the IPO in exchange for which the
customers agreed to purchase additional Digital Island shares in the after market at pre-determined
prices.

On 15th July, 2002, Cable & Wireless Internet Services, Inc. moved to dismiss all claims against it. On 19th
February, 2003, the Court denied the motion to dismiss.

Cable & Wireless Internet Services, Inc. is now engaged in settlement discussions with the plaintiffs.
Notwithstanding this, Cable & Wireless Internet Services, Inc. believes that it has meritorious defences to these
claims and, should the settlement discussions prove unsuccessful, intends to vigorously defend itself in any such
litigation. The plaintiffs have elected not to specify damages in their claims and, accordingly, it is not possible to
set out the quantum of these claims.

Class action securities litigation against Digital Island, Inc., Cable & Wireless and others

Digital Island, Cable and Wireless plc, Dali Acquisition Corp. (Dali) (a former subsidiary of Cable &
Wireless), and certain of the then present and former Directors of Digital Island, have been named as defendants
in six separate putative class action lawsuits alleging various claims arising out of Cable & Wireless’ acquisition
of Digital Island in August 2001. Three of the lawsuits were filed in the US District Court for the District of
Delaware and three were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The three federal lawsuits were consolidated
into a single case, and, while the plaintiffs’ motion to consolidate the three state cases was granted on 24th April,
2002, the plaintiffs have yet to file a consolidated, amended complaint.

The federal suit alleged that the defendants violated federal securities laws by failing to disclose on a timely
basis that Digital Island had entered into certain business agreements with Bloomberg, L.P., and Major League
Baseball. It further alleged that compensation agreements with certain officers and/or Directors of the company
violated the federal securities ‘all-holders’ rule. One state lawsuit alleged violations of Delaware law based upon
similar allegations.

The other two state lawsuits alleged various violations of Delaware law against the same corporate
defendants and the present and former Digital Island Directors, including that they failed to disclose all material
facts relating to Digital Island’s relationship with Microsoft, and that they failed to obtain a fair price for Digital
Island shares.

On 10th September, 2002, a federal judge granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss the federal lawsuits
with prejudice. Plaintiffs have appealed the decision to the US Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.
Cable & Wireless believes that it and its subsidiaries have meritorious defences to the claims asserted in these
lawsuits, and intends to continue to vigorously defend itself in that litigation as well should the plaintiffs pursue
those claims. The plaintiffs have elected not to specify damages in their claims and, accordingly, it is not possible
to set out the quantum of these claims.

Litigation with Cibertec International, S.A. and Inversiones Kamasu, S.A.

Cibertec International, S.A. and Inversiones Kamasu, S.A. initiated proceedings against Cable & Wireless
Panama, S.A. and Cable and Wireless (CALA Management Services) Limited in Panama on 29th October, 1999.
The claim is for approximately US$125 million and alleges breach of contract. On 18th November, 2002, the
Panamanian Circuit Court handed down a decision against Cable & Wireless Panama, S.A. awarding damages of
US$67,255,000, including moral damages and costs. The Court decided that Cable & Wireless Panama, S.A. had
failed to maintain in sufficient confidence certain of the proprietary information of the plaintiffs.

Cable & Wireless Panama, S.A. appealed the judgement on 3rd December, 2002 and intends to pursue this
appeal vigorously. Pending the resolution of its appeal, Cable & Wireless Panama, S.A. is not obliged to pay, and
has not paid, any of the awards against it.

Claim against the Minister of Finance and Economy

On 16th December, 2002, a complaint was filed at the Supreme Court of Justice of Panama against the
Minister of Finance and Economy in Panama alleging that the Operating Agreement executed between Cable and
Wireless (CALA Management Services) Limited and INTEL, S.A. (now Cable & Wireless Panama, S.A.) as part
of the privatisation agreements was null and void ab initio, on the grounds that it had not been published in the
Official Gazette in Panama.

On 21st March, 2003, the Court admitted the claim against the Minister of Finance and Economy.

Panamanian counsel consider this claim to be without merit and none of Cable and Wireless plc, Cable &
Wireless Panama, S.A. or Cable and Wireless (CALA Management Services) Limited are parties to the
complaint. However, if the complaint were to be successful and the Operating Agreement declared null and void,
then the complainants could file a complaint against Cable and Wireless (CALA Management Services) Limited
requiring the return of all management fees collected under the agreement since its execution. This would amount
to approximately £60 million. In the event that this complaint is successful, Cable & Wireless and its subsidiaries
intend to vigorously pursue any legal recourse available to them.

Claim by Caribtel (Caribbean) Limited

On 9th May, 2003, Caribtel (Caribbean) Limited, a telecommunications operator specialising in calling
cards, filed a suit against Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited in the Supreme Court of Judicature of Jamaica.
Caribtel has alleged that Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited wrongfully disconnected Caribtel’s local access
telephone services, resulting in a breach of contract and a violation of the Jamaican Fair Competition Act and the
Telecommunications Act. Caribtel is claiming US$50 million of lost income to its pre-paid local access calling
card business for the period from 25th April, 2003 to 25th April, 2006. Caribtel has also claimed aggravated
and/or exemplary damages of Jamaica $300 million (approximately £2.94 million) and is seeking injunctive relief
to have Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited reinstate Caribtel’s local access telephone service.

On 22nd May, 2003, Caribtel presented a petition for injunctive relief before the Supreme Court of Jamaica
requesting that Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited be required to reinstate Caribtel’s local access telephone
service; be restrained from disconnecting any other telecommunications facility currently supplied to Caribtel’s
business premises until trial; and be prevented from calling on a prior bank guarantee that Caribtel had provided
to Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited in conjunction with a settlement agreement entered into between the parties
in February 2003 relating to breaches of contract by Caribtel in December 2002. The injunctions were not granted
by the court. However, Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited gave an undertaking that it would not disconnect the
direct internet access facility pending a hearing scheduled for 2nd June, 2003.

Prior to the hearing of 2nd June, 2003, Caribtel approached Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited with a view
to arriving at a settlement. The parties entered into negotiations as a result of which the matter was taken off the
court list by consent of both parties. The parties were unable to arrive at a settlement due to the fact that Caribtel
has since opted not to execute the proposed settlement agreement. In light of these developments, Cable &
Wireless Jamaica Limited has instructed its attorneys to relist the matter for hearing in Court. Management
intends to contest the case vigorously and is confident that Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited will successfully
prove that Caribtel had been operating in flagrant breach of contract and that Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited
was therefore entitled to terminate the contract and disconnect the relevant service.

Arbitration between Tilts Communications A/S/Cable and Wireless plc/Sonera OY and Republic of Latvia/
Lattelekom SIA

In September 2001, Cable and Wireless plc was joined as a party to an arbitration in connection with its
former participation with Sonera OY (Sonera) in the joint venture Tilts Communications A/S (Tilts). Through
Tilts, Cable and Wireless plc and Sonera purchased a 49 per cent. shareholding in a Latvian telecommunications
company, Lattelekom SIA (Lattelekom) in 1994. Cable and Wireless plc sold its interest in Tilts to Sonera in
June 1998.

Tilts commenced arbitration proceedings in August 2000 against the Republic of Latvia alleging a number
of breaches of an agreement signed in 1994 by Tilts, Lattelekom and the Republic of Latvia (the Umbrella
Agreement). Tilts claims a total of approximately LVL87.6 million (approximately £95 million) from the
Republic of Latvia as compensation for, amongst other things, losses sustained as a consequence of the
shortening of the twenty year exclusivity period granted to Lattelekom as the provider of fixed line
telecommunications services.

The Republic of Latvia has asserted nine counterclaims for a total of approximately LVL599.5 million
(approximately £656 million) against Tilts, alleging that Tilts has failed to comply with various obligations it
assumed under the Umbrella Agreement including (i) to digitalise and otherwise improve Lattelekom’s network
in accordance with its contractual commitments, (ii) to meet certain quality of service and network performance
commitments, and (iii) to procure that Sonera sell its shares in GSM operator Latvijas Mobilais Telefons to
Lattelekom. Tilts considers that the counterclaims asserted by the Republic of Latvia are unfounded.

Cable and Wireless plc was joined as a party to the arbitration by the Republic of Latvia because it
(and Sonera) guaranteed the performance by Tilts of its obligations under the Umbrella Agreement to the
Republic of Latvia by performance and parental guarantees. However, as part of the arrangements relating to
Sonera’s purchase of Cable and Wireless plc’s shares in Tilts, Sonera provided Cable and Wireless plc with an
indemnity for any liability incurred by Cable and Wireless plc under these guarantees. Provided Sonera honours
its obligations under the indemnity, Cable and Wireless plc will not be exposed to any liability under these
guarantees. Cable and Wireless plc has taken legal advice. Based on this advice, Cable and Wireless plc believes
that the indemnity is binding. In addition, Sonera provided Cable and Wireless plc with a letter dated
11th December, 2001, confirming that in its view all liabilities, costs and expenses incurred by Cable and
Wireless plc in connection with the arbitration fell within the scope of the indemnity. Following the acquisition of
Sonera in 2002, the successor entity to Sonera, TeliaSonera, provided Cable and Wireless plc with a further letter
dated 23rd February, 2003, acknowledging Sonera’s obligations under the indemnity and stating that
TeliaSonera’s acquisition of Sonera did not alter the validity of the confirmations given by Sonera in its
earlier letter of 11th December, 2001.

Other than the above, there are no pending legal or regulatory proceedings against the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, which the Company believes will if determined adversely to the Group have a material adverse
effect on the Group’s liquidity or results of operations.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto
included elsewhere in this document (the Financial Statements). These financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with UK GAAP.

OVERVIEW

The analysis and commentary included in this Operating and Financial Review is based on the Group’s
structure and reflects the manner in which the business was organised and managed during the three years ended
31st March, 2003.

In June 2003, the Company announced that the Group will withdraw from the United States, take steps
radically to improve the unsatisfactory results in the United Kingdom and build upon its strong positions in
national telecommunications companies round the world. To simplify the management of the business, Cable &
Wireless now has a country-based structure.

Prior to this reorganisation, Cable & Wireless was organised into two business divisions: Cable & Wireless
Global and Cable & Wireless Regional. Cable & Wireless Global’s main operations and subsidiaries were in the
United Kingdom, Europe, the United States and Japan delivering IP, data and voice solutions to wholesale
(Service Provider) and business customers. Business customers were divided into two customer segments:
Enterprise, comprising major corporate customers, and Business Markets, comprising SME and retail voice
customers. Cable & Wireless Regional comprised operations in the Caribbean, Panama, Macau, the Middle East
and the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans providing a range of telecommunications services to businesses and
consumers.

Current geographical financial data for Cable & Wireless Global included in this Operating and Financial
Review are based on management’s estimates of the allocation of turnover and operating profit or loss
attributable to a given geographical region that was included within the business of Cable & Wireless Global.
However, as announced, Cable & Wireless intends to focus its business around the key geographical regions in
which it operates and will track and report results on that basis. Consequently, in the future, the geographical
breakdown of the Group’s results for those portions of its business that used to be part of Cable & Wireless
Global, may not be entirely comparable to the results by geography disclosed when Cable & Wireless reported
results by Cable & Wireless Global (and within Cable & Wireless Global: Wholesale, Enterprise and Business
Markets) and Cable & Wireless Regional.

Trading conditions in the telecommunications markets have remained challenging in 2003. In the United
Kingdom, continental Europe, the United States and Japan, the trading market remains intensely competitive,
with overcapacity in many areas resulting in downward pricing pressure. In the United Kingdom, there has been a
significant reduction in the volume of national interconnect business as other carriers migrate to their own
networks.

A deterioration in Cable & Wireless Global’s business performance has resulted in fixed asset and goodwill
impairment charges as forecast performance has been revised downwards. In September 2002, fixed assets were
impaired by £787 million and goodwill of £2,713 million was written off. This goodwill write off largely related
to the UK corporate, IP and wholesale businesses acquired as part of the Cable & Wireless Communications’
restructuring in May 2000. In March 2003, fixed assets were further impaired by an additional £1,479 million and
goodwill by an additional £12 million. These impairment charges mean that the Group’s depreciation charge will
be significantly lower in 2004.

As part of the Group’s reorganisation, Cable & Wireless may incur additional costs as the Group implements
the new strategy and determines the steps necessary to reorganise the business. Cable & Wireless cannot
predetermine what these costs are likely to be. It is possible, however, given the scope of the intended
reorganisation, that further significant exceptional charges could be incurred in 2004.

In Cable & Wireless Regional, liberalisation in many of the markets has increased competition, particularly
in mobile, international and local data and IP services.

During 2003, the phased liberalisation processes in Panama and Jamaica concluded with the opening of all
market sectors to competition in January and March 2003 respectively.

The following sections set out, for each of the three years ended 31st March, 2003, turnover, operating costs
and operating profit or loss of the Group and of the divisions Cable & Wireless Global and Cable & Wireless
Regional. The analysis of turnover between Cable & Wireless Global and Cable & Wireless Regional is provided


-----

as an indication of the sources of growth of the Group’s businesses. The Group’s operations are all considered to
fall into one class of business, namely telecommunications.

1 On 27th March, 2003, the Urgent Issues Task Force of the ASB issued UITF Abstract 36, ‘Contracts for sales of capacity’. UITF 36 is
applicable for accounting periods ending on or after 30th June, 2003 although early adoption is encouraged. The Company has adopted
UITF 36 for the year ended 31st March, 2003 and adjusted 2002 and 2001 comparative figures to reflect the required retrospective
application of the UITF to those periods. The impact of adopting UITF 36 is set out in Note 4 to the Financial Statements. Cable &
Wireless’ revised accounting policy for Capacity Sales is set out in New UK Accounting Standards Adopted.
2 In May 2002, Cable & Wireless announced its intention to restructure its US business and, as part of this restructuring, announced the
disposal of the US retail voice and data customer bases in September 2002. Under FRS 3 – ‘Reporting Financial Performance’, these
businesses have been classified as discontinued. Comparatives for the years ended 31st March, 2002 and 31st March, 2001 have been
adjusted accordingly. In November 2002, Cable & Wireless announced its withdrawal from the US and continental Europe domestic
markets apart from the provision of services to multinational Enterprise and wholesale customers. The results of these operations are
included within continuing operations as the restructuring does not meet all of the FRS3 criteria for discontinued operations.


-----

Year ended 31st March, 2003 compared with year ended 31st March, 2002

Cable & Wireless recorded a total operating loss of £6,000 million in 2003, compared with £4,910 million in
2002. Exceptional costs of £5,548 million were charged in 2003 reflecting the difficult trading conditions in the
telecommunications sector, particularly the markets in which Cable & Wireless Global operates. Goodwill of
£2,713 million was written off at 30th September, 2002 and fixed assets were impaired by a further £787 million.
Additional impairment charges of £1,491 million were recognised at 31st March, 2003 as the Group’s assessment
of future performance was again revised downwards, together with a £115 million writedown of redundant fixed
assets.

Operating losses before exceptionals at £452 million in 2003 were £332 million lower than in 2002. There
was a £773 million reduction in the charge for depreciation and amortisation before exceptionals reflecting the
lower fixed asset base following asset impairments in March and September 2002. Operating profit in continuing
operations, before depreciation, amortisation and exceptionals, deteriorated. The UK operating profit before
depreciation, amortisation and exceptionals, at £110 million in 2003 was £217 million lower than 2002 reflecting
a 23 per cent. decrease in wholesale revenues and a change in mix towards lower margin products, together with
reduced revenues from business customers. US operating losses in the continuing business, before depreciation,
amortisation and exceptionals, were £56 million higher than in 2002 at £211 million in 2003.

Cable & Wireless Regional’s operating profit before exceptional items and including joint ventures and
associates at £505 million in 2003 was £15 million lower than 2002. At constant exchange rates operating profit
before exceptional items increased by approximately 5 per cent.

Year ended 31st March, 2002 compared with year ended 31st March, 2001

Cable & Wireless recorded an operating loss of £4,910 million in 2002 compared with £268 million in 2001.
The 2002 operating loss included the write down of certain fixed assets of £1,909 million and goodwill of
£2,007 million to their recoverable values, and costs relating mainly to the withdrawal from certain products and
businesses of £210 million. The 2001 operating loss included a fixed asset impairment charge of £444 million
against certain network assets employed in the Group’s switched circuit voice business.

The 2002 loss before tax was £4,549 million compared with a profit of £3,516 million in 2001. The loss
before tax in 2002 included a £904 million write down of investments held in ntl, CMGI and PCCW Limited.
This write down was offset by a profit on the sale of Optus of £1,057 million. Profit before tax in 2001 included a
£4,311 million profit on the disposal of the HKT and ConsumerCo businesses, a charge of £530 million for the
fundamental reorganisation of the Group’s activities and a charge of £43 million for the write down of certain
fixed asset investments.

In 2002, there was an operating loss before exceptional items of £784 million compared with an operating
profit before exceptional items of £176 million in 2001. Excluding exceptional items, Cable & Wireless Global
recorded operating losses of £1,092 million in 2002 reflecting intense competition in the market and continued
investment spend. In addition, the new DI and Exodus businesses recorded an operating loss before exceptional
items of £195 million.

Cable & Wireless Regional’s operating profit before exceptional items increased by £35 million, or
7 per cent., from £485 million in 2001 to £520 million in 2002.

Year ended 31st March, 2003 compared with year ended 31st March, 2002

Group turnover at £4,391 million in 2003 was £1,357 million, or 24 per cent., lower than in 2002 primarily
due to discontinued operations in Australia and the United States.


-----

Turnover from continuing operations was £456 million, or 10 per cent., lower in 2003 compared with 2002,
reflecting excess capacity and downward pricing pressure in Cable & Wireless Global’s trading environment.

Turnover in Cable & Wireless Global at £2,867 million was £404 million lower in 2003 compared with
2002. UK revenues were £347 million lower in 2003 compared with 2002. Reductions in wholesale and business
revenues, of £215 million and £187 million lower than 2002 respectively, were only partly offset by a £55 million
increase in Enterprise.

The reduction in UK wholesale revenues reflected in part the migration of national interconnect business to
carriers’ own networks and a change in the mix of international voice traffic, from mobile to fixed, which
generates lower revenue per minute.

The reduction in UK Business revenues compared with 2002 reflected continued pricing pressure and the
impact of a 2002 management decision to focus on high margin services with growth potential.

The increase in Enterprise revenues was partly due to a focus on higher value managed services and away
from more commoditised products, together with new contract wins and increased business with existing clients.

Cable & Wireless Regional reported a £55 million, or 4 per cent., decrease in revenues in 2003 compared
with 2002. Many of Cable & Wireless Regional’s revenues and costs arise in currencies that are linked to the
US dollar. As a consequence, the results were affected by an 8 per cent. devaluation in the US dollar against
sterling and a 14 per cent. devaluation in the Jamaica dollar. At constant exchange rates, Cable & Wireless
Regional’s revenue increased by 5 per cent. in 2003 compared with 2002. The increase reflected the inclusion of
Cable & Wireless Guernsey for the 10 months since its acquisition, together with underlying revenue growth.
Revenue growth was driven by further increases in mobile revenues and continued demand for IP and data
services, underpinned by growth in domestic voice business.

Year ended 31st March, 2002 compared with 31st March, 2001

Group turnover was £5,748 million in 2002 compared with £7,851 million in 2001. The reduction in Group
turnover during these periods primarily relates to the disposal of HKT and the disposal of CWC ConsumerCo.

Turnover of £4,703 million from continuing businesses in 2002 was broadly in line with 2001.

Turnover from Cable & Wireless Global at £3,271 million was £91 million lower in 2002 compared with
2001: decreases in Business Markets, £133 million, and Service Providers, £163 million, were only partly offset
by a £38 million increase in Enterprise revenue and £167 million of revenue from the new DI and Exodus
businesses. The decreased revenues from Business Markets and Service Providers reflected weak market
conditions and a decision by Cable & Wireless to move away from lower margin business.

Cable & Wireless Regional turnover at £1,466 million was £33 million higher in 2002 than 2001. A £62
million decrease due to the disposal of the Mitratel business in Indonesia in 2002, was more than offset by
increases in other regions. The underlying growth in 2002 reflected the continuing success of the business in
rebalancing away from international towards domestic revenue, growth in the mobile and IP and data markets and
the development of new businesses.

Year ended 31st March, 2003 compared with year ended 31st March, 2002

Operating costs before depreciation, amortisation and exceptional items at £4,057 million in 2003 were
£956 million or 19 per cent. lower than in 2002.

Excluding discontinued operations, costs before depreciation, amortisation and exceptional items of
£3,818 million in 2003 were £107 million lower than in 2002. Lower outpayments and network costs were partly
offset by increases in all other categories largely due to the inclusion of a full year’s costs for the DI and Exodus
businesses. 2002 included the results of DI for nine and a half months and Exodus for two months.

Outpayments and network costs for continuing operations were £2,274 million in 2003, £342 million or
13 per cent. lower than in 2002, principally reflecting a £345 million reduction in such costs for Cable & Wireless
Global. This reduction was largely due to lower volumes of voice traffic in the United Kingdom, reduced traffic
in the United States and the benefit of network streamlining in the United Kingdom, Japan and the United States.

Cable & Wireless Regional’s outpayments and network costs at £443 million in 2003 were in line with 2002.
At constant exchange rates, there was an underlying increase in outpayments and network costs of 13 per cent.
mainly due to increased volumes and third party terminations, particularly in mobile and in fixed to mobile traffic,
network expansion and customer acquisition costs, including mobile handset subsidies.

Staff costs for continuing operations were £47 million, or 6 per cent., higher in 2003 compared with 2002. In
Cable & Wireless Global, increased costs in the United States due to the inclusion of a full year’s results for DI
and Exodus offset the benefit of reductions elsewhere due to lower headcount. Year end headcount in
Cable & Wireless Global was 10,749 at 31st March, 2003 compared with 12,543 at 31st March, 2002.

Staff costs in Cable & Wireless Regional were £11 million lower in 2003 compared with 2002, or 3 per cent.
higher at constant exchange rates. There was an 11 per cent. reduction in headcount, from 11,465 to 10,193, the
full benefit of which will be recognised in future years.

Property costs for continuing operations at £278 million were £65 million higher in 2003 compared with
2002. Property costs in Cable & Wireless Global were £64 million higher, mainly reflecting the inclusion of a full
year’s costs for the DI and Exodus businesses.

Administration and other costs for continuing operations were £123 million higher in 2003 compared with
2002. This increase reflected the inclusion of a full year’s costs for the DI and Exodus businesses together with
the effect in 2002 of a release of bad debt provisions raised in prior years.

Year ended 31st March, 2002 compared with year ended 31st March, 2001

Operating costs before depreciation, amortisation and exceptional items were £1,181 million, or 19 per cent.,
lower in 2002 than 2001. Excluding discontinued operations, there was an underlying increase in operating costs
before depreciation, amortisation and exceptional items of £194 million, or 5 per cent., during 2002 compared
with 2001, of which £241 million was due to the acquisition of DI and Exodus businesses.

Outpayment and network costs in continuing operations were £2,616 million in 2002, £38 million higher
than in 2001. In Cable & Wireless Global, a £71 million increase in outpayments and network costs in 2002
compared with 2001 relating to the new DI and Exodus businesses, was more than offset by a 7 per cent.
reduction in the rest of Cable & Wireless Global mainly reflecting lower volumes of voice traffic. In Cable &
Wireless Regional, outpayments and network costs were £47 million higher in 2002 than in 2001, up 9 per cent.
in constant currency terms principally due to rapid growth in the competitive mobile markets in Jamaica and
Macau.

Staff costs for continuing operations were £16 million higher in 2002 compared with 2001 and included
£110 million in respect of the new DI and Exodus businesses. Staff costs in the rest of Cable & Wireless Global
were £75 million lower where a staff reduction programme reduced headcount by over 8,000 from a peak of
18,600 in December 2000. Staff costs in Cable & Wireless Regional were £10 million lower in 2002 compared
with 2001, again reflecting headcount reductions and the impact of the disposal of Mitratel Indonesia.

Year ended 31st March, 2003 compared with year ended 31st March, 2002

Depreciation before exceptional items at £735 million in 2003 was £337 million lower than in 2002. The
£201 million decrease in depreciation before exceptional items in continuing operations in 2003 compared with
2002 reflected the impact of a lower fixed base following asset impairments in March and September 2002.

Year ended 31st March, 2002 compared with year ended 31st March, 2001

Depreciation before exceptional items at £1,072 million in 2002 was £54 million lower than in 2001. The
increase in depreciation before exceptional items in continuing businesses of £263 million was primarily due to a
£256 million increase in Cable & Wireless Global of which £35 million related to the new DI and Exodus
businesses. The underlying increase of £221 million reflected the impact of 2001 capital expenditure, including
the roll out of the global IP backbone.

Year ended 31st March, 2003 compared with year ended 31st March, 2002

Goodwill amortisation of £126 million in 2003 was £436 million lower than in 2002. The reduction reflected
lower goodwill carried on the balance sheet in 2003 following the impairments booked in March and September
2002. As a result of these impairments, substantially all goodwill of the Group had been fully written off by the
year end.

Year ended 31st March, 2002 compared with year ended 31st March, 2001

Goodwill amortisation before exceptionals at £562 million was £93 million higher than in 2001. The
increase was largely due to the acquisition of the DI and Exodus businesses, £59 million, and a full year’s charge
for 2001 acquisitions.

Year ended 31st March, 2003 compared with year ended 31st March, 2002

Cable & Wireless Regional recorded a £2 million reduction in the share of operating profits in joint ventures
and associates. At constant exchange rates, there was underlying growth of 4 per cent. compared with 2002.


-----

In December 2002, as part of the Initial Public Offering of shares in the Group’s Singapore associate, Mobile
One Limited, Cable & Wireless sold 60 per cent. of its stake in that company, realising a profit of £54 million
before minority interests.

The remaining Cable & Wireless shareholding in Mobile One is now classified as a trade investment.

Year ended 31st March, 2002 compared with year ended 31st March, 2001

Cable & Wireless’ share of operating profits in joint ventures and associates was £115 million in 2002,
compared with £114 million in 2001. A reduction due to a number of disposals, including (by virtue of the sale of
Cable & Wireless’ interest in Optus) Southern Cross (a submarine cable system linking Australia, New Zealand,
Fiji, Hawaii and the US Mainland), were offset by increased profits in 2002 from the Group’s interests in the
Caribbean, Singapore and Bahrain.

Year ended 31st March, 2003 compared with year ended 31st March, 2002

Difficult trading conditions in Cable & Wireless Global’s markets led to further fixed asset and goodwill
impairment charges in 2003 as forecast revenues were revised downwards and the Group’s cost of capital
increased.

In September 2002, fixed assets were impaired by £787 million and the remaining goodwill of the Group
was substantially written off. These impairments arose as estimates of future revenues were revised downwards.
The goodwill write-off largely related to CWC DataCo acquired as part of the Cable & Wireless Communications
restructuring in May 2000.

At 31st March, 2003, a further fixed asset impairment charge of £1,594 million arose. Continued problems in
the market led to revenue forecasts being further reduced.

Other exceptional operating costs of £442 million mainly related to the costs of exiting and restructuring
primarily in the US business.

Year ended 31st March, 2002 compared with year ended 31st March, 2001

Fixed assets in Cable & Wireless Global were written down by £1,631 million in 2002, principally relating
to redundant cables and network assets. Cable & Wireless Regional wrote down £191 million of fixed assets,
mainly relating to TDMA mobile network assets. In 2001, Cable & Wireless Global recorded an impairment
charge of £353 million relating to network and assets in its switched circuit voice business.

Exceptional goodwill amortisation in 2002 represents a £2,007 million impairment charge to eliminate
unamortised goodwill on the US MCI acquisition, £697 million, and the European IP acquisitions, £190 million,
together with the partial writedown of goodwill on the CWC DataCo acquisition, £996 million, and the Cable &
Wireless IDC acquisition, £124 million.

The other exceptional operating costs in 2002 mainly related to the costs of exiting certain products and
businesses.

In 2003, a loss on disposal of operations of £231 million which relates to the termination of the US voice
retail business was partly offset by a release of accrued costs relating to disposals in previous years.

Profit on disposals of operations in 2002 represented a £1,057 million profit on the sale of the Group’s 52.5
per cent. investment in Optus. In 2001, Cable & Wireless recorded a net profit of £4,311 million on the sale of its
interests in HKT and CWC ConsumerCo. Early redemption penalties on the sale of CWC ConsumerCo. of
£110 million are reported in net interest.

Fundamental reorganisation provisions

The fundamental reorganisation charge booked in the year ended 31st March, 2001 of £530 million included
provisions of £239 million in respect of the consequences of the announcement made in March 2001 regarding
the intention to cut staff numbers by at least 4,000 heads in Cable & Wireless Global and 2,485 heads in Cable &
Wireless Regional and reduce operating costs. The provision at 31st March, 2001 included redundancy provisions
of £138 million and provisions for exiting surplus properties of £68 million.

Year ended 31st March, 2003 compared with year ended 31st March, 2002

A tax charge of £36 million arose in 2003 on the loss before tax of £6,373 million. The Group continued to
generate tax losses in 2003 for which no immediate benefit was recognised as realisation of the benefit is not
considered probable. These tax losses have been carried forward to future periods. The negative tax rate of 0.6 per
cent. in 2003 is lower than the negative tax rate of 6.8 per cent. for 2002, primarily because the tax charge on
exceptional items is lower than 2002 due to there being no material disposals of investments in 2003. The tax
charge on exceptional items in 2002 could not be reduced by surplus tax losses, as they arose in different
jurisdictions. As with 2002, in the United Kingdom, tax relief is denied on certain costs and provisions, including
the amortisation and write down of goodwill and fixed asset write-downs.

Year ended 31st March, 2002 compared with year ended 31st March, 2001

Cable & Wireless recorded a tax charge of £311 million in 2002 despite incurring pre-tax losses of £4,549
million. The movement in the effective tax rate from 14.8 per cent. in 2001 to negative 6.8 per cent. in 2002 is
primarily because, in the United Kingdom, tax relief is denied on certain costs and provisions, including the
amortisation and write down of goodwill and fixed asset write-downs which were incurred in 2002. In addition,
the Group has carried tax losses forward to future periods, for which no immediate tax benefit was recognised as
realisation of the benefit is not considered probable.

Year ended 31st March, 2003 compared with year ended 31st March, 2002

Operating losses were £1,527 million higher in 2003 compared with 2002.

UK operating losses rose by £1,800 million as further fixed asset and goodwill impairment charges were
recognised. UK operating losses before exceptional items at £365 million in 2003 were £51 million higher than in
2002. The benefit of reduced charges for depreciation and goodwill amortisation in 2003, following asset
impairments in March and September 2002, were offset by a £217 million reduction in the UK business’
operating profit before exceptionals, depreciation and amortisation to £110 million in 2003. This reduction was
largely due to a poor business performance, particularly in the wholesale markets.

Cable & Wireless America’s operating losses at £1,681 million in 2003 were £199 million lower than in
2002. At constant exchange rates there was an underlying decrease of 4 per cent. Decreased charges in 2003 for
asset impairments and the benefit of reduced charges for depreciation and amortisation more than offset higher
losses in underlying business.

In Continental Europe, operating losses at £367 million in 2003 were £176 million or 32 per cent. lower than
in 2002. This decrease was largely due to the non-recurrence of a £190 million goodwill impairment charge in
2002.

In Japan, operating losses at £265 million in 2003 were £102 million or 63 per cent. higher than in 2002
mainly due to increased charges for asset impairment and lower revenues, particularly in wholesale.


-----

Year ended 31st March, 2002 compared with year ended 31st March, 2001

Operating losses at £4,721 million in 2002 were £3,982 million higher than in 2001, of which £1,278 million
was attributable to increased fixed asset impairment charges and £1,794 million to goodwill write-downs. Fixed
asset impairment charges in 2002 mainly related to the write-down of cables and fibres where the Group’s
ownership is in excess of predicted future traffic levels and a write-down of the global network based upon net
recoverable values.

In the United Kingdom, operating losses at £2,135 million in 2002 were £1,437 million higher than in 2001.
A £997 million charge for goodwill impairment was recognised in 2002 relating to the CWC DataCo acquisition
and fixed asset impairment charges were £311 million higher in 2002 than in 2001.

Cable & Wireless America recorded operating losses in 2002 of £1,880 million compared with an operating
profit of £2 million in 2001. The loss in 2002 was primarily attributable to fixed asset and goodwill impairment
charges of £1,206 million and losses of £239 million for the newly acquired DI and Exodus businesses.

In Continental Europe, operating losses at £543 million in 2002 were £379 million higher than in 2001, of
which £401 million related to fixed asset and goodwill impairment charges in 2002.

Japan recorded operating losses of £163 million in 2002 compared with an operating profit of £121 million
in 2001. Operating losses in 2002 included £157 million related to fixed asset and goodwill impairment charges.

Year ended 31st March, 2003 compared with year ended 31st March, 2002

Turnover was 12 per cent. lower in 2003 compared with 2002 as a result of weak market conditions in the
wholesale market and the impact of a deliberate decision by Cable & Wireless in 2002 to withdraw from
the provision of lower margin products to Business customers. Revenue in the Enterprise segment grew by
21 per cent. in 2003, including the benefit of new contract wins and expansion of contracts with existing
customers.

Year ended 31st March, 2002 compared with year ended 31st March, 2001

Turnover at £3,271 million in 2002 was £91 million or 3 per cent. lower than in 2001 with decreases in
Service Provider and Business revenues of £163 million and £133 million respectively, only partly offset by a
£38 million increase in Enterprise revenues and £167 million of revenues from the new DI and Exodus
businesses. The decrease in Service Provider revenues mainly reflected lower voice revenues, due to declining
prices, customer bankruptcies and a decision to move away from lower margin business.

Year ended 31st March, 2003 compared with year ended 31st March, 2002

Operating costs before depreciation, amortisation and exceptional items in Cable & Wireless Global were
£85 million lower in 2003 compared with 2002. A £345 million reduction in outpayments and network costs was
offset by increases in all other cost categories largely due to the inclusion of a full year’s costs for the DI and
Exodus businesses. The reduction in outpayments and network costs was mainly attributable to lower volumes of


-----

voice traffic in the United Kingdom, reduced traffic in the United States and network streamlining in the
United Kingdom, Japan and the United States.

Year ended 31st March, 2002 compared with year ended 31st March, 2001

Operating costs before depreciation, amortisation and exceptionals at £3,072 million in 2002 were
£49 million or 2 per cent. higher than in 2001. An increase of £241 million due to the newly acquired DI and
Exodus businesses was partly offset by lower outpayments and network costs in the rest of Cable & Wireless
Global, mainly reflecting lower volumes of voice traffic, and lower staff costs as headcount was reduced.

Year ended 31st March, 2003 compared with year ended 31st March, 2002

Cable & Wireless Regional’s operating profit at £470 million in 2003 was £141 million or 43 per cent.
higher than in 2002 largely due to exceptional asset impairment charges in 2002. Many of the territories in which
Cable & Wireless Regional operates have currencies that are linked directly or indirectly to the US dollar. As a
consequence, an 8 per cent. strengthening of sterling against the US dollar and a 14 per cent. strengthening
against the Jamaica dollar had a significant effect on Cable & Wireless Regional’s reported results. At constant
exchange rates operating profit in 2003 was 62 per cent. higher than in 2002.

In the Caribbean, operating profit at £234 million in 2003 was £116 million or 98 per cent. higher than 2002.
This increase was largely attributable to the non-recurrence of a £172 million impairment charge to write down
network and TDMA mobile assets in 2002, partly offset by £20 million of exceptional costs relating to
reorganisation and redundancy incurred in 2003. Operating profit before exceptional items in the Caribbean at
£254 million in 2003 was £36 million or 12 per cent. lower than in 2002. At constant exchange rates 2003


-----

operating profit before exceptional items in the Caribbean was 5 per cent. lower. A 7 per cent. increase in costs at
constant exchange rates was partly offset by a 1 per cent. increase in revenues and a reduced depreciation charge.

In Panama, operating profit at £77 million in 2003 was £15 million or 24 per cent. higher than in 2002. At
constant exchange rates there was a 34 per cent. increase in operating profit in 2003 compared with 2002. This
increase was largely attributable to lower outpayments, headcount savings and reduced depreciation and
exceptional charges.

Macau’s operating profit at £42 million in 2003 was £4 million or 11 per cent. higher than in 2002. At
constant exchange rates there was a 16 per cent. increase in operating profit. This increase reflected a good
performance in data and IP, driven by growing demand for broadband services and other value added internet
services, together with the launch of services in Singapore and Hong Kong.

Rest of World delivered operating profit of £117 million in 2003, £6 million or 5 per cent. higher than in
2002. At constant exchange rates, operating profit in 2003 was 13 per cent. higher than in 2002. A good
performance in the Maldives and Bahrain and the inclusion of 10 months’ activity for Cable & Wireless
Guernsey were offset by mixed performances in Yemen and the smaller territories.

Year ended 31st March, 2002 compared with year ended 31st March, 2001

Cable & Wireless Regional’s operating profit at £329 million in 2002 was £156 million or 32 per cent. lower
than in 2001. This decrease was mainly attributable to a £191 million impairment charge in 2002 to write off
network and TDMA mobile assets.

In the Caribbean, operating profit at £118 million in 2002 was £157 million lower than in 2001, primarily
due to a £172 million impairment charge in 2002 to write down network and TDMA mobile assets. Before
exceptional items, operating profit in 2002 was £15 million higher than in 2001 up 5 per cent. in underlying
constant currency terms. The softening of margins in Jamaica reflecting rapid growth in mobile was offset by
strong performance in the rest of the Caribbean particularly in Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados.

In Panama, operating profit at £62 million in 2002 was £21 million or 25 per cent. lower than in 2001. This
decrease was primarily due to an exceptional impairment charge of £19 million in 2002 to write off TDMA and
network assets.

Macau’s operating profit at £38 million in 2002 was £5 million or 15 per cent. higher than in 2001 mainly
due to good revenue growth, headcount savings and reduced depreciation.

Rest of World delivered operating profit of £111 million in 2002, £17 million or 18 per cent. higher than in
2001. Strong performances in Yemen, the Seychelles, Maldives and Bahrain more than offset the impact of
disposals.

Year ended 31st March, 2003 compared with year ended 31st March, 2002

Turnover at £1,411 million in 2003 was £55 million or 4 per cent. lower than in 2002. At constant exchange
rates, turnover in 2003 was 5 per cent. higher than in 2002 partly due to the inclusion of 10 months’ results for
Cable & Wireless Guernsey. At constant exchange rates, mobile revenues were 26 per cent. higher in 2003 than
2002 reflecting increased customer bases across all geographies. IP and data services increased, particularly in
Macau where the launch of Asia Cities was combined with strong demand for broadband services and other value
added IP products.

International voice revenues were 5 per cent. lower at constant exchange rates largely due to declining tariffs
and settlement rates. Part of the reduction in tariffs reflected ‘tariff rebalancing’, the removal of cross subsidies
between international services and domestic services. There was a 5 per cent. increase in domestic voice revenues


-----

which reflected the impact of rebalancing and market growth, particularly in fixed to mobile traffic. The number
of fixed lines increased by 3 per cent.

Year ended 31st March, 2002 compared with year ended 31st March, 2001

Turnover at £1,466 million in 2002 was £33 million or 2 per cent. higher than in 2001. Excluding Mitratel
Indonesia, which was disposed of in May 2001, Cable & Wireless Regional revenue increased by 8 per cent. in
the year ended 31st March, 2002 to £1,459 million from £1,357 million in the prior year. At constant exchange
rates, turnover, excluding Mitratel, was 6 per cent. higher in 2003 than 2002. This growth reflects the continuing
success of the business in rebalancing away from international and towards domestic revenue, growth in the
mobile and IP and data markets, and the development of new businesses.

Year ended 31st March, 2003 compared with year ended 31st March, 2002

Operating costs before depreciation, amortisation and exceptional items were £821 million in 2003,
£16 million or 2 per cent. lower than in 2002. At constant exchange rates, operating costs were 8 per cent. higher
in 2003 than 2002 primarily due to increased outpayments and network costs. The growth in outpayments and
network costs was mainly attributable to the revenue growth against a background of liberalisation leading to
increased traffic volumes, customer numbers and terminations on third party networks. In addition, customer
acquisition costs, including mobile handset subsidies also rose.

Year ended 31st March, 2002 compared with year ended 31st March, 2001

Operating costs before depreciation and amortisation at £837 million in 2002 were broadly in line with 2001.
Excluding Mitratel Indonesia, there was a 4 per cent. increase at constant exchange rates primarily due to
increased customer acquisition and network costs reflecting growth in the mobile, IP and data businesses. At
constant exchange rates, staff costs in 2002 were 2 per cent. lower than in 2001 as the restructuring programme to
reduce headcount by 2,500 was largely completed.

before minority interests.

The remaining Cable & Wireless shareholding in Mobile One is now classified as a trade investment.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Treasury policy

The Group’s treasury operations are managed on the basis of objectives, policies and authorities approved by
Cable and Wireless plc’s Board of Directors.

The key responsibilities of the treasury function include funding, investment of surplus cash and the
management of interest rate and foreign currency risk.

To the extent that subsidiary operating companies undertake treasury transactions, these are governed by
policies adopted by the local Board of Directors, which are substantially consistent with Group policy.

Cable & Wireless uses derivatives and financial instruments including forward foreign exchange contracts,
interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and options in the management of financial exposures. Derivatives are
not used for trading or speculative purposes. All derivative transactions and positions are monitored and reported
to the Board.

Investment of Surplus Cash

At 31st March, 2003, Cable & Wireless had gross cash (including treasury instruments held as current asset
investments) of £3,165 million (2002: £4,888 million and 2001: £5,809 million).

This surplus cash is a significant component of the Group’s overall liquidity and capital resources.
Approximately 90 per cent. of the Group’s cash is held centrally and is predominantly invested in short-term bank
deposits up to 1 year and AAA-rated money market funds.

In certain circumstances, it has been efficient to use surplus funds to repurchase bonds. A total of US$800
million of the US$1,504 million zero coupon exchangeable bonds was bought back at an average of 97 per cent.
of face value. In addition, a total of US$19 million of the US$400 million bond has also been bought back.

The Group also purchased £75 million of Credit Linked Notes issued by an AA-rated bank and referenced to
the Company’s £200 million bond which matures in 2012. This transaction has a similar economic effect to
repurchasing the bonds for the period of the investment. Further information on these transactions is given in
Note 26 to the Financial Statements.

Approximately 10 per cent. of the Group’s cash is held in foreign subsidiaries some of whom operate in
jurisdictions which may, and do, restrict the ability to repatriate cash to the parent company. In addition, some of
the Group’s cash is required as cash collateral.

Funding

At 31st March, 2003, Cable & Wireless had gross debt of £1,546 million (2002: £2,259 million and 2001:
£2,931 million).

The Group’s debt comprises both bank debt and publicly quoted bonds of which £825 million matures
during the financial year to 31st March, 2004. Cable & Wireless’ debt has an average maturity of 4.7 years.
Excluding the £825 million maturing in the next year, the average maturity increases to 9.0 years.

Approximately 70 per cent. of the Group’s debt is represented by public bonds denominated in Sterling and
US Dollars. Two Sterling denominated bonds of £200 million each mature in 2012 and 2019 respectively. With
respect to the US dollar denominated bonds, a US$1,504 million bond matured in June 2003 and a US$400
million bond will mature in December 2003. During the year ended 31st March, 2003, Cable & Wireless
purchased US$600 million of the principal amount of the US$1,504 million bond (31st March, 2002: US$200
million).

The remainder of the Group debt represents primarily amortising loans with the exception of a loan of £121
million maturing in 2006.


-----

The US$1,504 million bond represented zero coupon exchangeable bonds, which were exchangeable into
ordinary shares of PCCW. The bonds were issued on 9th April, 2001 at 100 per cent. of their US$1,504 million
principal amount. The bonds were redeemed at their principal amount on 9th June, 2003.

On 16th June, 2003, the Company announced that it was offering £258 million Senior Unsecured
Convertible Bonds due 2010, with a cash coupon of 4 per cent. per annum, and an initial conversion price of
145 pence per share; the bonds will be redeemed at par. It is anticipated that this offering will complete prior to
25th July, 2003, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The funding will be used to strengthen the
Company’s balance sheet and increase its financial flexibility.

Borrowing facilities

The total amount of the Group’s undrawn committed facilities as at 31st March, 2003 was £30 million. This
facility matured on 30th June, 2003.

Credit ratings

The Company’s long-term credit rating was downgraded during the year to below investment grade. Credit
ratings at 3rd June, 2003 are detailed in the table below. The rating from Moody’s is under review at the date of
filing for a possible downgrade.

The ratings downgrade has no impact on the interest cost of existing debt. However the downgrade may
limit future access to the debt capital markets and may both increase the future cost of funding and impact
adversely the terms on which debt may be available. In addition, cash collateral or guarantees may be required to
support any future credit terms.

Escrow account

On 6th December, 2002, following a decision by Moody’s to downgrade the long term rating of the
Company from Baa2 to Ba1, the Group disclosed that a ‘ratings trigger’ clause became operative. The clause was
contained in the tax indemnity which formed part of the agreement with Deutsche Telekom for the disposal of the
Group’s 50 per cent. interest in One2One. This disposal was completed on 1st October, 1999 for a total cash
consideration of £3.45 billion. Cable & Wireless provided Deutsche Telekom with an indemnity in the event of
the Inland Revenue assessing tax liabilities against the companies sold by Cable & Wireless to Deutsche
Telekom. As a result of the downgrade, the Company paid £1.5 billion into escrow on 13th January, 2003.
Following the agreement reached with the Inland Revenue to settle the Group’s outstanding UK Corporation Tax
affairs for the ten years to 31st March, 2001, the monies held in escrow were released by 31st March, 2003 and
the funds received on 1st April, 2003.

Other loans and contractual obligations under leases

Cable & Wireless’ loans and contractual obligations under finance and operating leases are analysed in the
Notes 22 and 28 to the Financial Statements.

None of the above funding arrangements and facilities have covenants that are expected to restrict normal
business activities.


-----

Operating lease commitments

In the normal course of its business, Cable & Wireless and its subsidiaries enter into operating leases,
relating to property, customer terminating equipment and other operational commitments. Minimum lease terms
range from 1 year to 50 years. The effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in
future periods is summarised below.

Payments due by period Total Less than 1 year 1-2 years 2-3 years 3-4 years 4-5 years After 5 years

Operating lease payments
(undiscounted) . . . . . . . . . 1,612 245 182 160 140 132 753

In addition, under certain property operating leases Cable & Wireless and its subsidiaries could be required
to make payments to lessors at the end of the lease to restore the condition of the properties. These amounts will
not be known until the leases expire. The actual amounts paid may be reduced in the event that Cable & Wireless
is able to exit the contracts prior to the minimum lease term expiring.

In November 2002, Cable & Wireless disclosed estimated gross property and other lease costs in the region
of £2.2 billion as at 30th September, 2002. Since announcing this amount, the Group has continued to review its
property portfolio. The outcome of that review, together with the impact of lease exits achieved and payments
made by 31st March, 2003 reduce this figure to £1.6 billion. This is analysed in the table below.

-----

There was a net decrease in cash of £2,120 million in 2003, largely due to a £1,040 million increase in liquid
resources and capital expenditure of £810 million.

Operating activities generated net cash of £95 million in 2003 despite operating losses of £6,000 million as
these included significant non-cash item charges for depreciation and amortisation, £861 million, and exceptional
asset impairment charges, £5,106 million.

Tax paid in 2003 includes £380 million with respect to settlement of the Group’s UK tax affairs for the ten
years ended 31st March, 2001. Details of the settlement are given in Note 12 to the Financial Statements.

Capital expenditure of £810 million in 2003 included network build of £310 million and the rollout of a
GSM mobile network in the Caribbean and Panama and expansion of the TDMA network in the Caribbean
£113 million, together with expenditure on billing systems, IT support for capital projects and network
terminating and customer premises equipment.

Financial investments generated net cash of £595 million in 2003 of which £600 million related to the
proceeds on disposal of a portfolio of preference shares.

Liquid resources increased by £1,040 million in 2003. At 31st March, 2003 liquid resources included the
£1.5 billion placed into escrow that was released by 31st March, 2003 and the funds received on 1st April, 2003.

Net financing repaid of £578 million in 2003 included long term debt repayments of £649 million partly
offset by long term debt issued of £88 million.

DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Credit risk

Cash deposits and other financial instruments give rise to credit risk, which represents the loss that would be
recognised if a counterparty failed to perform as contracted. The counterparties to the Group’s financial
instruments are major international institutions and the credit rating of these counterparties is monitored on a
regular basis in accordance with guidelines established by the Board.

Interest rate risk

The Group is exposed to movements of interest rates on its debt, surplus cash balances and derivative
instruments. The treasury function seeks to reduce volatility by fixing a proportion of interest rates in advance.

Taking account of such actions, a 50 basis point increase in interest rates to which the Group is exposed
would increase net interest income by £9 million. A 50 basis point reduction in interest rates would reduce net
interest income by the same amount.

Exchange rate risk

The Group is exposed to movements in exchange rates in relation to foreign currency payments, dividend
income from foreign subsidiaries, reported profits of foreign subsidiaries and the net asset carrying value of
foreign investments.

Cable & Wireless trades in over 80 countries and much of its revenue is from international traffic flows
settled in major currencies, principally US dollars. In addition, many of the currencies of the countries in which
Cable & Wireless operates are linked, directly or indirectly, to the US dollar.

The Group manages its exposure to movements in exchange rates on a net basis and uses forward foreign
exchange contracts and other derivative and financial instruments to reduce the exposure.

As part of the overall policy of managing the exposure arising from foreign exchange movements relating to
the carrying value of foreign investments, the Group may, from time to time, elect to match certain foreign
currency liabilities against foreign investments.

During the year the Group reversed a previous decision to match foreign currency liabilities totalling £486
million. These liabilities were re-denominated into Sterling. There was no cost to the Group from this transaction.
Currently there are no foreign currency liabilities matched against foreign investments.

No foreign currency exposure arose from the US$1,504 million PCCW zero coupon exchangeable bond
since this was matched by US dollar cash investments.


-----

In broad terms, based on the 2003 mix of profits, the impact of a unilateral 1 per cent. weakening of sterling
would have been to increase the operating loss by £32 million.

Overseas subsidiaries generally finance themselves in their domestic currency. However, in Jamaica it is
impractical to implement this policy due to limited availability of local currency funding. Consequently Cable &
Wireless Jamaica is predominantly funded with US dollar denominated bank debt.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

In the preparation of Cable & Wireless’ consolidated financial statements a number of estimates and
assumptions are made relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition. Results may differ
significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. Cable & Wireless believes that the
following discussion addresses its most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the
presentation of its consolidated financial condition and results. These policies require management’s most
difficult, subjective and complex judgements, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of
matters that are inherently uncertain.

Valuation of fixed assets and goodwill

Cable & Wireless assesses the impairment of fixed assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that are considered important
which could trigger an impairment review include the following:

s significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;

s significant changes in the use of its assets or the strategy for its overall business;

s significant negative industry or economic trends; and

s significant decline in its stock price for a sustained period and its market capitalisation relative to net book
value.

Cable & Wireless determines any impairment by comparing the carrying values of each of Cable &
Wireless’ income generating units to their recoverable amounts (the higher of net realisable value and the present
value of the future cash flows obtainable as a result of an asset’s continued use). During 2003, Cable & Wireless
impaired tangible fixed assets by £2,381 million (2002: £1,909 million) and goodwill by £2,725 million
(2002: £2,007 million). The impairment represented the amount by which the carrying value exceeded the present
value of the future cash flows.

Future cash flows were determined with reference to Cable & Wireless’ five year plan using a growth rate of
2.5 per cent. in the period beyond Cable & Wireless’ five year plan (based on a nominal increase in GDP for the
countries in which Cable & Wireless operates), and a discount rate of 14 per cent. which represents the estimated
weighted average cost of capital for Cable & Wireless. Changes to the assumptions used by management to
determine the level of impairment required, such as the discount rate or growth rate used, could significantly
affect Cable & Wireless’ results.

Depreciation and amortisation of fixed assets

Cable & Wireless assigns useful lives to fixed assets based on periodic studies of actual asset lives and the
intended use for those assets. Changes in circumstances such as technological advances, prospective economic
utilisation and physical condition of the assets concerned could result in the actual useful lives differing from
initial estimates. Where Cable & Wireless determines that the useful life of property and equipment should be
shortened, Cable & Wireless depreciates the net book value in excess of the residual value over the revised
remaining useful life, thereby increasing depreciation expense. Any change in asset lives would be reported in
Cable & Wireless’ financial statements when the change in estimate is determined. There have been no material
changes in asset lives during the periods presented.

Revenue recognition

Turnover, which excludes value added tax, represents the amount receivable in respect of
telecommunications services provided to customers and is accounted for on the accruals basis. Revenue is
recognised monthly as services are provided. Revenue in respect of services invoiced in advance is deferred and
recognised on provision of the service. Revenue in respect of unbilled services is accrued.


-----

Interconnection with other operators

In Cable & Wireless’ normal course of business it interconnects its networks with other telecommunications
operators. In certain instances it uses estimates to determine the amount of income receivable from or payments
to these other operators. The prices at which these services are charged are sometimes regulated and may be
subject to retrospective adjustment. Estimates are used in assessing the likely effect of these adjustments.

Exceptional items

Under UK GAAP, the Company classified the following income/(costs) as exceptional items:

2003 2002 2001

£m £m £m
Exceptional operating costs . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (442) (210) —

Exceptional profits on disposal of fixed assets. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 62 — 42

Judgement is required to classify such items as exceptional items. The Company is guided by FRS 3
‘Reporting Financial Performance’ which provides that material items which derive from events or transactions
that fall within the ordinary activities are disclosed as exceptional items by virtue of their size or incidence such
that the financial statements give a true and fair view. Exceptional depreciation and amortisation arise from the
impairment review discussed above.

Exceptional operating costs

In the year ended 31st March, 2003 exceptional items included in other operating costs related principally to
provisions for ongoing obligations associated with US businesses from which Cable & Wireless withdrew,
impaired assets and redundancy and reorganisation costs incurred during the year. These provisions are based on
various assumptions, including future severance costs, sublease or disposal costs and contractual termination
costs. Such estimates are judgmental and may change based on actual experience.

Provisions

The Company complies with FRS 12 ‘Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets’. A provision is
recognised when there is a constructive obligation in respect of a past event. Provisions were recognised for tax,
pensions, redundancy costs, property costs and onerous contracts during 31st March, 2003. Management’s
judgement is required to quantify such provisions.

Pensions

The regular cost of providing benefits under defined benefit schemes is charged to operating profit over the
expected remaining service lives of the members of the schemes so as to achieve a constant percentage of
pensionable pay. Variations from the regular cost arising from periodic actuarial valuations of the principal
defined benefit schemes are allocated to operating profit over the expected remaining service lives of the
members.

The expected cost of providing these defined benefit pensions will depend on an assessment of such
factors as:

s the life expectancy of the members;

s the length of service;

s the rate of salary progression;

s the rate of return earned on assets in the future; and

s the rate used to discount future pension liabilities.

The assumptions used by Cable & Wireless are set out in Note 8 to the Financial Statements and are
estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which may not necessarily be borne out in


-----

practice. Changes to these assumptions could materially impact the size of the unfunded defined benefit scheme
liability of £578 million, calculated under FRS 17, Retirement Benefits, disclosed in Note 8.

Restructuring charges

In the year ended 31st March, 2001, restructuring charges were recorded as a result of additional actions to
reorganise, re-size and reduce operating costs and create greater efficiency in various areas. These charges, for
both severance and exit costs, required the use of estimates. Actual restructuring results did not differ materially
from those estimated.

NEW UK ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ADOPTED

Capacity Sales

As disclosed in prior years, the Group sells network capacity to third parties pursuant to indefeasible rightsof-use agreements (IRUs). In prior periods, in accordance with UK accounting standards, where substantially all
of the risks and rewards of ownership were transferred to the purchaser over the economic life of the asset, these
transactions were accounted for as sales and recognised in turnover at fair value at the time of delivery and
acceptance.

On 27th March, 2003, the Urgent Issues Task Force of the UK Accounting Standards Board issued UITF 36,
Contracts for sales of capacity. The abstract is applicable for accounting periods ending on or after 30th June,
2003, although early adoption is encouraged, and application is retrospective. The Group has adopted UITF 36
for the year ended 31st March, 2003.

As a result of the adoption of the new abstract, revenues or gains in respect of capacity sales to carriers from
whom capacity or other services were also acquired are no longer recognised as the transactions are not
considered to meet all the conditions required under the new abstract, in particular the requirement for the
capacity provided or received to have a readily ascertainable market value as set out in FRS 10, Goodwill and
intangible assets. The Group’s cash sales to carriers with no related purchase are largely unaffected by the
conditions of the new abstract and will continue to be recognised at the time of delivery and acceptance.

The Group’s new accounting policy in respect of capacity sales is set out in the Group’s statement of
accounting policies on page F-8 below. The impact of adoption on the reported results of the Group is set out in
Note 4 to the Financial Statements, including the impact on prior periods as the abstract applies retrospectively.

UNITED KINGDOM TAXATION

The comments below are of a general nature. They reflect the Issuer’s understanding of current
United Kingdom taxation law and United Kingdom Inland Revenue practice and they are subject to changes
therein. They do not purport to constitute legal or tax advice. In addition, the comments relate only to the position
of persons who are the absolute beneficial owners of the Bonds and the Coupons and may not apply to certain
classes of person (such as dealers in securities and persons connected with the Issuer) to whom special rules may
apply. These comments are not exhaustive.

Holders of Bonds who are in any doubt as to their tax position or who may be subject to tax in any other
jurisdiction should consult their professional advisers.

1. Interest on the Bonds

1.1 The Bonds issued will constitute ‘‘quoted Eurobonds’’ provided they are and continue to be listed on a
recognised stock exchange, within the meaning of Section 841 of the Income and Corporation Taxes
Act 1988 (the Act). The London Stock Exchange is a recognised stock exchange for these purposes.
Under an Inland Revenue published practice, securities will be treated as listed on the London Stock
Exchange if they are admitted to the Official List by the United Kingdom Listing Authority and admitted to
trading by the London Stock Exchange. Whilst the Bonds are and continue to be quoted Eurobonds,
payments of interest on the Bonds may be made without withholding or deduction for or on account of
United Kingdom tax.

1.2 Interest on the Bonds may also be paid without withholding or deduction on account of United Kingdom
tax where interest on the Bonds is paid to a person who belongs in the United Kingdom and, at the time the
payment is made, the Issuer reasonably believes (and any person by or through whom interest on the Bonds
is paid reasonably believes) that either:

(a) the beneficial owner is within the charge to United Kingdom corporation tax as regards the payment of
interest; or

(b) the payment is made to:

(i) a local authority;

(ii) a charity (within the meaning of section 506(1) of the Act);

(iii) the trustees or other persons having the management of a fund entitled to an exemption under
section 620(6) of the Act (retirement annuity trust schemes);

(iv) a person holding investments or deposits for the purposes of a scheme entitled to exemption under
section 643(2) of the Act (approved personal pension schemes);

(v) the plan manager of a plan, where an individual investing under the plan is entitled to an
exemption under section 333 of the Act (personal equity plans and individual saving accounts),
and the plan manager receives the payment in respect of investments under the plan;

(vi) a society or institution with whom tax-exempt special savings accounts (within the meaning of
section 326A of the Act) may be held, where the society or institution receives the payment in
respect of investments held for the purposes of such accounts,

or is made to one of the other classes of exempt bodies or persons set out in section 349B of the Act,

provided that the Inland Revenue has not given a direction (in circumstances where it has reasonable
grounds to believe that it is likely that none of the conditions specified in section 349B of the Act will be
satisfied in respect of such payment of interest at the time the payment is made) that the interest should be
paid under deduction of tax.

1.3 In all other cases, interest will generally be paid under deduction of income tax at the lower rate
(currently 20 per cent.) subject to any direction to the contrary from the Inland Revenue in respect of such
relief as may be available pursuant to the provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty.

1.4 Persons in the United Kingdom (1) paying interest to or receiving interest on behalf of another person, or
(2) paying amounts due on the redemption of the Bonds to or receiving such amounts on behalf of another
person, may be required to provide certain information to the United Kingdom Inland Revenue regarding the


-----

identity of the payee or person entitled to the interest and, in certain circumstances, such information may be
exchanged with tax authorities in other countries.

1.5 The interest has a United Kingdom source and accordingly may be chargeable to United Kingdom tax by
direct assessment. Where the interest is paid without withholding or deduction, the interest will not be
assessed to United Kingdom tax in the hands of holders of the Bonds (other than certain trustees) who are
not resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom, except where such persons carry on a trade, profession
or vocation in the United Kingdom through a United Kingdom branch or agency in connection with which
the interest is received or to which the Bonds are attributable, in which case tax may be levied on the
United Kingdom branch or agency. There are exemptions for interest received by certain categories of
agents (such as some brokers and investment managers). Proposed legislation, intended to take effect in
relation to accounting periods beginning on or after 1st January, 2003, would (if enacted in its current form)
amend the above to the effect that corporate holders of Bonds not resident in the United Kingdom may be
liable to United Kingdom taxation only to the extent that they carry on a trade through a United Kingdom
permanent establishment to which the Bonds are attributable. Exemption from, or reduction of, such United
Kingdom tax liability might be available under an applicable double taxation treaty.

1.6 If interest were paid under deduction of United Kingdom income tax (e.g. if the Bonds ceased to be listed on
a recognised stock exchange), Bondholders who are not resident in the United Kingdom may be able
to recover all or part of the tax deducted if there is an appropriate provision in an applicable double
taxation treaty.

1.7 Bondholders within the charge to United Kingdom corporation tax will be subject to tax as income on
interest arising in respect of the Bonds (whether attributable to currency fluctuations or otherwise) broadly in
accordance with their statutory accounting treatment. Such Bondholders will generally be charged in
each accounting period by reference to interest which, in accordance with such Bondholder’s authorised
accounting method, is applicable to that period.

1.8 Bondholders who are not subject to United Kingdom corporation tax but who are subject to United Kingdom
income tax will generally be subject to income tax on interest arising in respect of the Bonds on a
receipts basis.

1.9 On 3rd June, 2003, the European Council of Economics and Finance Ministers agreed on proposals under
which Member States will be required to provide to the tax authorities of another Member State details of
payments of interest (or similar income) paid by a person within its jurisdiction to an individual resident in
that other Member State, except that, for a transitional period, Belgium, Luxembourg and Austria will
instead be required to operate a withholding system in relation to such payments (the ending of such
transitional period being dependent upon the conclusion of certain other agreements relating to information
exchange with certain other countries). The proposals are anticipated to take effect from 1st January, 2005.

2. Dividends on the Ordinary Shares

2.1 The Issuer will not be required to withhold tax at source when paying a dividend on the Ordinary Shares.

2.2 An individual holder of Ordinary Shares who is resident in the United Kingdom (for tax purposes) and who
receives a dividend from the Issuer should generally be entitled to a tax credit which such shareholder
may set off against his total income tax liability on the dividend. The tax credit will be equal to 10 per cent.
of the aggregate of the dividend and the tax credit (the gross dividend), which is also equal to one-ninth of
the cash dividend received. A United Kingdom resident individual shareholder who is liable to income tax
at the starting or basic rate will be subject to tax on the dividend at the rate of 10 per cent. of the gross
dividend, so that the tax credit will satisfy in full such shareholder’s liability to income tax on the dividend
and there is no right to claim any repayment from the Inland Revenue. A United Kingdom resident
individual shareholder who is not liable to income tax in respect of the gross dividend will not be entitled to
repayment of the tax credit. In the case of a United Kingdom resident individual shareholder who is liable
to income tax at the higher rate, the tax credit will be set against but not fully match his tax liability on the
gross dividend and he will have to account for additional tax equal (at present rates) to 22.5 per cent. of
the gross dividend (which is also equal to 25 per cent. of the cash dividend received).

2.3 United Kingdom resident taxpayers who are not liable to United Kingdom tax on dividends, including
pension funds and charities, will not be entitled to claim repayment of the tax credit attaching to dividends
paid by the Issuer, although charities will be entitled to limited compensation in lieu of repayable tax credits
until 5th April, 2004.


-----

2.4 Tax credits on dividends paid by the Issuer in respect of Ordinary Shares held in personal equity
plans (PEPs) or individual savings account (ISAs) will be repayable on dividends paid on or before
5th April, 2004.

2.5 A corporate shareholder resident in the United Kingdom for tax purposes will generally not be subject to
United Kingdom corporation tax on dividends paid by the Issuer. Such shareholders will not be able to claim
repayment of tax credits attaching to dividends.

2.6 A non-United Kingdom tax resident shareholder is not generally entitled to the benefit of a tax credit in
respect of any dividend received.

2.7 A shareholder resident outside the United Kingdom may also be subject to foreign taxation on dividend
income under local law. A shareholder who is not resident in the United Kingdom (for tax purposes) should
consult his own tax adviser concerning his tax liabilities on dividends received from the Issuer.

3. Disposal or Conversion of the Bonds

3.1 Non-United Kingdom Resident Bondholders

Bondholders who are not resident or ordinarily resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom and who
do not carry on a trade, profession or vocation in the United Kingdom through a branch or agency to which
the Bonds are attributable are outside the charge to United Kingdom taxation on chargeable gains with
respect to the disposal of the Bonds and the conversion of the Bonds into Ordinary Shares. See paragraph 1.5
above in relation to the position in respect of accounting periods beginning on or after 1st January, 2003 of
non-resident companies carrying on a trade through a United Kingdom permanent establishment to which
the Bonds are attributable.

3.2 Bondholders Within the Charge to United Kingdom Corporation Tax

The Bonds will constitute ‘‘relevant discounted securities’’ as defined in Schedule 13 to the Finance Act
1996 and accordingly Bondholders within the charge to United Kingdom corporation tax will be party to a
‘‘loan relationship’’ within the meaning of Chapter II of Part IV of the Finance Act 1996. Consequently, such
a Bondholder:

(a) will be subject to tax on all profits on the Bonds (whether income or capital in nature or whether
attributable to currency fluctuations or otherwise) as income (broadly in accordance with its statutory
accounting treatment);

(b) will be treated on conversion, for the purposes of computing its profits that are subject to
United Kingdom corporation tax as income, as disposing of the relevant Bonds for their market value
at the time of conversion; and

(c) will be treated on conversion, for the purposes of United Kingdom corporation tax on chargeable gains,
as acquiring the Ordinary Shares for an amount equal to the market value of the relevant Bonds at the
time of conversion less the amount of any cash received on conversion.

3.3 Other Bondholders

As detailed above, the Bonds are relevant discounted securities. Consequently, a Bondholder who is not
within the charge to United Kingdom corporation tax and is resident or ordinarily resident for tax purposes
in the United Kingdom or carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the United Kingdom through a branch
or agency to which his Bonds are attributable:

(a) will be subject to United Kingdom income tax on any profit which it makes on a transfer or redemption
of the Bonds;

(b) should be treated on conversion, for the purposes of applying the rules described in paragraph (a)
above, as redeeming the relevant Bonds for a payment of a sum equal to the market value of the
Ordinary Shares into which the Bond is converted and any cash received on redemption; and

(c) will be treated on conversion, for the purposes of United Kingdom capital gains tax, as acquiring
his Ordinary Shares for an amount equal to the market value of the relevant Bonds at the time of
conversion less the amount of any cash received on conversion.


-----

4. Disposal of Ordinary Shares

A disposal of Ordinary Shares will constitute a disposal for the purposes of United Kingdom taxation of
capital gains and, accordingly, may give rise to a liability to taxation for Shareholders who are resident for tax
purposes or ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom or carried on a trade, profession or vocation in the United
Kingdom through a branch or agency to which the Ordinary Shares are attributable, subject to the usual reliefs
and allowances which may then be available. See paragraph 1.5 above in relation to the position in respect of
accounting periods beginning on or after 1st January, 2003 of non-resident companies carrying on a trade through
a United Kingdom permanent establishment to which the Bonds are attributable.

5. Stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax

5.1 No United Kingdom stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax (SDRT) is payable on the issue of a Bond or on
the transfer by delivery of a Bond (so long as the Bonds and Ordinary Shares continue to be listed on a
recognised stock exchange and the agreement to transfer is not made in contemplation of or as part of an
arrangement for a take-over of the Issuer).

5.2 No United Kingdom stamp duty or SDRT is payable on the issue of the Ordinary Shares upon conversion of
Bonds other than an issue to issuers of depositary receipts or providers of clearance services (or their
nominees or agents).

5.3 The transfer on sale of an Ordinary Share will be liable to ad valorem stamp duty generally at the rate of
0.5 per cent. of the amount or value of the consideration for the transfer rounded up to the nearest £5. The
purchaser normally pays the stamp duty.

5.4 An unconditional agreement to sell an Ordinary Share will generally give rise to a liability on the purchaser
to SDRT, at the rate of 0.5 per cent. of the amount or value of the consideration for the sale. If a duly
stamped transfer in respect of the agreement is produced within six years of the date that the agreement is
entered into or (if later) the date that it becomes unconditional, any SDRT paid is repayable generally with
interest, and any unpaid SDRT charge is cancelled.

5.5 Transfers of Ordinary Shares (1) to, or to a nominee or agent for, a person whose business is or includes
issuing depositary receipts within Section 67 or Section 93 of the Finance Act 1986 or (2) to, or to a nominee
agent for, a person providing a clearance service within Section 70 or Section 96 of the Finance Act 1986,
will generally be subject to stamp duty or SDRT at 1.5 per cent. of the amount or value of the consideration
or, in certain circumstances, the value of the Ordinary Shares transferred (rounded up to the nearest £5 in the
case of stamp duty) unless, in the case of a transfer to a clearance service, the clearance service has made an
election under Section 97A of the Finance Act 1986. Clearance services may, provided they meet certain
conditions, elect for the 0.5 per cent. rate of stamp duty or SDRT to apply to transfers of securities within
such services instead of the 1.5 per cent. rate applying to an issue or transfer of such securities into the
clearance service.

5.6 Under the CREST system for paperless share transfers, no stamp duty or SDRT will arise on a transfer of
Ordinary Shares into the system unless such transfer is made for a consideration in money or money’s worth,
in which case a liability to SDRT (usually at the rate of 0.5 per cent.) will arise. Paperless transfers of
Ordinary Shares within CREST will be liable to SDRT rather than stamp duty.

THE ABOVE SUMMARIES REFLECT CERTAIN ASPECTS OF CURRENT LAW AND
PRACTICE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. PROSPECTIVE BONDHOLDERS WHO ARE IN DOUBT
AS TO THEIR TAX POSITION OR WHO MAY BE SUBJECT TO TAX IN ANY OTHER
JURISDICTION SHOULD CONSULT THEIR PROFESSIONAL ADVISERS.

Limited, Deutsche Bank AG London, HSBC Bank plc, Lehman Brothers International (Europe) and Morgan
Stanley & Co. International Limited (the Managers) have, pursuant to a Subscription Agreement dated 10th July,

Managers against certain liabilities.

The Issuer has agreed that it will not, without the prior consent of J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd., for a period of
90 days commencing on 16th June, 2003 (i) issue, offer, lend, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or
contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, mortgage, charge, assign, grant any option, right, or
warrant to purchase, or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any Ordinary Shares or any

or in respect thereof) or any rights arising from or attaching to any such Ordinary Shares at any time, or (ii) enter
into any swap or other agreement that transfers, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of
ownership of Ordinary Shares, or enter into any other transaction with the same economic effect as, or agree to do
or announce or otherwise publicise the intention to do any of the foregoing, whether any such transaction is to be
settled by delivery of Ordinary Shares or such other securities, in cash or otherwise, provided that nothing herein
shall prevent or restrict (a) the issue of the Bonds, the conversion of the Bonds into Ordinary Shares or any
purchase of Bonds by the Issuer, (b) the completion of any transaction which was publicly announced prior to
16th June, 2003, (c) the exercise of any options or other rights granted prior to 16th June, 2003 to officers and
employees of the Group (being the Issuer and its subsidiaries and affiliates) and (d) the grant and/or exercise of
any options or other rights to or by officers and employees of the Group pursuant to any scheme or plan in
existence prior to 16th June, 2003.

United States

The Bonds and the Shares to be issued and delivered on conversion of the Bonds have not been and will not
be registered under the Securities Act and, subject to certain exceptions, may not be offered or sold within the
United States.

The Bonds may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S.
persons except in accordance with Regulation S or pursuant to an exemption from, or a transaction not subject to,
the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Each Manager has represented that it has offered and sold the
Bonds, and has agreed that it will offer and sell the Bonds, constituting part of its allotment (i) as part of their
distribution at any time and (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering and
the Closing Date, only in accordance with Rule 903 of Regulation S. Accordingly, neither it, its affiliates nor any
persons acting on its or their behalf have engaged or will engage in any directed selling efforts with respect to the
Bonds and it and they have complied and will comply with the offering restrictions requirement of Regulation S.
Each Manager has agreed that, at or prior to confirmation of sale of Bonds, it will have sent to each distributor,
dealer or person receiving a selling concession, fee or other remuneration that purchases Bonds from it during the
distribution compliance period a confirmation or notice to substantially the following effect:


-----

‘‘The securities covered hereby have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 (the
Securities Act) and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S.
persons (i) as part of their distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the
commencement of the offering and the Closing Date, except in either case in accordance with Regulation S under
the Securities Act. Terms used above have the meanings given to them by Regulation S under the Securities
Act.’’

The Bonds are subject to United States tax requirements and may not be offered, sold or delivered within the
United States or its possessions or to a United States person, except in certain transactions permitted by United
States tax regulations.

Until 40 days after the commencement of the offering of the Bonds, an offer or sale of the Bonds within the
United States by any dealer (whether or not participating in the offering of the Bonds) may violate the registration
requirements of the Securities Act.

United Kingdom

Each Manager has represented and agreed that:

(1) it has not offered or sold and will not offer or sell any Bonds to persons in the United Kingdom prior to
admission of the Bonds to listing in accordance with Part VI of the Act except to persons whose
ordinary activities involve them in acquiring, holding, managing or disposing of investments (as
principal or agent) for the purposes of their businesses or otherwise in circumstances which have not
resulted and will not result in an offer to the public in the United Kingdom within the meaning of the
Public Offers of Securities Regulations 1995 (as amended) or the Act;

(2) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the Act with respect to anything done
by it in relation to the Bonds in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom; and

(3) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of
Section 21 of the Act) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Bonds in circumstances
in which Section 21(1) of the Act does not apply to the Issuer.

General

No action has been taken by the Issuer or the Managers that would, or is intended to, permit a public offer of
the Bonds or distribution of this Offering Circular or any other offering material in relation to the Bonds in any
country or jurisdiction where any such action for that purpose is required. Accordingly, each Manager has
undertaken that it will not, directly or indirectly, offer or sell any Bonds or distribute or publish any offering
circular, prospectus, form of application, advertisement or other document or information in any country or
jurisdiction except under circumstances that will result in compliance with any applicable laws and regulations
and all offers and sales of Bonds by it will be made on the same terms.

Without prejudice to the generality of the above, each Manager has agreed that it will obtain any consent,
approval or permission which is required for the offer, purchase or sale by it of Bonds under the laws and
regulations in force in any jurisdiction to which it is subject or in which it makes such offers, purchases or sales
and it will comply with all such laws and regulations.

GENERAL INFORMATION

1. Listing

The listing of the Bonds on the Official List will be expressed in pounds sterling as a percentage of their
principal amount (excluding accrued interest). Transactions will normally be effected for settlement in
pounds sterling and, under current practice, for delivery on the third business day after the day of the
transaction. It is expected that admission to the Official List and admission of the Bonds to trading on the
London Stock Exchange’s Market for listed Securities will be granted on or about 16th July, 2003 subject
only to the issue of the Temporary Global Bond. Before official listing and admission to trading, however,
dealings in the Bonds will be permitted by the London Stock Exchange in accordance with its rules.

2. Authorisation

The issue of the Bonds was authorised by a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Issuer passed on
13th June, 2003 and by a committee of the Board of Directors passed on 15th June, 2003.

agreed to be issued or is now proposed to be issued fully or partly paid, either for cash or for a

apply to the authorised but unissued share capital of the Issuer except to the extent disapplied by the
resolution referred to in paragraph 5.5(b) below. Section 89(1) of the Companies Act would apply to the
allotment of the Bonds but not to the allotment of the Ordinary Shares which will be issued on conversion of
the Bonds. However, the allotment of the Bonds will take advantage of the disapplication of the provisions


-----

of section 89(1) of the Companies Act conferred by the resolution referred to in paragraph 5.5(b) below. In
addition, the Directors of the Issuer have tabled a resolution to be passed at the next annual general meeting,
due to be held on 25th July, 2003, to give them the power to allot further equity securities in connection with
a rights issue or otherwise up to a maximum aggregate nominal amount of £198,593,791.25 in relation to
paragraph 5.6 below.

5.5 By resolutions passed at the annual general meeting of the Issuer held on 12th July, 2002:

(a) the Directors of the Issuer were generally authorised, pursuant to section 80 of the Companies Act, to
allot relevant securities (as defined in that section) up to a maximum aggregate nominal value of
£279,468,827, such authority to expire on 11th July, 2007; and

(b) the Directors of the Issuer were given power to allot equity securities (as defined in section 94 of the
Companies Act) for cash provided that such power, which was expressed to expire on 11th July, 2007,
was limited to the allotment of equity securities in connection with a rights issue and otherwise up to a
maximum aggregate nominal amount of £29,776,558.

5.6 The resolution tabled for the next annual general meeting, due to be held on 25th July, 2003, referred to in
paragraph 5.4, together with the resolutions referred to in paragraph 5.5 relate to the number of ordinary
shares relating to the Bonds. The terms and conditions of the conversion rights of the Bonds are set out from

7. Summary of the memorandum and articles of association

7.1 Memorandum of association

The memorandum of association of the Issuer provides that its objects are, amongst other things, to conduct
communications business of all types including, but not limited to, telegraph, telephone, telex, television,
radar, satellite and computers throughout the world and doing all matters and things incidental thereto. The
objects of the Issuer are set out in full in clause 4 of its memorandum of association which is available for
inspection as described in paragraph 15 below.

7.2 Articles of association

The articles of the Issuer adopted on 12th July, 2002, include provisions to the following effect:

(a) Rights attaching to ordinary shares

(i) Voting rights of members – subject to disenfranchisement in the event of (aa) non-payment of any
call or other sum due and payable in respect of any share or (bb) any non-compliance with any
statutory notice requiring disclosure of the beneficial ownership of any shares and subject to any
special rights or restrictions as to voting for the time being attached to any shares (as to which
there are none at present). On a show of hands every member who (being an individual) is present


-----

in person or (being a corporation) is present by a representative not being himself a member, has
one vote and on a poll every member present in person, by proxy or by representative has one vote
for every share of which he is a holder. In the case of joint holders, the vote of the person whose
name stands first in the register of members and who tenders a vote is accepted to the exclusion of
any votes tendered by any other joint holders.

(ii) Dividends – subject to the rights attached to any shares issued on any special terms and conditions
(as to which there are none at present), dividends shall be declared and paid according to the
amounts paid up on the shares in respect of which the dividend is paid, but no amount paid up on a
share in advance of calls should be treated for these purposes as paid up on the share.

(iii) Dividends – the holders of Shares are entitled to the profits of the company available for dividend
and resolved by ordinary resolution to be distributed either by the Company in general meeting or
by the Directors from time to time. The Directors may, with the sanction of an ordinary resolution,
operate a plan (or plans) for the benefit of shareholders whereby the Directors, on such terms and
conditions as they think fit, may offer shareholders various options in lieu of receiving cash
dividends. These alternatives include the right to elect to receive fully paid ordinary shares or the
right to elect either to subscribe for unissued ordinary shares or to pay up any partly paid or unpaid
ordinary shares. The Companies Act limits the Company’s payment of dividends and returns of
capital to distributable profits and reserves.

(iv) Return of capital – subject to the rights attached to any shares issued on any special terms and
conditions (no shares of this type having yet been issued), on a winding up the surplus assets
remaining after payment of all creditors of the Issuer will be divided among the members of the
Issuer according to their respective holdings of shares. The liquidator may, with the sanction of an
extraordinary resolution of the Issuer and any other sanction required by statute (aa) divide among
the members in specie the whole or any part of the assets of the Issuer; or (bb) vest the whole or
any part of the assets in trustees on such trusts for the benefit of members as the liquidator shall
think fit, but no member shall be compelled to accept any assets upon which there is any liability.

(b) Transfer of shares

A member may transfer all or any of his uncertificated shares and the Issuer shall register the transfer of
any uncertificated shares in accordance with any applicable statutory provision. The board may, in its
absolute discretion and without giving any reason for its decision, refuse to register any transfer of an
uncertificated share where permitted by any applicable statutory provision. If the board refuses to
register a transfer of an uncertificated share it shall, within two months of the date on which the transfer
instruction relating to such a transfer was received by the Issuer, send to the transferee notice of the
refusal.

A member may transfer all or any of his certificated shares by an instrument of transfer in any usual
form, or in such other form as the board may approve. The instrument of transfer shall be signed by or
on behalf of the transferor and, except in the case of a fully paid share, by or on behalf of the transferee.
The board may, in its absolute discretion and without giving any reason for it, refuse to register any
transfer of any certificated share which is not fully paid up (but not so as to prevent dealings in listed
shares from taking place on an open and proper basis) or any certificated share on which the Issuer has a
lien. The board may also refuse to register any instrument of transfer of a certificated share unless it is
lodged at the registered office, or such other place as the board may decide, for registration,
accompanied by the share certificate for the shares to be transferred (except where the shares are
registered in the name of a market nominee and no certificate has been issued for them) and such other
evidence as the board may reasonably require to prove title of the intending transferor. If the board
refuses to register a transfer of a certificated share it shall, within two months after the date on which
the instrument of transfer was lodged, send to the transferee notice of the refusal. The board may refuse
to register any transfer unless it is only in respect of one class of shares and in favour of no more than
four transferees.

(c) Changes in capital

The Issuer may by ordinary resolution

(i) increase its share capital;

(ii) consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into shares of a larger amount;

(iii) sub-divide all or part of its share capital into shares of a smaller amount; and


-----

(iv) cancel any shares which have not, at the date of the ordinary resolution, been taken or agreed to be
taken by any person and diminish the amount of its authorised share capital by the amount of the
shares so cancelled.

The Issuer may by special resolution:

(v) purchase its own shares; and

(vi) reduce its share capital and any capital redemption reserve or share premium account.

(d) Variation of rights

Whenever the share capital of the Issuer is divided into different classes of shares (which it is not as at
the date of this document), all or any of the rights for the time being attached to any class of shares may
be varied, either with the consent in writing of the holders of three-fourths in nominal value of the
issued shares of that class or with the sanction of an extraordinary resolution passed at a separate
general meeting of the holders of those shares. At any separate general meeting, the necessary quorum
is two persons holding or representing by proxy at least one-third in nominal amount of the issued
shares of the class in question (but at any adjourned meeting, any person holding shares of the class or
his proxy is a quorum).

(e) Uncertificated shares – general powers

In relation to any uncertificated share, the Issuer may utilise the relevant system in which it is held to
the fullest extent available from time to time in the exercise of any of its powers or functions under any
applicable statutory provision or the articles of association or otherwise in effecting any action. Any
provision in the articles of association in relation to uncertificated shares which is inconsistent with any
applicable statutory provision shall not apply. The Issuer may, by notice in writing to the holder of an
uncertificated share, require the holder to change the form of that share to certificated form within such
period as may be specified in the notice. For the purpose of effecting any action by the Issuer, the
Directors may determine that holdings of the same member in uncertificated form and in certificated
form shall be treated as separate holdings.

(f) Directors

(i) The Directors (disregarding alternate Directors) shall not, unless otherwise determined by an
ordinary resolution of the Issuer, be less than five nor more than 20 in number.

(ii) A director need not be a member of the Issuer.

(iii) There is no age limit for Directors.

(iv) At each annual general meeting any director then in office who has been appointed by the board
since the previous annual general meeting or who was in office at the time of the two previous
annual general meetings and who was not elected or re-elected by general meeting of the Issuer
shall retire from office but shall be eligible for re-appointment.

(v) The Directors shall be paid out of the funds of the Issuer by way of remuneration for their services
as Directors. Such fees shall not exceed in aggregate £350,000 per annum or such larger sum as
the Issuer may, by ordinary resolution, determine. Such fee shall be divided among them in such
proportion and manner as they may agree, or failing agreement, equally.

(vi) The board may grant special remuneration to any director who performs any special or extra
services to or at the request of the Issuer. Special remuneration may be payable to a director in
addition to his ordinary remuneration (if any) as a director.

(vii) The Directors shall also be paid out of the funds of the Issuer all expenses properly incurred by
them in and about the discharge of their duties, including their expenses of travelling to and from
the meetings of the board, committee meetings, general meetings and separate meetings of the
holders of any class of securities of the Issuer.

(viii) The board can decide whether to provide pensions, annual payments, insurance, gratuities or other
benefits to any people who are, or were, Directors or employees of the Issuer or of any subsidiary
undertaking or acquired company or business. The Directors or any committee authorised by the
Directors may extend these arrangements to any relation or dependant of such person. This
includes present or former spouses. The Directors can also decide to contribute to a scheme or
fund or to pay premiums to a third party for these purposes.


-----

(ix) A Director or former Director will not be accountable to the Issuer or the shareholders for any
benefit provided as described in sub-paragraph (viii) above. Anyone receiving such a benefit will
not be disqualified from being or becoming a Director of the Issuer.

(x) Subject to any applicable statutory provisions, a director shall not be disqualified by his office
from entering into any contract with the Issuer, either with regard to his tenure of any office or
position in the management, administration or conduct of the business of the Issuer, or as vendor,
purchaser or otherwise. A director may hold and be remunerated in respect of any other office or
place of profit (other than the office of auditor of the Issuer) in conjunction with his office as
director and he (or his firm) may also act in a professional capacity for the Issuer (except as
auditor) and may be remunerated for it.

(xi) A director who to his knowledge is in any way, whether directly or indirectly, interested in a
contract with the Issuer shall declare the nature of his interest at a meeting of the Directors.

(xii) A director shall not vote or be counted in the quorum at a meeting in respect of any resolution
concerning his own appointment (including fixing and varying its terms), or the termination of his
own appointment, as the holder of any office or place of profit with the Issuer or any other Issuer in
which the Issuer is interested but, where proposals are under consideration concerning the
appointment (including fixing or varying its terms), or the termination of the appointment of two
or more Directors to offices or places of profit with the Issuer or any Issuer in which the Issuer is
interested, those proposals may be divided and considered in relation to each director separately;
and in such case each of the Directors concerned (if not otherwise debarred from voting under the
articles of association) shall be entitled to vote and be counted in the quorum in respect of each
resolution except that concerning his own appointment or the termination of his own appointment.

(xiii) A director shall not vote (or be counted in the quorum at a meeting) in respect of any contract in
which he has an interest which (together with any interest of a connected person) is to his
knowledge a material interest. Notwithstanding the above, a director shall be entitled to vote (and
be counted in the quorum) on: (aa) any contract in which he is interested by virtue of an interest in
shares, debentures or other securities of the Issuer or otherwise in or through the Issuer; (bb) the
giving of any guarantee, security or indemnity in respect of money lent or obligations incurred by
him or by any other person at the request of, or for the benefit of, the Issuer or any of its subsidiary
undertakings; or a debt or obligation of the Issuer or any of its subsidiary undertakings for which
he himself has assumed responsibility under a guarantee or indemnity or by the giving of security;
(cc) any issue or offer of shares, debentures or other securities of the Issuer or any of its subsidiary
undertakings in respect of which he is or may be entitled to participate in his capacity as holder of
any such securities or as an underwriter or sub-underwriter; (dd) any contract concerning another
Issuer in which he and any connected person do not to his knowledge hold an interest in shares
(within the meaning of sections 198 to 211 of the Act) representing one per cent. or more of the
issued shares of any class of such Issuer or of the voting rights of that Issuer; (ee) any arrangement
for the benefit of employees of the Issuer or any of its subsidiary undertakings which does not
accord to him any privilege or benefit not generally accorded to the employees to whom the
arrangement relates; and (ff) the purchase or maintenance of insurance for the benefit of Directors
or for the benefit of persons including Directors.

(g) Borrowing powers

The board may exercise all the powers of the Issuer to borrow money, and to mortgage or charge its
undertakings, property and assets (present and future) and uncalled capital, and to issue debentures,
debenture stock and other securities whether outright or as collateral security for any debt, liability or
obligation of the Issuer or of any third party.

The Directors shall restrict the borrowings of the Issuer and exercise all rights exercisable by the Issuer
in relation to its subsidiaries so as to secure (as regards subsidiaries, so far as by such exercise it can
secure) that the aggregate amount for the time being remaining outstanding of all moneys borrowed by
the group (which expression in this sub-paragraph means the Issuer and its subsidiaries for the time
being) and for the time being owing (subject as set out in the relevant article) to persons outside the
group shall not at any time, without the previous sanction of an ordinary resolution of the Issuer in
general meeting, exceed an amount equal to two and a half times the adjusted capital and reserves.

To date no resolution of the type referred to in this paragraph has been passed.


-----

(h) Unclaimed dividends

Any dividend unclaimed for a period of 12 years after having been declared shall automatically be
forfeited and cease to remain owing by the Issuer.

8. Issuer’s share schemes and details of outstanding options and awards under the Issuer’s share
schemes

The following is a summary of the principal terms of the Issuer’s share schemes (together the Cable &
Wireless Share Schemes):

8.1 Summary of the main features of the Incentive Plan 2001

The following is a summary of the main features of the Incentive Plan 2001 (the Plan). The Plan comprises
four elements:

s Share Option Plan;

s Performance Share Plan;

s Restricted Share Plan; and

s Stock Appreciation Rights.

The Plan may operate in conjunction with a trust.

(a) Eligibility

Employees (including Executive Directors) of the Company and all companies which are under the
control of the Company or which are subsidiaries of it are eligible to participate in the Share Option
Plan, the Performance Share Plan, and the Restricted Share Plan. Actual participation will be
determined by the remuneration committee. Stock Appreciation Rights are only offered to employees
in circumstances where the taxation, legal or administrative implications of offering share options or
shares make it impossible or undesirable to use them.

(b) Share Option Plan

Participants: The Share Option Plan is the principal element under which awards are made annually to
the Executive Directors, other executives and other key staff. A separate schedule to the Plan allows the
Company to grant Inland Revenue approved share options in the UK.

Individual limits: The remuneration committee sets the upper limit for individual awards from time to
time with reference to local market practice. The Share Option Plan has a limit for individuals of
10 times salary for each annual grant. The remuneration committee has set an overriding annual limit of
six times salary for the Chief Executive and four times salary for the other Executive Directors. The
remuneration committee will return to shareholders for further approval if they wish to award annual
grants in excess of this level.

Performance conditions: Where it is appropriate in the local market, performance conditions are
attached either to the grant or exercise of options. Performance conditions are applied in determining
the levels of options granted to employees in the US, but are not applied to the vesting of such awards.

Share options granted to all employees outside of the US are subject to performance conditions. The
performance conditions are based upon the Company’s Total Shareholder Return measured against the
constituents of the FTSE Global Telecoms Sector Index between the third and fifth anniversaries of the
date of grant.

The remuneration committee has power to vary or waive performance conditions to take account of a
change of circumstances but only if the remuneration committee considers that the amended condition
is a fairer measure of the performance of the Company, Cable & Wireless Group, business unit or the
participant, and provided that the amended performance condition is not materially easier nor more
difficult to achieve than it was when the award was first granted. The remuneration committee reviews
the performance conditions prior to each grant to ensure that it is challenging and in line with best
practice and current ABI guidelines.

Vesting: For share options outside of the US, full vesting occurs only if the TSR performance of the
Company meets or exceeds the upper quartile measured against the constituents of the FTSE Global


-----

Telecoms Sector Index at the end of any month between the third and fifth anniversaries of the date of
grant. Where TSR performance meets the median, 50 per cent. of the initial award vests. A sliding scale
operates between median and upper quartile, and nothing vests for performance below median. If
performance conditions have not been met by the fifth anniversary of the date of grant, the options
lapse.

Whilst performance conditions are not attached to the vesting of share option to employees in the US,
25 per cent. of amounts to US employees vest on the first anniversary of the date of grants with a further
25 per cent. on each subsequent anniversary.

Option price: The option price is the average of middle market quotations (as derived from the Daily
Official List) for the five dealing days immediately preceding the date of grant.

(c) Performance Share Plan

Participants: Executive Directors of the Company and other top executives (approximately 100
participants). These individuals may also be granted awards under the Share Option Plan.

Level of awards: The level of any award is determined by the remuneration committee each year by
reference to total remuneration with a market peer group, subject to an overriding annual limit of one
times salary for the participant. No awards have been made under this plan since 2002.

Performance conditions: Performance conditions are always attached to awards of performance
shares. The performance measure is determined by the remuneration committee. The performance
conditions for the Performance Share Plan is based upon the Company’s Total Shareholder Return
measured against the constituents of the FTSE Global Telecoms Index on the third anniversary of the
date of the award.

Vesting: Vesting of award shares under the Performance Share Plan is subject to satisfaction of the
performance conditions. Full vesting occurs only if the TSR performance of the Company meets or
exceeds the upper quartile on the third anniversary of the date of the award. Where TSR performance
meets the median, 40 per cent. of the initial award vests. A sliding scale operates between median and
upper quartile, and nothing vests for TSR performance below the median. A dividend award
supplement operates on the Performance Share Plan. Dividends that would have been paid on the
performance shares which vests, will be regarded as having been re-invested in additional shares.

(d) Restricted Share Plan

Intended participants: Restricted shares are only awarded in exceptional circumstances such as to
attract key strategic individuals.

Level of awards: The remuneration committee sets the level and upper limit of awards.

Performance conditions: As the main aim of this incentive element is to attract key individuals and
compensate them for incentive arrangements lost upon joining the Company, the award of restricted
shares is not necessarily linked to the achievement of corporate performance conditions.

Vesting: The length of the vesting period is flexible and at the discretion of the remuneration
committee. No payment is made by a participant when an award is granted or vests.

(e) Stock Appreciation Rights

These are used to mirror the benefits from the three other elements of the Plan described above, but pay
out rewards in cash. These are used in countries where it is more tax effective not to use actual shares or
share options, or where the use of actual shares or share options is prevented or made difficult by local
legislation.

(f) Terms applicable to all elements of the Plan

(i) Limits on issue of new Shares: The number of new shares which may be issued under the Plan on
any day shall not, when added to the new shares issued or issuable under the Plan and any other
employees’ share scheme over the previous 10 years, exceed 10 per cent. of the ordinary share
capital of the Company in issue immediately before that day. The remuneration committee ensures
that the number of new shares which may be issued under the Plan on any day to the Executive
Directors and other top executives (approximately 100) when added to new shares issued, or still


-----

issuable, under the Plan and any other employees’ share scheme over the last 10 years pursuant to
grants or awards to individuals as members of that participant group, does not exceed 5 per cent. of
the ordinary share capital of the Company in issue immediately before that day. Existing shares do
not therefore count towards these limits, but new shares issued to trustees to enable them to satisfy
awards are taken into account.

(ii) Cessation of Employment: Awards generally lapse immediately when an employee ceases
employment. They do not lapse in certain specified circumstances, including where employment
ceases because of death, injury, disability, retirement, early retirement, redundancy and the
employing company or business ceasing to be within the group or in other circumstances at the
discretion of the remuneration committee. Performance conditions are treated as satisfied in these
specified circumstances.

(iii) Takeovers: If there is a takeover of the Company, a scheme of arrangement or similar other major
corporate events, awards under the Plan crystallise. If it is possible to determine at that time
whether the performance conditions are satisfied, awards will become exercisable or vest if the
performance conditions are satisfied during the period from the first day of the performance period
up to a date being no earlier than 30 days before the happening of the relevant event. If the
performance conditions are not satisfied, the remuneration committee’s consent is required as to
the extent to which, if at all, awards become exercisable or vest. If, in the opinion of the
remuneration committee, it is not possible to determine whether the performance conditions are
satisfied, the remuneration committee shall at its discretion determine the extent to which, if at all,
awards become exercisable or vest. Awards not subject to performance conditions vest in full. The
early vesting of awards will not apply where a company acquires control of the Company and
following that acquisition, the shareholders of the Company immediately prior to the acquisition
between them hold more than 50 per cent. of the issued share capital of the acquiring company,
unless the remuneration committee decides that the foregoing vesting rules should apply.

(iv) Variation of capital: If there is a capitalisation issue, rights issue, rights offer, sub-division,
consolidation or reduction of capital, demerger or any variation to the share capital of the
Company, the number of shares subject to an award will be adjusted in such a manner as the
remuneration committee determines and the auditors confirm to be fair and reasonable.

(v) Alterations: The remuneration committee may at any time alter or add to any of the provisions of
the Plan (with the prior consent of any trustees if they have made any awards). However, no
alteration or addition can be made to the provisions which relate to (i) the class of persons eligible
to participate in the Plan; (ii) the terms upon which ordinary shares may be transferred to a
participant under an award; (iii) the adjustments to awards in the event of a variation of capital;
and (iv) the amendment rule, without the prior approval by ordinary resolution of the Company’s
shareholders unless it is a minor alteration or addition which is to benefit the administration of the
Plan, is necessary or desirable in order to take account of any change in legislation or regulation,
or to obtain or maintain favourable taxation, exchange control, accounting or regulatory treatment
for the Company, any member of the Cable & Wireless Group or any participant. In addition the
prior approval by ordinary resolution of the Company’s shareholders will be sought for any
fundamental change to the Company’s policy as to the imposition of performance conditions or
the performance measure or to the basis for determining the level of awards.

(g) Overseas Aspects

The Board may amend or alter the provisions of the Plan and the terms of awards as it considers
necessary or desirable to take account of or mitigate or comply with laws or regulations of any
jurisdiction, country or territory other than Great Britain. This may be by way of a separate schedule or
schedules to the main Plan.

8.2 Summary of the main features of the Deferred Short Term Incentive Plan

The following is a summary of the main features of the Deferred Short Term Incentive Plan.

(a) Initially participants will be Executive Directors of the Company. They are given the opportunity, but
are not obliged, to defer up to 50 per cent. of any Short Term Incentive Plan bonus earned into ordinary
shares of the Company. The deferred bonus is used to purchase shares in the market place (purchased
shares) and these are held by trustees. Subject to the achievement of further performance criteria
participants are awarded ‘‘matching shares’’ without further payment.


-----

(b) It is intended that performance conditions will always attach to matching shares. The performance
measure is determined by the remuneration committee. Initially the performance measure attached to
the vesting of matching shares is Total Shareholder Return measured against the constituents of the
FTSE Global Telecoms Sector Index over three years. The number of matching shares received will
depend upon the extent to which the performance conditions have been satisfied. Matching shares will
be awarded on the basis of one matching share for two purchased shares for median performance, rising
to two matching shares for each purchased share for upper quartile performance. No matching shares
will be awarded for performance below median.

(c) Purchased and matching shares are released to participants after three years.

(d) A dividend award supplement will apply to the Plan. Dividends that would have been paid on the
purchased shares and the actual award of matching shares during the performance period are reinvested
in additional shares at the prevailing market price of an ordinary share as at the payment date of the
respective dividends.

(e) The terms described above under the Incentive Plan arrangements relating to Plan limits, cessation of
employment, takeovers, variation of capital, alterations and overseas aspects apply similarly to this
Plan.

8.3 Summary of the main features of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The following is a summary of the main features of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the US Plan).

(a) The US Plan is a savings related plan offered to US employees of the Cable & Wireless Group. Under
the US Plan employees can contribute to a special account up to US$800 per payroll period. At the end
of a year long savings period the savings are used to buy ordinary shares in the Company in the form of
American Depositary Shares (ADSs). ADSs are the form in which the Company’s ordinary shares are
traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The purchase price of each ADS is 85 per cent. of the market
price of an ADS at the beginning of the savings period. The US Plan permits participants to withdraw
their accumulated savings at any time prior to the actual purchase of shares.

(b) The US Plan is structured so as to meet the requirements of section 423 of the US Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, which provides certain tax advantages to participants.

(c) Eligibility

All employees of Cable & Wireless Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries, other than certain part time and
other employees identified in the US Plan, are eligible to participate.

(d) Scheme Limits

The maximum number of shares that may be purchased under the US Plan is 10 million ordinary
shares.

(e) Cessation of Employment

Employees who leave the employment of a US subsidiary during a savings period will generally have
their contributions refunded and will not be entitled to acquire any ADSs under the US Plan. In the
event of retirement or death the participant’s beneficiary may elect to purchase the ADSs at the end of
the savings period.

(f) Amendments to the US Plan

Amendments to the US Plan may be made by the board of Cable & Wireless Holdings, Inc. or the board
of the Company, but no amendment may be made which would cause the US Plan not to meet the
requirements of section 423.


-----

8.4 Summary of the main features of the Share Purchase Plan

The following is a summary of the Share Purchase Plan, which is a Share Incentive Plan. The Share
Purchase Plan operates in conjunction with a UK resident trust.

(a) Eligibility

All employees (including Executive Directors) of the Company and any participating subsidiary and
who are chargeable to income tax under Section 15 Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 are
eligible to participate in the Share Purchase Plan. The Directors may also include other employees.
Each time the Share Purchase Plan is operated, the Directors can decide whether to offer partnership,
free or matching shares. Currently the Share Purchase Plan is operated over partnership and dividend
shares.

(b) Partnership Shares

Employees may be invited to buy partnership shares out of pre-tax salary. This is limited to an amount
of pre-tax salary, currently £125 per month or 10 per cent. of salary each month, whichever is the lower.
The shares are purchased monthly. The shares may be withdrawn from the Share Purchase Plan at any
time but there may be PAYE and national insurance contributions payable upon such an event unless
the participant is leaving employment on account of injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or death,
or the shares have been in the Share Purchase Plan for at least five years.

(c) Matching Shares

The Directors may offer additional matching shares based on the number of partnership shares bought
by an employee. Not more than two matching shares may be offered for each partnership share bought.
As with partnership shares, the matching shares are held in trust and may be withdrawn at any time.
There are PAYE and national insurance liabilities on the employee if the shares are withdrawn within
five years unless the employee leaves employment on account of injury, disability, redundancy,
retirement or death.

(d) Free Shares

Employees may be given free shares with a market value of up to £3,000 each year per individual (or
the Inland Revenue limit if different). All allocations must generally be offered on similar terms. An
award may be subject to objective performance targets to be satisfied in the period before allocation.
The shares would be held in trust for up to five years and there would be PAYE and national insurance
liabilities for the participant if shares are withdrawn earlier except in the event of the employee leaving
employment on account of injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or death.

(e) Dividend Shares

The Share Purchase Plan will allow for the reinvestment of cash dividends, currently up to £1,500 per
year paid on shares held in the trust, to be applied in the purchase of additional shares for a participating
employee, to be held on tax advantageous terms.

(f) Plan Limits

The Share Purchase Plan is currently operated using existing shares purchased in the market. However,
the Directors have the authority to use new shares, in which case any allocation of shares will count
against the limits on the number of new shares which may be issued under the Company’s employees’
share plans. In particular, there is a limit of 10 per cent. of the issued ordinary share capital under all
plans over any 10 year period.

(g) Alterations

The Directors may change the rules and trust deed of the Share Purchase Plan with the approval of the
Share Purchase Plan trustee. However, shareholder approval is required for changes which are to the
advantage of employees and which relate to eligibility; the individual limits on taking part; the overall
limits on the issuing of shares; the rights attaching to shares received; the rights of participants upon
any variation of share capital; and the amendment rule itself.


-----

The Directors will not, however, need to obtain shareholder approval if the changes are minor and are
to do with the administration of the Share Purchase Plan, a change in the law, or intended to obtain or
keep favourable tax treatment, exchange control or regulatory treatment for employees or the
Company. The directors cannot change the terms of the Share Purchase Plan or the trust deed whilst
they are approved by the Inland Revenue, unless the Inland Revenue so agrees.

8.5 Summary of the main features of the Savings Related Share Option Plan

The following is a summary of the Savings Related Share Option Plan (Sharesave Plan). The existing Plan
will expire on 20th July, 2003. A proposal to adopt a new UK Sharesave Plan, similar to the existing plan, is
being put to the shareholders for approval at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 25th July, 2003.

(a) Eligibility

All UK resident employees and full-time Executive Directors of participating members of the Cable &
Wireless Group may apply for options under the Sharesave Plan whenever it is operated. The board
may permit other employees to participate. The Sharesave Plan has been approved by the Inland
Revenue.

(b) Grant of options

Invitations to participate in the Sharesave Plan may normally only be issued during the period of 42
days following the announcement of results for the Company for any period.

(c) Option exercise price and individual limits on participation

The exercise price of options may not be less than (i) 80 per cent. of the average middle market
quotation of a Company share derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List on the five
dealing days immediately before the date of grant; or (ii) in the case of any option under which the
Company’s shares are to be issued, the nominal value of a share.

At the time of receiving options, participants must enter into a savings contract with a nominated
savings institution under which they agree to make monthly contributions of between £5 and £250 (or
any higher amount permitted by legislation) from their pay. The number of Company shares over which
a participant is granted an option will be the number that can be acquired at the exercise price with the
savings made, plus a bonus payable on maturity of the savings contract.

(d) Overall limit on participation

The number of new shares which may be issued under the Sharesave Plan on any day shall not, when
added to the new shares issued or issuable under the Plan and any other employees’ share scheme
operated by the Company over the previous 10 years exceed 10 per cent. of the ordinary share capital of
the Company in issue immediately before that day.

(e) Exercise of options

Options may normally only be exercised in the six month period following the maturity date of the
related savings contract. This may be after the third, fifth or seventh anniversary of the date of grant.

(f) Termination of employment

In certain circumstances, early exercise of options is permitted in respect of the number of Company
shares that may be acquired using the proceeds of the partially completed savings contract. Examples of
these circumstances are where the participant leaves employment with the Cable & Wireless Group in
circumstances of death, disability, injury or redundancy (within the meaning of the Employment Rights
Act 1996), or upon reaching age 60, or where the Company is taken over or reorganised or where the
business or subsidiary for which the participant works ceases to be part of the Cable & Wireless Group.
If a participant leaves employment with the Cable & Wireless Group other than in any special
circumstances his option will lapse.

(g) Takeover

If any person obtains control of the Company as a result of making an offer to acquire the whole of its
issued share capital (or, having such control, makes a general offer to acquire all the shares other than


-----

those already owned by that person) participants will have six months within which to exercise their
options; thereafter, they will lapse. If a person becomes bound or entitled to give notice to acquire the
Company’s shares under sections 428 to 430F of the Act, a Participant may exercise his options during
the period when that person remains so bound or entitled; thereafter they will lapse.

Participants may, in certain circumstances, be given the opportunity to exchange their options for
options over ordinary shares in an acquiring company.

If the Company is reconstructed or wound up, options outstanding under the Sharesave Plan will be
exercisable within specified time limits and will then lapse.

(h) Adjustment of options

If there is a variation in the share capital of the Company, including by way of a capitalisation or rights
issue, consolidation, sub-division or a reduction in share capital, the number of shares under option and
the exercise price may be adjusted by the board with the approval of the Inland Revenue where the
auditors confirm in writing that such an adjustment is, in their opinion, fair and reasonable.

(i) Amending the Sharesave Plan

The rules of the Sharesave Plan can be amended at any time by the board with the approval of the
Inland Revenue.

However, no amendment to the advantage of eligible employees or participants can be made without
the prior approval of the Company in general meeting if the amendment relates to the provisions in the
rules relating to eligibility, limits on the number of shares available for issue under the Sharesave Plan,
the basis for determining a Participant’s entitlement to shares and any adjustment in the event of a
variation in the share capital of the Company, unless the alteration or addition is minor in nature and
made to benefit the administration of the Sharesave Plan, to comply with the provisions of any existing
or proposed legislation affecting the Sharesave Plan or to obtain or maintain favourable tax, exchange
control or regulatory treatment for employees and participants or for the Company or any member of
the Company’s group. In addition, no amendment that would materially prejudice the interests of
existing Participants may be made without the prior consent of participants holding three-quarters of
the aggregate number of shares subject to outstanding options. Any changes are subject to the prior
approval of the Inland Revenue.

(j) The Global Share Option Scheme

The Company has extended its sharesave scheme to its overseas employees (with the exception of those
in the US). It operates along similar lines to the Sharesave Plan with local variances to accommodate
local legal and tax considerations. The existing Scheme will expire on 20th July, 2003. A proposal to
adopt a new Global Sharesave Scheme, similar to the expiring Scheme, is being put to the shareholders
for approval at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 25th July, 2003.

8.6 Closed Plans

Details of plans which are now closed but under which awards outstanding may still vest are as follows:

Prior to July 2001 the Company granted share options under the C&W Senior Employees’ Share Option
Plan (SESOS) and the C&W Revenue Approved Share Option Plan (RESOS). Options awarded under these
plans between June 1999 and July 2001 are subject to performance conditions based on Cable & Wireless’
TSR performance relative to the FTSE 100 Index, underpinned by real growth in EBITDA and turnover. For
full vesting, Cable & Wireless’ TSR must achieve at least upper quartile level against the FTSE 100 between
the third and fifth anniversaries of the date of grant. Half vesting applies for TSR at the median level, with a
sliding scale between median and upper quartile. If the performance conditions are not met by the fifth
anniversary of the date of grant, the options lapse. As at the date of this report, no such options have
achieved their performance conditions.

RESOS and SESOS options granted before June 1999 became exercisable if growth in the Company’s
published Earnings Per Share (excluding exceptional items) measured over any period of three consecutive
financial years, commencing not earlier than the financial year in which the option was granted, exceeded by
not less than 6 per cent. the percentage growth of the Retail Price Index over the same three year period. All
such options became exercisable in full. No further grants will be made under the SESOS or RESOS plans.

So long as his appointment continues, Richard Lapthorne will acquire from the Company 200,000 Ordinary
Shares in the Company (the Annual Acquisition of Shares) on the following dates at the lower of the midmarket price or:

(a) 10th January, 2004 – 57 pence per Ordinary Share;

(b) 10th January, 2005 – 63 pence per Ordinary Share;

(c) 10th January 2006 – 78 pence per Ordinary Share; and

(d) Each subsequent anniversary with the price increasing 15 pence per Ordinary Share.

It is intended that Richard Lapthorne will retain all of these Ordinary Shares for the duration of his
appointment.

The following share incentive arrangements for Bernard Gray, Graham Howe, Dr Janet Morgan, Anthony
Rice and Kasper Rorsted were made to secure or retain their appointments as Non-executive Directors of the
Company given the general turmoil in the telecommunications industry, the associated decline in the share
price of the Company and the re-structuring of the Company’s Board of Directors.

Each of these Non-executive Directors will purchase a specified number of Ordinary Shares in the Company
on 4th June, 2004, and on the anniversary of this date until 4th June, 2006 inclusive:

Number of
Director Ordinary Shares

Bernard Gray 100,000
Graham Howe 100,000
Dr Janet Morgan 30,000
Anthony Rice 100,000
Kasper Rorsted 30,000

The Purchase price for the Ordinary Shares to be purchased on 4th June, 2004, 4th June, 2005 and 4th June
2006 shall be the lower of the closing mid-market price on such dates or the closing mid-market price on 4th
June, 2003 which was 103.5 pence per share.

Save as set out in this paragraph 10 of this section, it is not expected that any Director will have any interest
in the share or loan capital of the Issuer on Admission and there is no person to whom any capital of any
member of the Group is under option or agreed unconditionally to be put under option.

No Director has or has had any interest in any transactions which are or were unusual in their nature or
conditions or are or were significant to the business of the Group and which were effected by the Issuer
during the current or immediately preceding financial year or during an earlier financial year and which
remain in any respect outstanding or unperformed.

10.3 Directors’ remuneration

The aggregate emoluments of the Directors, were £3,226,142, including emoluments of £807,087 paid to
Directors who resigned during the year ended 31st March, 2003 (2002 – £2,634,369, which includes
emoluments of £387,049 paid to Directors who resigned during the year ended 31st March, 2002).

10.4 Loans and guarantees granted to Directors

As at 31st March, 2003 the total outstanding loans made by any member of the Group to the Directors was
£Nil and the total amount of indebtedness of the Directors guaranteed by any member of the Group was

STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of preparation

The accounts are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and on the historical cost
basis except for the revaluation of investments in subsidiaries in the Company’s accounts.

The accompanying consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United Kingdom (UK GAAP).

The preparation of Financial Statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

New accounting standards

The Group sells network capacity to third parties pursuant to indefeasible rights-of-use agreements (IRUs).
In prior periods, in accordance with UK accounting standards, where substantially all of the risks and rewards of
ownership transfer to the purchaser, over the economic life of the asset, these transactions were accounted for as
sales and recognised in turnover at fair value at the time of delivery and acceptance.

On 27 March 2003, the Urgent Issues Task Force (UITF) of the UK Accounting Standards Board issued
UITF Abstract 36, ‘Contracts for sales of capacity’. The abstract is applicable for accounting periods ending on or
after 30 June 2003, although early adoption is encouraged, and application is retrospective. The Group has
adopted UITF Abstract 36 for the year ended 31 March 2003.

As a result of the adoption of the new abstract, revenues or gains in respect of capacity sales to carriers from
whom capacity or other services were also acquired are no longer recognised as the transactions are not
considered to meet all the conditions required under the new abstract, in particular the requirement for the
capacity provided or received to have a readily ascertainable market value as set out in Financial Reporting
Standard 10 ‘Goodwill and intangible assets’. The Group’s cash sales to carriers with no related purchase are
largely unaffected by the conditions of the new abstract and will continue to be recognised at the time of delivery
and acceptance.

The impact of adoption on the reported results of the Group is set out in Note 4 to the Financial Statements,
including the impact on prior period comparatives as the abstract applies retrospectively. The revised accounting
policy is set out on page F-10.

Basis of consolidation

The Group accounts comprise a consolidation of the accounts of the Company and all its subsidiaries and
include the Group’s share of the results and net assets of its joint ventures and associates. The accounts of
principal subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are made up to 31 March.

Where subsidiaries, joint ventures or associates have been acquired during the year, goodwill, being the
difference between the fair value of consideration given and the fair values attributed to the separable net assets
acquired, is capitalised on the balance sheet and amortised through the profit and loss account.

For acquisitions made before 1 April 1998, goodwill was written off directly to reserves. Goodwill written
off directly to reserves is reinstated in the profit and loss account when the related business is sold.

Foreign currencies

Average rates of exchange ruling during the year are used to translate the profit and loss accounts of overseas
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates. Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated at year end rates
and any exchange differences arising are dealt with through the profit and loss account.

The net investments in the Group’s overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are translated into
sterling at year end rates of exchange. Exchange differences resulting from the translation of opening net
investments at rates ruling at the beginning and end of the year, together with the differences between profit and
loss accounts translated at average rates and year end rates, are dealt with as movements in Group reserves.

Where net investments are matched in whole or in part by foreign currency borrowings, the exchange
differences arising on the retranslation of such borrowings are also recorded as movements on Group reserves and
any excess taken to the profit and loss account.


-----

All other exchange differences are dealt with through the profit and loss account.

Tangible fixed assets and depreciation

Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less depreciation. The cost of fixed assets includes directly
attributable labour and overhead costs. Interest incurred up to the time that separately identifiable major capital
projects are ready for service is also capitalised as part of the cost of assets.

Depreciation is not provided on freehold land or projects under construction. On other tangible fixed assets,
depreciation is provided on the difference between the cost of tangible fixed assets and the estimated residual
value, in equal annual instalments over the estimated useful lives of the assets. These lives are:

Lives Average

Cables. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . up to 20 years 15 years
Network equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 to 25 years 8 years
Ducting. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 40 years 40 years
Freehold buildings. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 40 years 40 years
Leasehold land and buildings. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . up to 40 years or term of lease if less 40 years

Surpluses and deficits on disposals of tangible fixed assets are determined by reference to sale proceeds and
net book values.

Intangible fixed assets

From 1 April 1998 intangible fixed assets acquired have been recorded at cost and amortised on a straight
line basis over their estimated useful life, not exceeding 20 years. Intangible fixed assets primarily comprise
goodwill arising on the acquisition of businesses.

Goodwill arising on acquisition prior to 1 April 1998 was eliminated directly against reserves. The profit or
loss on the disposal of all or part of a previously acquired business is calculated after taking account of the gross
amount of any goodwill previously eliminated directly against reserves.

Asset impairment

Intangible and tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of the fixed asset may not be recoverable. Where an impairment indicator is
identified, the carrying value of the income generating unit is compared with its recoverable amount. Where the
recoverable amount is less than the carrying value an impairment is recognised.

Fixed asset investments

Joint ventures and associates are accounted for in the Group accounts under the gross equity and equity
methods of accounting respectively.

Other fixed asset investments in the Group accounts are stated at cost less amounts written off in respect of
any impairments.

Investments in subsidiaries are included in the Company balance sheet at valuation.

Current asset investments

Current asset investments are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

Tax

The charge for tax is based on the result for the year and takes into account tax deferred due to timing
differences between the treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable. Deferred tax assets are
regarded as recoverable to the extent that on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely
than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing
differences can be deducted.

Except where otherwise required by accounting standards, full provision without discounting is made for all
timing differences which have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date.


-----

Stocks

Stocks of equipment, held for use in the maintenance and expansion of the Group’s telecommunications
systems, are stated at cost, including appropriate allocation of labour and overheads, less provision for
deterioration and obsolescence. Stocks held for resale are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

Discontinued operations

The Group complies with Financial Reporting Standard 3 (FRS 3), ‘Reporting financial performance’, in
determining the classification of operations as discontinued or continuing.

Revenue recognition

Turnover, which excludes value added tax, represents the amount receivable in respect of
telecommunications services provided to customers and is accounted for on the accruals basis. Amounts are
recognised as services are provided; in respect of services invoiced in advance, amounts are deferred until
provision of the service.

Interconnection with other operators

Amounts payable by and to telecommunications operators of national and international networks are
recognised as services are provided. Charges are negotiated separately and are subject to continuous review.

Capacity sales

Sales of network capacity to third parties pursuant to IRUs are accounted for as sales and recognised at the
time of delivery and acceptance where:

s the purchaser’s right of use is exclusive and irrevocable;

s the asset is specific and separable;

s the term of the contract is for the major part of the asset’s useful economic life;

s the attributable cost of carrying value can be measured reliably; and

s no significant risks are retained by the Group.

Capacity sales are made out of network capacity and infrastructure held for re-sale (stock). Transfers are
made from fixed assets to stock at cost on completion of construction based on an estimate of what will be sold to
third parties under IRU contracts (which typically form part of the original investment criteria). The cost of the
construction is apportioned on a pro rata basis between stock and fixed assets. Income relating to operations and
maintenance contracts is spread over the period of the contract.

Revenues or gains in respect of contracts involving the provision of capacity in exchange for receiving
capacity, or other services, are not recognised on the basis that the capacity does not have a readily ascertainable
market value as defined in accounting standards.

Pensions

The regular cost of providing benefits under defined benefit schemes is charged to operating profit over the
expected remaining service lives of the members of the schemes so as to achieve a constant percentage of
pensionable pay. Variations from the regular cost arising from periodic actuarial valuations of the principal
defined benefit schemes are allocated to operating profit over the expected remaining service lives of the
members.

The cost of providing benefits under defined contribution schemes is charged as it becomes payable.

The Group has applied the transitional arrangements of Financial Reporting Standard 17 (FRS 17)
‘Retirement benefits’ and appropriate additional disclosures have been included in Note 8.

Leased assets

Where assets are financed by leasing agreements that give rights approximating to ownership, the assets are
treated as if they had been purchased outright. The amount capitalised is the present value of the minimum lease
payments payable during the lease term. The corresponding lease commitments are shown as obligations to the
lessor. Lease payments are split between capital and interest elements using the annuity method. Depreciation on


-----

the relevant assets and interest are charged to the profit and loss account. All other leases are operating leases and
the rentals are charged to operating profit on a straight line basis over the lease term.

Debt issue costs

The costs of issue of capital instruments such as bonds and debentures are charged to the profit and loss
account over the life of the instrument.

Derivatives

Swaps and forward rate agreements

The net interest paid or received under interest rate and cross currency swaps and forward rate agreements
(FRAs) is recorded on an accruals basis and included within net interest in the profit and loss account.

The notional amounts of interest rate swaps and FRAs are not recorded on the balance sheet. Cross currency
swaps are used to hedge the initial draw down and final repayment of foreign currency denominated debt, as well
as the foreign currency interest flows.

Forward exchange contracts

Forward exchange contracts are carried on the balance sheet at the difference between the amounts of the
payable and receivable currency revalued at the closing exchange rate. The interest differential, being the
difference between the contract rate and the spot rate on the date of entering into the forward exchange contract,
is charged to the profit and loss account as interest over the life of the contract.

Exchange gains and losses

Exchange gains and losses on revaluation and maturity of forward exchange contracts and cross currency
swaps are treated differently depending on the underlying exposure they hedge:

s for contracts which hedge firm third party commitments the exchange gains and losses are recognised in
the profit and loss account in the same period as the underlying transaction;

s for contracts over underlying currency assets or liabilities the exchange gains and losses are off-set against
the equal and opposite exchange gains or losses arising on the retranslation of the underlying assets or
liabilities;

s for contracts taken out to hedge overseas equity investments the exchange gains and losses are taken to
reserves to off-set against the exchange differences arising on the retranslation of the net assets of the
investments on consolidation; and

s for contracts which hedge general trading flows the exchange gains or losses are taken to the profit and
loss account in the period in which they arise.

Where the underlying exposure changes, or ceases to exist, the contract would be terminated and the
exchange gain or loss arising taken to the profit and loss account.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Company’s profit and loss account

The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in the Companies Act 1985 from presenting
its own profit and loss account. The loss for the year of the Company amounted to £7,639 million (2002 – loss of
£6,696 million, 2001 – profit of £810 million).

2. Historical cost profits and losses

There is no difference between the Group results as reported and on the historical cost basis. Accordingly no
additional note of historical cost profits and losses has been prepared.

3. Turnover

The Group’s operations are all considered to fall into one class of business, namely telecommunications.

4. Segmental information

Cable & Wireless is an international telecommunications company. During the periods presented it operated
through two segments, Cable & Wireless Global and Cable & Wireless Regional, which can be further analysed
by geographic area. Cable & Wireless Global provides communication solutions to business and wholesale
customers. It offers IP, data and voice products with a focus on IP and data, centred on the key markets of US,
Europe (including UK) and Japan. Cable & Wireless Regional provides a full range of telecommunications
services to both consumer and business customers, including fixed and mobile voice, data and IP. The major
businesses in this segment are in the Caribbean and Panama, but it also includes operations in Macau, the Middle
East, South East Asia and in the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic Oceans.

Details of Group turnover, contributions to operating (loss)/profit, net operating assets/(liabilities) by
geographical region are as follows:

The Group turnover figure disclosed represents turnover of the Company and its subsidiaries allocated to the
location to which the Group invoices its services. This is generally the same as the location to which
telecommunications services are supplied. It does not follow, however, that international telecommunications
traffic which the Group may be responsible for carrying on part of its route would necessarily originate in that
location. The Group does not have access to information on the original source or ultimate destination of
international telecommunications traffic.

Turnover for 2001 and 2002 has been adjusted to reflect the introduction of UITF Abstract 36 ‘Contracts for
sales of capacity’ (see below) and for operations now classified as discontinued.


-----

Discontinued operations comprise sales in the US in 2003 of £144 million (2002 – US £281 million and
Australia £764 million, 2001 – US £354 million, Australia £1,815 million, Hong Kong £878 million and UK
£116 million).

The Company has adopted UITF Abstract 36 for the year ended 31 March 2003. The requirements of UITF
Abstract 36 have been incorporated into a revised accounting policy for capacity sales. Accordingly the amounts
for the current and corresponding periods have been updated on the basis of the new accounting policy. The
impact of this change for the 12 months to 31 March 2003 is to decrease turnover by £nil (2002 – £163 million,
2001 – £248 million) in respect of sales made to carriers from whom capacity was also acquired, and to decrease
cost of sales by £nil (2002 – £76 million, 2001 – £123 million). In respect of capacity purchases from carriers to
whom Cable & Wireless also sold capacity, the net impact is to decrease the impairment charge in 2002 by
£105 million, decrease the depreciation charge in 2003 by £2 million (2002 – £12 million, 2001 – £9 million) and
decrease exceptional operating costs by £3 million (2002 – £128 million, 2001 – £nil). The impact on profit for
the year ended 31 March 2003 is an increase of £6 million (2002 – increase of £168 million, 2001 – decrease of
£117 million). The cumulative effect of adopting UITF Abstract 36 was to decrease net assets by £66 million as
at 31 March 2002.

Cash capacity sales of £nil (2002 – £29 million, 2001 – £91 million) are included within Group turnover,
with attributable cost of sales of £nil (2002 – £10 million, 2001 – £37 million). Revenue from operating and
maintenance and similar services relating to capacity was £11 million (2002 – £37 million, 2001 – £30 million),
with cost of sales of £2 million (2002 – £16 million, 2001 – £13 million).

7. Directors’ remuneration and shareholdings

Information covering Directors’ remuneration (including pension entitlements), interest in shares and
interests in share options (including in each case those arising under the Share Option Plan and Performance
Share Plan) is included in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 65 to 78 of the Issuer’s 2003 Annual
Report.

8. Pensions

Defined benefit schemes

The Company and its principal subsidiaries operate pension and other retirement schemes which cover the
majority of employees in the Group. These schemes include both the defined benefit type, whereby retirement
benefits are based on the employees’ final remuneration and length of service, and defined contribution schemes,
whereby retirement benefits reflect the accumulated value of agreed contributions paid by, and in respect of,
employees. With the exception of the unfunded, unapproved retirement benefit schemes, the remaining schemes
are funded through separate trustee administered schemes. Contributions to the defined benefit schemes are made
in accordance with the recommendations of independent actuaries who value the schemes at regular intervals,
usually triennially.

An actuarial valuation of the principal United Kingdom defined benefit pension scheme (the Scheme) was
prepared at 31 March 2002 for the purpose of UK Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 (SSAP 24)
‘Accounting for pension costs’.

The valuation of the Scheme disclosed a shortfall in the market value of the Scheme’s assets compared with
the accrued liabilities. This was principally due to the fall in the Scheme’s asset values following the fall in global
equity markets between 1 April 1999 and 31 March 2002. Thus, with agreement from the actuary, the Company
increased its contributions to the Scheme to 20 per cent. of salary with effect from 1 April 2002, and made a oneoff contribution to the Scheme of £47 million in December 2002 in respect of the shortfall.

The Scheme was valued using the projected unit method and the principal assumptions were that future
investment returns on existing assets would, on average, be 3.2 per cent. a year above the level of price inflation,
that the return on new investments would be 3.9 per cent. a year above price inflation, that general salary growth
would be 1.7 per cent. a year above price inflation, and that inflation related pension increases would generally be


-----

in line with price inflation. The market value of the Scheme’s investments at the valuation date was £1,401
million. The Scheme also holds some insurance policies which have an assessed value of £11 million. The total
value of the assets was 97 per cent. of the value of the aggregate benefits that had accrued to members of the
Scheme, allowing for expected future earnings increases in the case of employees.

The assumptions used for calculating the pension cost for accounting purposes differ from the funding
assumptions in that the assumed return on existing assets is 3.3 per cent. a year above price inflation. In the
financial statements, the deficit in the Scheme is spread over the remaining service lives of the employed
members. Under those assumptions as at 31 March 2002, the total value of the investments was 99 per cent. of the
value of the aggregate benefits that had accrued to members of the Scheme.

Pension schemes other than the principal scheme are accounted for on the basis of local custom and practice.
Pension prepayments relating to the Scheme of £112 million (2002 – £72 million, 2001 – £64 million) are
included in other debtors (Note 20). Provisions for obligations to pay terminal gratuities on retirement to staff
who are not members of the pension and retirement schemes are included in provisions for pensions (Note 23).

Defined contribution schemes

The pension cost for the year for the defined contribution schemes was £19 million (2002 – £10 million,
2001 – £26 million).

Disclosures in respect of Financial Reporting Standard 17 (FRS 17) – ‘Retirement benefits’

The above figures have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of SSAP 24. The UK has
published FRS 17, however, its full introduction has been deferred. The accounting requirements of FRS 17 are
broadly as follows:

s pension scheme assets are valued at market values at the balance sheet date;

s pension scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit method and discounted at the current rate
of return on high quality (AA) corporate bonds of equivalent term and currency to the liability;

s for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 the pension scheme surplus (to the extent it
is considered recoverable) or deficit will be recognised in full and presented on the face of the balance
sheet; and

s the movement in the scheme surplus/deficit will be split between operating charges, financing items
and, in the statement of total recognised gains and losses, actuarial gains and losses.

The transitional disclosures in respect of FRS 17 are set out below:

Qualified independent actuaries, Watson Wyatt LLP, updated the actuarial valuations of the major defined
benefit schemes operated by the Group to 31 March 2003. The main financial assumptions in accordance with

assumptions which may not necessarily be borne out in practice. The assumptions shown above for the Rest of
Group represent a weighted average of the assumptions used for the individual funds.

The UK defined benefit scheme is closed to new entrants and under the projected unit method for closed
schemes the current service cost will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.

The assets and liabilities of the defined benefit schemes operated by the Group are as follows:

3,226 (340) 12 2,898

Year ended 31 March 2003

(i) The Group announced a restructuring of the Cable & Wireless Global business on 13 November 2002.
Exceptional costs in the period of £248 million associated with this restructuring include £182 million in
respect of property costs, £52 million in respect of redundancy costs and £14 million of other costs.

Other exceptional costs relate to integration costs of Digital Island and the business activities of Exodus of
£31 million, redundancy costs of £38 million principally in Cable & Wireless Regional, £44 million of
provisions in respect of rentals on vacant properties and £81 million in respect of onerous network contracts
and distressed carrier asset write offs (Cable & Wireless Global £159 million, Cable & Wireless Regional
£35 million).

(ii) The Group has carried out a review to determine whether there has been an impairment of its fixed assets
and goodwill. The carrying values of fixed assets and goodwill of each of the Group’s income generating
units have been compared to their recoverable amounts, represented by their value in use to the Group. The
charge has been determined in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 11 (FRS 11) ‘Impairment of
fixed assets and goodwill’ which involves amongst other factors using a growth rate of 2.5 per cent after five
years (based on a nominal increase in GDP for the countries in which the Group operates), and a discount
rate of 14 per cent. The resulting charge in Cable & Wireless Global is £10 million. Other operations
£2 million in respect of goodwill and £1,479 million in respect of fixed assets. This charge is in addition to
the charge of £2,713 million in respect of goodwill and £787 million in respect of fixed assets recognised at
the half year. Exceptional depreciation also includes the write-off of redundant fixed assets of £58 million.
Tax credits of £48 million are available on the Cable & Wireless Regional impairment charges of
£191 million which was disclosed in the 2002 Group Financial Statements.

(iii) The Group has exited its US retail voice business, as announced on 15 May 2002. The exceptional costs
associated with this amount to £288 million and include exit costs of £200 million, redundant fixed asset
write downs of £57 million included in the exceptional depreciation charge and other write downs of
£31 million. In addition, £84 million of accrued costs relating to disposals in previous years, principally the


-----

disposal of the consumer operations of Cable & Wireless Communications plc on 30 May 2000, have been
released (Discontinued £204 million).

(iv) The profit of £62 million on disposal of fixed assets principally comprises a £54 million gain on the sale of
part of the Group’s interest in MobileOne (Asia) Pte Ltd (Joint ventures and associates £54 million, Other
£8 million).

(v) The current asset investments principally relating to Pacific Century CyberWorks Ltd (PCCW) have been
written down by £274 million to market value at 31 March 2003. The shares held by the Employee Share
Ownership Plan Trust (ESOP) have been written down by £116 million to market value at 31 March 2003.
(Cable & Wireless Global £7 million, Other £383 million).

Year ended 31 March 2002

(vi) Exceptional items included in other operating costs related principally to provisions in respect of ongoing
obligations associated with businesses withdrawn from and redundant assets (Cable & Wireless Global
£112 million, Discontinued operations £6 million), costs associated with the integration of the Web hosting
businesses (Cable & Wireless Global £44 million) and redundancy and reorganisation costs incurred
(Cable & Wireless Global £48 million).

(vii) The Group carried out a review as at 31 March 2002 to determine whether there had been an impairment of
its fixed assets and goodwill. The carrying values of fixed assets and goodwill of each of the Group’s income
generating units were compared to their recoverable amounts, represented by their value in use to the Group.
In accordance with FRS11, the value in use of each of the Group’s income generating units was determined
with reference to the Group’s five year plan, which had been approved by the Board, using a growth rate of
2.5 per cent. in the period beyond the Group’s five year plan (based on a nominal increase in GDP for the
countries in which the Group operates), and an average discount rate of 11 per cent. The resulting charge in
Cable & Wireless Global is £2,007 million in respect of goodwill and £1,502 million in respect of fixed
assets, and in Cable & Wireless Regional £191 million in respect of fixed assets and £87 million in respect of
fixed assets in discontinued operations. In addition, £129 million of fixed assets relating to Cable & Wireless
Global businesses withdrawn from service were written off at 30 September 2001.

(viii) The Group disposed of its interest in Cable & Wireless Optus Limited to Singapore Telecommunications
Limited (SingTel) on 6 September 2001 resulting in a gain of £1,057 million. The consideration received
included shares and bonds issued by SingTel which were converted into cash.

(ix) Current asset investments held in ntl Incorporated (ntl) and CMGI Inc. were written down to nil value and
the investment in PCCW was written down to estimated realisable value (Other £904 million).

Year ended 31 March 2001

(x) Implementation of the Group’s strategy based on IP affected the useful life and carrying value of certain
network assets employed in its switched circuit voice business. An assessment of the value in use of this
business based on a discount rate of 9.5 per cent., resulted in an impairment charge to these assets of £444
million (Cable & Wireless Global £353 million, Discontinued operations £91 million).

(xi) The Group disposed of its interests in Cable & Wireless HKT Limited and ConsumerCo to PCCW and ntl
for a gain of £3,594 million and £586 million respectively. The consideration received in respect of both
transactions included cash and shares in the acquirer which under the terms of the sale and purchase
agreements, the Group was required to retain for various periods. These are disclosed as part of discontinued
operations. The gain primarily includes the subsequent partial sales of the PCCW (profit of £600 million)
and ntl (loss of £25 million) shares, less the reduction in market value of the retained shares below their book
values (£449 million).

(xii) The Group effected the transformation of its activities from an integrated model offering a total range of
services to consumer and business customers structured on geographic lines to one focussing on the
provision of global IP solutions to business customers. The costs directly associated with this reorganisation
and restructuring amounted to £530 million (Cable & Wireless Global £451 million, Cable & Wireless
Regional £66 million, other £13 million) and included announced redundancies, retraining, recruitment and
relocation (£265 million) and property, product and systems rationalisation (£208 million).

(xiii) Related to the sale of mobile telephone transmission towers in Australia and properties in the
United Kingdom and is included as part of discontinued operations.

(i) Taxation, including deferred taxation

The movement in the Group deferred tax balance from £105 million to £67 million (Company – £6 million
to £1 million) during the year comprises £31 million credited in the profit and loss account (Company: £5
million) and £7 million relating to exchange and other movements (Company – £nil). The total deferred tax
balance relates to excess capital allowances. The movement in the Group’s other tax provisions from £388
million to £nil (Company – £197 million to £nil) comprises utilisation of £380 million in respect of the tax
settlement (Company – £197 million) and £8 million (Company – £nil) relating to exchange and other
movements.

The deferred tax liability does not include an amount of £24 million (2002 – £58 million) of contingent tax
liability arising on the reserves of overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates which the Group does not
expect to remit to the United Kingdom.

As at 31 March 2003, the Group had tax losses to carry forward of approximately £6,860 million
(2002 – £2,588 million) against which no deferred tax asset has been recognised. A deferred tax asset is regarded
as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as
more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying
timing differences can be deducted.

(ii) Pensions

The Group operates various unfunded pension plans. Provision is made for the expected cost of meeting the
associated liabilities. In view of their long term nature, the timing of utilisation of these provisions is uncertain.
Included within this provision is an amount of £4.7 million (2002 – £6.4 million) to cover the cost of former
Directors’ pension entitlements.

(iii) Redundancy

Provision has been made for the cost of redundancies announced during the year which are expected to be
utilised within 12 months.

(iv) Property

Provision has been made for the best estimate of the unavoidable lease payments on vacant properties, being
the difference between the rentals due and any income expected to be derived from their being sub-let. The
provision is expected to be utilised over the shorter of the period to exit and the lease contract life. Provision has
also been made for the difference between rentals on properties relating to businesses acquired during the
previous financial year and their fair value at the date of acquisition. The provision is being utilised over the lease
contract life.


-----

(v) Network

Provision has been made for the best estimate of the unavoidable costs associated with redundant network
capacity. The provision is expected to be utilised over the shorter of the period to exit and the lease contract life.

(vi) Other

Other provisions include £13 million relating to the disposal of the US discontinued businesses. It is
expected that this provision will be utilised within 12 months. Other provisions also include £9 million relating to
specific claims held against the Group’s insurance subsidiary.

The Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust

The Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust (the Trust) is a discretionary trust which has been funded by
loans from the Company to acquire shares in Cable and Wireless plc. The Trust held 54,738,313 shares (2002 –
38,862,510 shares) valued at £38 million (2002 – £87 million) on 31 March 2003. The cost of running the Trust is
included in the profit and loss account. The Trustees of the plan may notionally allocate Ordinary Shares in the
Company annually to Executive Directors or other senior executives and other key staff. Shares are held in trust
until such time as they may be transferred to employees in accordance with the terms of the Performance Share


-----

Plan, the Restricted Share Plan, the Deferred Short Term Incentive Plan, details of which are given in the
Directors’ Remuneration Report, and the Share Option Plan, details of which are given below. The shares will be
provided from existing Ordinary Shares in issue acquired by the Trustees. The expected cost of all these shares is
charged to the profit and loss account over the life of the relevant scheme. Surplus shares may be held to satisfy
future awards. The Trust has waived its rights to dividends. At 31 March 2003, there were 26,754 shares under
options in relation to the Long Term Incentive Plan, 8,710,393 shares under contingent awards in relation to the
Performance Share Plan, 763,283 shares under restricted share awards in relation to the Restricted Share Plan,
44,109 shares under the Deferred Short Term Incentive Plan and 76,210,041 shares under options in relation to
the Share Option Plan.

Cable & Wireless Savings Related Share Option Scheme and Cable & Wireless Global Savings Related
Share Option Scheme

Under the Cable & Wireless Savings Related Share Option Scheme (SAYE scheme), UK employees can
enter a savings contract with a bank to save regular monthly sums of between £5 and £250 for a period of either
three or five years. At the end of the savings contract, the participant receives interest from the bank on their
savings. The savings and the interest may then be used to exercise an option over Ordinary Shares of the
Company which are issued at a discount of 20 per cent. to the market value of the Company’s Ordinary Shares at
the date of grant. The Company has extended the SAYE scheme to its overseas employees by the Cable &
Wireless Global Savings Related Share Option Scheme (GSAYE scheme). The GSAYE scheme is offered
throughout the Group’s territories (with the exception of the UK and US) and it operates along similar lines to the
SAYE scheme with local variances to accommodate local legal and tax considerations.

The Group has taken advantage of the exemption contained in UITF Abstract 17 – ‘Employee share
schemes’ not to recognise a charge to the profit and loss account in respect of its Inland Revenue approved SAYE
scheme.

Cable & Wireless Revenue Approved Share Option Scheme

Prior to July 2001, Cable & Wireless granted share options under the Cable & Wireless Revenue Approved
Share Option Scheme (RESOS). Options awarded under this plan between June 1999 and July 2001 are subject to
performance based conditions based on Cable & Wireless’ Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance relative
to the FTSE 100 Index, underpinned by real growth in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation
and turnover. For full vesting, Cable & Wireless’ TSR must achieve at least upper quartile level against the FTSE
100 between the third and fifth anniversaries of the date of grant. Half vesting applies for TSR at the median
level, with a sliding scale between median and upper quartiles. If the performance conditions are not met by the
fifth anniversary of the date of grant, the options lapse. As at the date of this report, no such options have
achieved their performance conditions.

Options granted under RESOS before June 1999 became exercisable if growth in Company’s published
earnings per share (excluding exceptional items) measured over any period of three consecutive financial years,
commencing not earlier than the financial year in which the option was granted, exceeded by not less than
6 per cent. the percentage growth of the Retail Price Index over the same three year period. All such options
became exercisable in full. No further grants will be made under the RESOS plan.

Cable & Wireless Share Option Plan

The Share Option Plan is the principal vehicle for long-term retention and incentivisation for the
Executive Directors, other executives and key staff. The level of any award is determined by the Remuneration
Committee each year by reference to total remuneration within a market peer group, subject to an overriding
annual limit of six times salary for the Chief Executive and four times salary for other Executive Directors.

The vesting of share options awarded to the Executive Directors and to all employees outside the
United States is subject to relative TSR performance conditions. Full vesting occurs only if the TSR performance
of the Company meets or exceeds the upper quartile between the third and fifth anniversaries of the date of grant.
Where TSR performance meets the median, 50 per cent. of the initial award vests. A sliding scale operates
between median and upper quartile, and nothing vests for TSR performance below the median. If performance
conditions have not been met by the fifth anniversary of the date of grant, the options lapse.

Performance conditions are applied in determining the level of awards to employees in the United States, but
do not normally apply to the vesting of such awards. In addition, 25 per cent. of awards to employees in the
United States vest on the first anniversary of the date of the grant with a further 25 per cent. on each subsequent
anniversary. These terms reflect normal practice in the United States.

Cable & Wireless Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)

The Company also offers employees of its US subsidiaries the Cable & Wireless Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (ESPP) which is a section 423 qualified plan under the US Internal Revenue Code 1986. Under the Plan,
employees can save over a one year period sums of between US$10 and US$800 per payroll payment. At the end
of each period the employees have the option to purchase ADRs in the Company at a 15 per cent. discount to the
market price of an ADR at the date of grant. Each ADR represents three Ordinary Shares in the Company.

Cable & Wireless Share Purchase Plan

The Company also offers its employees who are chargeable to income tax, under Section 15 Income Tax
(Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003, the Cable & Wireless Share Purchase Plan (the Plan) which is a Revenue
Approved Share Incentive Plan. Under the Plan, employees can contribute between £5 and £125 per month, or 10
per cent. of pre tax salary each month, whichever is the lower, to buy partnership shares in the Company. Shares
are held in a UK resident trust and can be withdrawn from the trust at any time, but there may be pay as you earn
taxation and national insurance contributions payable in such events if the shares have not been held in the trust
for five years. Dividends on the partnership shares are re-invested in additional Dividend Shares.

The Company profit and loss account includes a net unrealised loss of £11,141 million (2002 –
£3,626 million) in respect of impairments to investments in subsidiary undertakings.

The Company carries investments in subsidiary undertakings at valuation. Provisions for impairment have
been made in respect of some of the Company’s investments in subsidiary undertakings.

The Directors have considered the value of the Company’s other fixed assets and are satisfied that the
aggregate value of those assets which have not actually been revalued was not less than the aggregate amount at
which they are stated in the Company’s accounts. Thus, under section 275(6) of the Companies Act 1985 the
‘relevant items’ (as mentioned in section 270(2) of the Act) are accordingly regarded as stated in the Company’s
accounts on the basis that a revaluation of all of the Company’s fixed assets took place at that time. Consequently,
the provisions for impairment are deemed by section 275 of the Companies Act 1985 to be an unrealised loss.

Exchange adjustments in the Group are net of exchange profits of £20 million (2002 – £27 million, 2001 –
losses of £39 million) on foreign currency borrowings. The cumulative amount of goodwill charged to reserves in
prior years as a result of acquisitions, net of goodwill written back through the profit and loss account and
statement of total recognised gains and losses, amounted to £475 million (2002 – £475 million, 2001 – £885
million). Of this amount £441 million (2002 – £441 million, 2001 – £441 million) related to joint ventures and
associates.

26. Financial instruments

An outline of the objectives, policies and strategies pursued by the Group in relation to financial instruments
is set out under ‘‘Operating and Financial Review – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Treasury policy’’ above.

For the purpose of the disclosures which follow in this note, short term debtors and creditors which arise
directly from the Group’s operations have been excluded from financial assets and liabilities as permitted under
Financial Reporting Standard 13 – ‘Derivatives and other financial instruments: disclosures’ except for currency
risk disclosures. The disclosures therefore focus on those financial instruments which play a significant medium
to long term role in the financial risk profile of the Group. An analysis of the carrying value of all financial assets
and liabilities is given in the fair value table on page F-37.

Interest rate management

The interest rate profile of the financial liabilities of the Group at 31 March 2003, after taking account of
interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps, is set out in the table below:

Floating Fixed Non-interest Floating Fixed Non-interest
Currency rate rate bearing 2003 rate rate bearing 2002

232 865 449 1,546 355 990 914 2,259

The floating rate financial liabilities comprise bank borrowings bearing interest at rates fixed in advance for
periods ranging from one week to six months by reference to LIBOR for sterling and US dollar borrowings.

The non-interest bearing financial liabilities comprise £449 million (2002 – £914 million) of the zero coupon
exchangeable bonds, which are exchangeable into ordinary shares of PCCW. The bonds were issued on
9 April 2001 at 100 per cent. of their US$1,504 million principal amount. During the year the Group purchased
US$600 million (2002 – US$200 million) of the principal amount of the bonds at a discount to their face value.
This resulted in a gain of US$15 million (£10 million), (2002 – US$10 million (£7 million)) which is recognised
in the current year profit and loss account in full. Subject to the conditions of the bonds, the bondholders had the
option to exchange the bonds into ordinary shares of PCCW at any time prior to the close of business on
2 June 2003. The Company had the option to redeem the bonds at their principal amount provided that the market
value of the ordinary shares of PCCW on such dealing day is greater than 120 per cent. of the aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding bonds on each of 15 of any 20 consecutive dealing days. Unless previously purchased
or redeemed (on exchange or otherwise), the bonds will be redeemed at their principal amount on 9 June 2003.

The Group has a net asset of £4 million (2002 – £1 million net liability) resulting from the fair value of
forward exchange contracts entered into before 31 March 2003. This has been excluded from the preceding table.

The weighted average interest rates for the fixed rate financial liabilities of the Group at 31 March 2003,
together with the periods for which the rates were fixed, are set out in the table below:

3,165 358 3,523 4,888 755 5,643

The floating rate financial assets principally comprise cash and short term deposits. Of the total,
approximately 90 per cent. is held by the Group’s central treasury operations as sterling and US dollar cash
deposits with short term maturities based on LIBOR and maturities ranging between one and 12 months.

At 31 March 2003, the Group had no financial assets upon which fixed income was earned during that year.
The non-interest bearing financial assets are held in the form of shares.

During the year the Company purchased £75 million of credit linked notes issued by an AA-rated bank and
referenced to the £200 million bond maturing in 2012. Two notes of £25 million and £50 million were purchased
with maturities of September 2003 and July 2004 respectively. The transactions have a similar economic effect to
repurchasing the referenced bonds for the period of the investment. The notes pay interest at an average rate of
LIBOR plus 151 basis points.

In return for receiving interest on the credit linked notes at rates in excess of LIBOR the final redemption to
be received by the Company is determined by certain circumstances related to the credit risk of the Company.
These circumstances arise if there has been a ‘credit event’ as defined in the terms of the note, in which case the
counterparties may redeem the notes at less than par value. A credit event arises in the event of any of the
following circumstances in respect of Cable and Wireless plc only:

– bankruptcy;

– failure to make any payment due under any of its debt obligations, after expiration of any grace period
and subject to a threshold of £25 million; and

– restructuring of any of its debt subject to a threshold of £25 million.

If a credit event should take place, the credit linked note is unlikely to be redeemed for cash. Instead the
Company is likely to receive its own bonds or debt obligations with a par value equivalent to that of the credit
linked notes in settlement of redemption of the note.

Exchange risk management

The following table shows the Group’s currency exposures at 31 March 2003 on currency transactions that
give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account. Such exposures comprise
the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the functional currency of the
operating company involved, other than certain non-sterling borrowings treated as hedges of net investments in
overseas companies.

Trade investments

Trade investments above are detailed in Note 17 but exclude ESOP shares carried at £38 million (2002 –
£123 million) with a fair value of £38 million (2002 – £87 million). The fair value is based on year end quoted
prices for listed investments and estimates of likely sales proceeds for other investments.

Cash at bank and in hand, short term deposits and short term borrowings

The carrying value approximates to fair value either because of the short maturity of the instruments or
because the interest rate on investments is reset after periods not greater than six months.

Current asset investments

The fair value is based on market value or estimates of likely sales proceeds.

Convertible bonds and other long term debt

The fair value is based on quoted market prices or, where these are not available, on the quoted market
prices of comparable debt issued by other companies.


-----

Forward rate agreements, interest rate and cross currency swaps

The fair value of forward rate agreements, interest rate and cross currency swaps is the estimated amount
which the Group would expect to pay or receive were it to terminate the swaps at the balance sheet date. This
takes into consideration current interest rates, current exchange rates and the current creditworthiness of the
counterparties. The nominal value of swaps at 31 March 2003 was £2,146 million (2002 – £5,206 million).

Forward exchange contracts

The value of these contracts is the estimated amount which the Group would expect to pay or receive on the
termination of the contracts. This takes into consideration current interest rates and current exchange rates. At
31 March 2003 the Group had £406 million of such contracts outstanding (2002 – £107 million).

Hedges

Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged
is itself recognised. Unrecognised gains and losses on instruments used for hedging (excluding hedges that have
been accounted for by adjusting the carrying value of a fixed asset recognised on the balance sheet), and on the
underlying asset or liability, are as follows:

The above net unrecognised loss is a reflection of different market interest rates ruling at 31 March 2003.

27. Commitments and contingent liabilities

Commitments

Capital commitments at the end of the financial year, for which no provision has been made, are as follows:

Group Company

2003 2002 2003 2002

Contracted. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 135 367 — —

The Group figures above exclude amounts payable for certain network assets to be ordered by August 2005
under a take or pay contract. During the year this contract was re-negotiated. The £16 million committed and
payable under the amended contract has been provided for as at 31 March 2003.

In addition to the capital commitments above the Group has a number of operating commitments arising in
the ordinary course of the Group’s business. The most significant of these relate to network operating and
maintenance costs, and out-sourcing arrangements in the UK and US for the provision of certain services
including human resources and information technology systems management. In respect of operating and
maintenance costs, in the event of default of another party, the Group may be liable to additional contributions
under the terms of the agreements.


-----

Contingent liabilities

Contingent liabilities at the end of the financial year for which no provision or disclosure has been made
elsewhere in the financial statements are as follows:

Group Company

2003 2002 2003 2002

£m £m £m £m

181 154 670 701

Upon re-examination of the Group’s trading guarantees the comparative for 2002 has been amended to
£154 million.

Trading guarantees principally comprise performance bonds or contracts issued in the normal course of
business guaranteeing the Group will meet its obligations to complete projects in accordance with the contractual
terms and conditions. The guarantees also enable the customer to obtain repayment of any advance payment in
the event of the relevant subsidiary failing to carry out its contractual obligations in full. Some of these
guarantees are uncapped.

The nature of contracts includes projects, service level agreements, installation of equipment, surveys,
purchase of equipment and transportation of materials. The guarantees contain a clause that they will be
terminated on final acceptance of work to be done under the contract.

Other guarantees include guarantees in respect of the financial obligations of subsidiary undertakings
principally in respect of leases, borrowings and letters of credit.

Pender Insurance Limited (‘Pender’), the Group’s Isle of Man insurance subsidiary, has written policies in
favour of the Group and third parties. Significant insurance claims have been made against Pender under certain
of these third party policies. Pender is currently taking legal advice and it intends to defend vigorously these
claims, and has notified its reinsurers where appropriate. The Board of Pender, in accordance with Financial
Reporting Standard 12 ‘‘Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets’’ determined that no provision
was required in its financial statements for these claims for the year ended 31 March 2003. As certain of the
insurance claims have not yet been fully quantified or substantiated by the claimants, it is not currently
practicable to estimate their financial effects. Since 31 March 2003, Pender has ceased to write third party
insurance.

Other matters

In addition the Company has, as is considered standard practice in such agreements, given guarantees and
indemnities in relation to a number of disposals of subsidiary undertakings in prior years. Generally, liability has
been capped at no more than the value of the sales proceeds, although some uncapped indemnities have been
given.

In relation to the sale of CWC ConsumerCo, the Company gave a number of standard warranties and
indemnities. There is no time limit or cap that applies generally. The Company also gave warranties and
indemnities in relation to facility sharing agreements.

The Directors do not expect any of these guarantees to result in a material loss to the Group or Company.

32. Liquid resources

Liquid resources comprise short term deposits which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash at
or close to their carrying value.

Included within liquid resources are amounts totalling £48 million (2002 – £47 million) held by the Group’s
insurance subsidiary. These assets are actively managed to meet insurance liabilities. These assets are required to
meet insurance solvency requirements and, as a result, are not all readily available for the general purposes of the
Group. Other short term deposits typically include bank deposits, excluding those which are repayable on
demand, commercial paper and government securities. These deposits have short maturities and a high turnover
arising from rollover as part of the Group’s treasury management activities.

33. Related party transactions

34. Legal Proceedings

Class action litigation against Cable and Wireless plc

Between December 2002 and February 2003, ten shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia naming Cable and Wireless plc and several of its
officers and directors as defendants.

In March 2003, the court consolidated all of the cases into one action, styled as In re Cable and Wireless plc
Securities Litigation, Civil Action No. 02-1860-A. The Court has appointed Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan
Board, an institutional investor located in Canada, and Alex Osinski, a U.S. citizen, as co-lead plaintiffs
(collectively ‘lead plaintiffs‘) to prosecute on behalf of all plaintiffs.


-----

In May 2003, the lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint that alleges violations of certain sections of
the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules promulgated thereunder. A central allegation is that the
defendants made false and misleading statements about the Company’s financial condition by failing to disclose
on a timely basis the existence of a tax indemnity and a ratings trigger to place money in escrow until any liability
which the Company may have had under the tax indemnity was finally determined. The indemnity and ratings
trigger appear in an agreement between the Company and Deutsche Telekom for the sale of the Company’s
interest in the mobile telephone company that operated under the name One2One.

In addition to the allegations relating to the tax indemnity, the consolidated complaint also alleges that the
defendants made false and misleading statements by: (1) failing to disclose certain lease liability commitments
and (2) improperly recognising revenue received from sales of capacity to other carriers.

The plaintiffs seek unspecified money damages in their complaints.

Cable & Wireless believes that it has meritorious defences to these claims and intends to vigorously defend
itself in this litigation.

Dispute with IBM UK Limited

Disputes between (1) Cable and Wireless plc and IBM United Kingdom Limited, (2) Cable & Wireless
USA, Inc. and International Business Machines Corporation and (3) IBM Japan Limited and Cable & Wireless
IDC Incorporated (collectively ‘Cable & Wireless’ and ‘IBM’ respectively) have arisen out of a Global
Framework Agreement (GFA) dated 20 December 2000, and related agreements, pursuant to which IBM agreed
to supply to Cable & Wireless information technology services.

In order to monitor the quality of the services provided by IBM, including price and service levels, the GFA
contains ‘benchmarking’ provisions, which set out the processes and procedures by which the services provided
by IBM are to be assessed against a pre-determined objective. In February 2002, the parties engaged Compass
America Inc (Compass) to conduct a benchmark for the 14 month period from 1 January 2001 to 28 February
2002, the results of which revealed significant levels of overcharging by IBM.

Disputes arose as to whether the GFA obliged IBM to repay to Cable & Wireless the amounts that the
benchmark established it has been overcharged and as to whether the Compass reports were valid both in terms of
their substance and conformity with the GFA benchmarking requirements. On 4 July 2002, the Company issued
proceedings for a declaration that it is entitled to compensation from IBM UK for any period of overcharging,
including past overcharging, and to compensation in respect of overcharging as identified by Compass.

After an inconclusive Court-ordered mediation that took place in December 2002, the Court ordered an
expedited trial of all matters in issue between the parties. Full pleadings were then exchanged. Cable & Wireless
seeks a declaration as to the meaning of certain overcharging related provisions of the GFA and compensation for
overcharging by IBM. From January 2001 to the date Cable & Wireless’ proceedings were issued, its claim in
respect of overcharging by IBM amounts to approximately £115 million in respect of the United Kingdom and
approximately US$22 million in respect of the United States. For each month that IBM refuses to reduce its
charges a further substantial overcharge arises. IBM UK and IBM US seek the declaration in respect of the
Compass reports referred to above and IBM UK has brought counterclaims in respect of work it alleges Cable &
Wireless should have given to it under the GFA and claims damages to be assessed. IBM Japan Limited seeks
payment of certain charges allegedly due and payable to it by Cable & Wireless IDC Inc. Subsequently, on 21
February 2003, the Court directed that Cable & Wireless’ claim as to the meaning of certain overcharging related
provisions of the GFA should be heard separately from the other claims and counterclaims as a preliminary issue.
The preliminary issue has been set for trial in September 2003.

Cable & Wireless believes that it has meritorious defences to the counter claims asserted by IBM and
intends to vigorously defend itself in this litigation.

Claim by APCC Services, Inc. and others

On 30 March 2001, a complaint was filed in the US District Court for the District of Columbia against
Cable & Wireless USA, Inc. and was served on Cable & Wireless USA, Inc. on 25 June 2001. The complaint was
filed by a group of billing and collection agents on behalf of hundreds of entities that own and operate public
payphones throughout the United States. The complaint alleges that Cable & Wireless USA, Inc. violated the
US Communications Act and the rules, regulations, and orders of the Federal Communications Commission by
not adequately compensating the independent payphone operators for toll free and access code calls that were
made from the independent payphone operators’ payphones and carried over Cable & Wireless USA, Inc.’s
network.


-----

The complaint seeks approximately US$5 million in monetary damages. In August 2001, Cable & Wireless
USA, Inc. and the plaintiff entered into a tolling agreement whereby the obligations of the parties in litigation
would be suspended until 1 November 2001, while the parties attempted to resolve the dispute informally.
Plaintiffs refiled their complaint which is now pending in the US District Court for the District of Columbia. The
parties agreed to a confidential, non-binding, third-party neutral evaluation for settlement purposes which is
currently ongoing.

Cable & Wireless USA, Inc. believes that it has meritorious defences to the claims. If the dispute is not
resolved through the neutral evaluation process, Cable & Wireless USA, Inc. intends to vigorously defend the
action.

Litigation against Digital Island, Inc./Cable & Wireless Internet Services, Inc.

As described in ‘Description of Cable & Wireless – History’, in 2002 Cable & Wireless acquired 100 per
cent of Digital Island, which is now known as Cable & Wireless Internet Services, Inc.

Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) filed a patent
infringement suit against Digital Island on 13 September 2000 in the US District Court for the District of
Massachusetts, alleging that a version of Digital Island’s content delivery service infringes a patent owned by
MIT and licensed exclusively to Akamai. On 20 September 2000, Akamai and MIT filed a further claim alleging
infringement by Digital Island of a second Akamai patent.

On 21 December 2001, a jury invalidated three of the claims related to one of the Akamai patents. The jury
also found that Digital Island infringed one independent claim and three dependent claims of this patent. Digital
Island was found not to have infringed the other patent. On 23 August 2002, the Court entered a permanent
injunction prohibiting further infringement of certain of the surviving claims. Cable & Wireless has revised its
content delivery service (at little cost to and with no other effect on its customers) in such a way that Cable &
Wireless believes that the infringement no longer exists and that the injunction is of no effect. Nevertheless, on
17 September 2002, Akamai filed a contempt motion with the Court asserting that Cable & Wireless Internet
Services, Inc. is violating the injunction by continuing to infringe the surviving Akamai claims. The Court denied
Akamai’s motion on 1 November 2002. A damages trial has not yet been scheduled on the infringed claims.

On 22 January 2003, Akamai filed a patent infringement suit against Cable & Wireless Internet Services,
Inc. in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, alleging that the Cable & Wireless content
delivery service infringes a recently-issued patent owned by Akamai. Upon motion by Cable & Wireless Internet
Services, Inc. the case was transferred to the District Court for the District of Massachusetts.

On 22 April 2003, Akamai filed a patent infringement suit against Cable & Wireless Internet Services, Inc.
in the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that the Cable & Wireless content delivery
service infringes a patent issued to Akamai that same day. Akamai has not yet effected service of the complaint in
this case.

On 29 August 2002, Teknowledge Corporation (Teknowledge) filed a patent infringement suit against Cable
& Wireless Internet Services, Inc., Akamai, and Inktomi Corporation in the US District Court for the District of
Delaware, alleging that the content delivery service of each defendant infringes a patent owned by Teknowledge.
Upon motion by Cable & Wireless Internet Services, Inc. the case was transferred to the District Court for the
Northern District of California.

Cable & Wireless Internet Services, Inc. believes that it has meritorious defences to the outstanding claims
asserted in these cases and intends to vigorously defend itself in these cases.

Class actions against Digital Island, Inc. in connection with its initial public offering

In August 2001, Digital Island became aware that two purported shareholder class action lawsuits were filed
in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York naming Digital Island as a defendant along with
certain of its present and former officers and directors and alleging violations of certain sections of the Securities
Act 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act 1934.

The actions (which now include a third suit making virtually identical claims and allegations) allege that the
Registration Statement and Prospectus through which Digital Island conducted its initial public offering (IPO) in
June 1999 was false and misleading because it failed to disclose, amongst other things, that:

(i) the underwriters of the IPO allegedly had solicited and received excessive and undisclosed
commissions from certain investors in exchange for which the underwriters allocated to those


-----

investors material portions of the restricted number of Digital Island shares issued in connection with
the IPO; and

(ii) the underwriters allegedly had entered into agreements with customers whereby the underwriters
agreed to allocate Digital Island shares to those customers in the IPO in exchange for which the
customers agreed to purchase additional Digital Island shares in the after market at pre-determined
prices.

On 15 July 2002, Cable & Wireless moved to dismiss all claims against it. On 19 February 2003, the Court
denied the motion to dismiss.

Cable & Wireless Internet Services, Inc. is now engaged in settlement discussions with the plaintiffs.
Notwithstanding this, Cable & Wireless Internet Services, Inc. believes that it has meritorious defences to these
claims and, should the settlement discussions prove unsuccessful, intends to vigorously defend itself in any such
litigation.

Class action securities litigation against Digital Island, Inc., Cable & Wireless and others

Digital Island, Cable and Wireless plc, Dali Acquisition Corp. (Dali) (a former subsidiary of Cable &
Wireless), and certain of the then present and former directors of Digital Island, have been named as defendants
in six separate putative class action lawsuits alleging various claims arising out of Cable & Wireless’ acquisition
of Digital Island in August 2001. Three of the lawsuits were filed in the US District Court for the District of
Delaware and three were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The three federal lawsuits were consolidated
into a single case, and, while the plaintiffs’ motion to consolidate the three state cases was granted on 24 April
2002, the plaintiffs have yet to file a consolidated, amended complaint.

The federal suit alleged that the defendants violated federal securities laws by failing to disclose on a timely
basis that Digital Island had entered into certain business agreements with Bloomberg, L.P., and Major League
Baseball. It further alleged that compensation agreements with certain officers and/or directors of the company
violated the federal securities ‘all-holders’ rule. One state lawsuit alleged violations of Delaware law based upon
similar allegations.

The other two state lawsuits alleged various violations of Delaware law against the same corporate
defendants and the present and former Digital Island directors, including that they failed to disclose all material
facts relating to Digital Island’s relationship with Microsoft, and that they failed to obtain a fair price for Digital
Island shares.

On 10 September 2002, a federal judge granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss the federal lawsuits with
prejudice. Plaintiffs have appealed the decision to the US Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Cable &
Wireless believes that it and its subsidiaries have meritorious defences to the claims asserted in these lawsuits,
and intends to continue to vigorously defend itself in that litigation as well should the plaintiffs pursue those
claims.

Litigation with Cibertec International, S.A. and Inversiones Kamasu, S.A.

Cibertec International, S.A. and Inversiones Kamasu, S.A. initiated proceedings against Cable & Wireless
Panama, S.A. and Cable and Wireless (CALA Management Services) Limited in Panama on 29 October 1999.
The claim is for approximately US$125 million and alleges breach of contract. On 18 November 2002, the
Panamanian Circuit Court handed down a decision against Cable & Wireless Panama, S.A. awarding damages of
US$67,255,000, including moral damages and costs. The Court decided that Cable & Wireless Panama, S.A. had
failed to maintain in sufficient confidence certain of the proprietary information of the plaintiffs.

Cable & Wireless Panama, S.A. appealed the judgement on 3 December 2002 and intends to pursue this
appeal vigorously. Pending the resolution of its appeal, Cable & Wireless Panama, S.A. is not obliged to pay, and
has not paid, any of the awards against it.

Claim against the Minister of Finance and Economy

On 16 December 2002, a complaint was filed at the Supreme Court of Justice of Panama against the Minister
of Finance and Economy in Panama alleging that the Operating Agreement executed between Cable and Wireless
(CALA Management Services) Limited and INTEL, S.A. (now Cable & Wireless Panama, S.A.) as part of the
privatisation agreements was null and void ab initio, on the grounds that it had not been published in the Official
Gazette in Panama.

On 21 March 2003, the Court admitted the claim against the Minister of Finance and Economy.


-----

Panamanian counsel consider this claim to be without merit and none of Cable and Wireless plc, Cable &
Wireless Panama, S.A. or Cable and Wireless (CALA Management Services) Limited are parties to the
complaint. However, if the complaint were to be successful and the Operating Agreement declared null and void,
then the complainants could file a complaint against Cable and Wireless (CALA Management Services) Limited
requiring the return of all management fees collected under the agreement since its execution. This would amount
to approximately £60 million. In the event that this complaint is successful, Cable & Wireless and its subsidiaries
intend to vigorously pursue any legal recourse available to them.

Claim by Caribtel (Caribbean) Limited

On 9 May 2003, Caribtel (Caribbean) Limited, a telecommunications operator specialising in calling cards,
filed a suit against Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited in the Supreme Court of Judicature of Jamaica. Caribtel has
alleged that Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited wrongfully disconnected Caribtel’s local access telephone
services, resulting in a breach of contract and a violation of the Jamaican Fair Competition Act and the
Telecommunications Act. Caribtel is claiming US$50 million of lost income to its pre-paid local access calling
card business for the period from 25 April 2003 to 25 April 2006. Caribtel has also claimed aggravated and/or
exemplary damages of Jamaica $300 million (approximately £2.94 million) and is seeking injunctive relief to
have Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited reinstate Caribtel’s local access telephone service.

On 22 May 2003, Caribtel presented a petition for injunctive relief before the Supreme Court of Jamaica
requesting that Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited be required to reinstate Caribtel’s local access telephone
service; be restrained from disconnecting any other telecommunications facility currently supplied to Caribtel’s
business premises until trial; and be prevented from calling on a prior bank guarantee that Caribtel had provided
to Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited in conjunction with a settlement agreement entered into between the parties
in February 2003 relating to breaches of contract by Caribtel in December 2002. The injunctions were not granted
by the court. However, Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited gave an undertaking that it would not disconnect the
direct internet access facility pending a hearing scheduled for 2 June 2003.

Prior to the hearing of 2 June 2003, Caribtel approached Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited with a view to
arriving at a settlement. The parties entered into negotiations as a result of which the matter was taken off the
court list by consent of both parties. A new court date will be set if the parties are unable to arrive at a settlement.
Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited believes that its actions were lawful and that it was entitled to disconnect
Caribtel’s services under its contract with Caribtel. If the settlement negotiations prove unsuccessful, Cable &
Wireless Jamaica Limited will continue to defend itself vigorously in this matter.

Arbitration between Tilts Communications A/S/Cable and Wireless plc/Sonera OY and Republic of
Latvia/Lattelekom SIA

In September 2001, Cable and Wireless plc was joined as a party to an arbitration in connection with its
former participation with Sonera OY (Sonera) in the joint venture Tilts Communications A/S (Tilts). Through
Tilts, Cable and Wireless plc and Sonera purchased a 49 per cent shareholding in a Latvian telecommunications
company, Lattelekom SIA (Lattelekom) in 1994. Cable and Wireless plc sold its interest in Tilts to Sonera in
June 1998.

Tilts commenced arbitration proceedings in August 2000 against the Republic of Latvia alleging a number
of breaches of an agreement signed in 1994 by Tilts, Lattelekom and the Republic of Latvia (the ‘Umbrella
Agreement’). Tilts claims a total of approximately LVL87.6 million (approximately £95 million) from the
Republic of Latvia as compensation for, amongst other things, losses sustained as a consequence of the
shortening of the twenty year exclusivity period granted to Lattelekom as the provider of fixed line
telecommunications services.

The Republic of Latvia has asserted nine counterclaims for a total of approximately LVL599.5 million
(approximately £656 million) against Tilts, alleging that Tilts has failed to comply with various obligations it
assumed under the Umbrella Agreement including (i) to digitalise and otherwise improve Lattelekom’s network
in accordance with its contractual commitments, (ii) to meet certain quality of service and network performance
commitments, and (iii) to procure that Sonera sell its shares in GSM operator Latvijas Mobilais Telefons to
Lattelekom. Tilts considers that the counterclaims asserted by the Republic of Latvia are unfounded.

Cable and Wireless plc was joined as a party to the arbitration by the Republic of Latvia because it
(and Sonera) guaranteed the performance by Tilts of its obligations under the Umbrella Agreement to the
Republic of Latvia by performance and parental guarantees. However, as part of the arrangements relating to
Sonera’s purchase of Cable and Wireless plc’s shares in Tilts, Sonera provided Cable and Wireless plc with an
indemnity for any liability incurred by Cable and Wireless plc under these guarantees. Provided Sonera honours


-----

its obligations under the indemnity, Cable and Wireless plc will not be exposed to any liability under these
guarantees. Cable and Wireless plc has taken legal advice. Based on this advice, Cable and Wireless plc believes
that the indemnity is binding. In addition, Sonera provided Cable and Wireless plc with a letter dated
11 December 2001, confirming that in its view all liabilities, costs and expenses incurred by Cable and Wireless
plc in connection with the arbitration fell within the scope of the indemnity. Following the acquisition of Sonera
in 2002, the successor entity to Sonera, TeliaSonera, provided Cable and Wireless plc with a further letter dated
23 February 2003, acknowledging Sonera’s obligations under the indemnity and stating that TeliaSonera’s
acquisition of Sonera did not alter the validity of the confirmations given by Sonera in its earlier letter of
11 December 2001.

Other than the above, there are no pending legal or regulatory proceedings against the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, which the Company believes will if determined adversely to the Group have a material adverse
effect on the Group’s liquidity or results of operation.
