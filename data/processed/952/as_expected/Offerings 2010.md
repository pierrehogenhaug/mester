**NOTICE TO CERTAIN EUROPEAN INVESTORS**

**_European Economic Area This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that all offers of the Notes_**
will be made pursuant to an exemption under Article 3 of Directive 2003/71/EC (the Prospectus Directive), as
implemented in member states of the European Economic Area (the EEA), from the requirement to produce a
prospectus for offers of the Notes. Accordingly, any person making or intending to make any offer within the
EEA of the Notes should only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Issuer or any of the
Initial Purchasers to produce a prospectus for such offer. Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers have
authorised, nor do they authorise, the making of any offer of Notes through any financial intermediary, other than
offers made by the Initial Purchasers, which constitute the final placement of the Notes contemplated in this
offering memorandum.

In relation to each member state of the European Economic Area that has implemented the Prospectus Directive
(each, a Relevant Member State), with effect from and including the date on which the Prospectus Directive is
implemented in that Relevant Member State (the Relevant Implementation Date), the offer is not being made
and will not be made to the public of any Notes which are the subject of the offering contemplated by this
offering memorandum in that Relevant Member State, other than: (a) to legal entities which are authorised or
regulated to operate in the financial markets or, if not so authorised or regulated, whose corporate purpose is
solely to invest in securities; (b) to any legal entity which has two or more of (i) an average of at least 250
employees during the last financial year; (ii) a total balance sheet of more than €43,000,000; and (iii) an annual
net turnover of more than €50,000,000, as shown in its last annual or consolidated accounts; or (c) in any other
circumstances falling within Article 3(2) of the Prospectus Directive; provided that no such offer of the Notes
shall require the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus
Directive. For the purposes of this provision, the expression an “offer of Notes to the public” in relation to the
Notes in any Relevant Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient
information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase
or subscribe the Notes, as the same may be varied in that Relevant Member State by any measure implementing
the Prospectus Directive in that Relevant Member State and the expression “Prospectus Directive” means
Directive 2003/71/EC and includes any relevant implementing measure in each Relevant Member State.

**_United Kingdom This offering memorandum is for distribution only to, and is only directed at, persons who_**
(i) have professional experience in matters relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial

and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment
activity to which this document relates is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with
relevant persons. The Notes are being offered solely to “qualified investors” as defined in the Prospectus

meaning of the Prospectus Directive.

France within the meaning of Article L.411-1 of the Code monétaire et financier, and has therefore not been

**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This offering memorandum contains “forward-looking statements,” as that term is defined by the US federal
securities laws, relating to the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business, financial condition and
results of operations. You can find many of these statements by looking for words such as “aim,” “anticipate,”
“believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “projected,” “should,”
“will,” “would” and similar words used in this offering memorandum.

By their nature, forward-looking statements are subject to numerous known and unknown assumptions, risks and
uncertainties. Accordingly, actual results, performance, achievements or industry results may differ materially
from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. The Issuer cautions readers not to place
undue reliance on the statements, which speak only as of the date of this offering memorandum. Such forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance.

The cautionary statements set forth above should be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral
forward-looking statements that the Issuer or persons acting on its behalf may issue. Any forward-looking
statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and Cable & Wireless Communications Group
undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the
date of this offering memorandum. New factors will emerge in the future, and it is not possible for us to predict
which factors they will be. In addition, Cable & Wireless Communications Group cannot assess the impact of
each factor on Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business or the extent to which any factor, or
combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those described in any forward-looking
statements.

Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in
the forward-looking statements included in this offering memorandum include, but are not limited to:

    - underperformance of the local and national economies in which the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group operates, including prolonged recession, falling gross domestic product, and increased
unemployment;

    - the negative impact of competitors who may benefit from greater economies of scale driving prices
down and the entrance of new competitors into the market, or failure on the part of Cable & Wireless
Communications Group to effectively compete by identifying new sources of revenue and adjusting
quickly to both technological change and shifts in consumer demand;

    - difficulties implementing Cable & Wireless Communications Group transformation initiatives,
including centralising the management and standardising the branding of subsidiaries and developing
common sets of products in the Caribbean, and difficulties implementing strategies post-Demerger,
including the successful operation of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group as a standalone
entity and the sharing of the “Cable & Wireless” brand by both the Cable & Wireless Communications
and Cable & Wireless Worldwide Groups;

    - interruption or failure of information technology systems upon which the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s operations are reliant, including interruption or failure resulting from
security breaches, terrorist action, human error, natural disasters, failure by third parties to provide
necessary support and network access and other factors beyond the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group’s direct control;

    - adverse effects from complaints, litigation and adverse publicity, including industrial action by labour
unions and litigation threatened or initiated by customers, competitors or regulatory authorities;

    - unforeseen difficulty meeting the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s financial obligations, as
a result of exposure to market and other risks, including difficulty servicing outstanding debt and debt
acquired after the Demerger, and difficulty funding the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s
pension scheme; and

    - changes in the global, political, economic, business, competitive, market and regulatory forces, future
exchange and interest rates, changes in tax rates and future business combinations or disposals.

The Issuer and the Guarantors disclose important factors that could cause the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group’s or the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s actual results to differ materially from expectations under
“Risk Factors,” “Cable & Wireless Communications Group Operating and Financial Review,” “Annex A—Cable
_& Wireless Worldwide Group Operating and Financial Review” and elsewhere in this offering memorandum._

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

Statements regarding market leadership are based on the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s internal
analysis and by reference to one or a combination of sources set forth in “Definitions—market leader”. The
Issuer believes these sources are reliable but cannot assure you that the information is accurate or correctly
reflects its position in its industry or its markets.

**PRESENTATION OF INFORMATION**

This offering memorandum refers to the Cable & Wireless Group, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group
and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group.

References to the Issuer mean Sable International Finance Limited.

References to the Cable & Wireless Group mean Cable and Wireless plc and its subsidiaries and subsidiary
undertakings and, where the context requires, its associated undertakings, which includes, prior to the Demerger
Effective Time, both the Cable & Wireless Communications Group and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group.
The Demerger means the proposed demerger of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group from the Cable &
Wireless Group which was announced on 5 November 2009. The Demerger Effective Time means the date and
time at which the Demerger becomes effective, expected to be at or around 8.00 a.m. (London time) on 26 March
2010.

References to the Cable & Wireless Communications Group or the Group mean, prior to the Scheme
Effective Time, the international operating units of the Cable & Wireless Group that provide mobile, broadband
and domestic and international fixed line services to homes, small and medium enterprises, corporate customers
and governments through its four regional operations in Panama, Macau, the Caribbean and Monaco & Islands
and mean, following the Scheme Effective Time, the subsidiaries and subsidiary undertakings held by Cable &
Wireless Communications. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group was formerly known as Cable &
Wireless International. The Scheme Effective Time means the date and time on which the Scheme becomes
effective in accordance with its terms, which is expected to be at or around 5.00 p.m. (London time) on 19 March
2010. The Scheme means the scheme of arrangement proposed to be made under Part 26 of the Companies Act
2006 between Cable and Wireless plc and the holders of Scheme Shares as set out in the Cable and Wireless plc
Circular, with or subject to any modification, addition or condition approved or imposed by the Court and agreed
to by Cable and Wireless plc and Cable & Wireless Communications.

References to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group mean, prior to the Demerger Effective Time, the
international operating units of the Cable & Wireless Group that provide managed services such as data, hosting
and voice across the UK, Continental Europe, Asia and the US to the world’s largest users of telecommunications
and mean, following the Demerger Effective Time, the subsidiaries and subsidiary undertakings held by Cable &
Wireless Worldwide plc. Information related to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group is presented in “Annex
_A—Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group Information”._

The proposed Demerger involves a number of steps, each of which must be approved or sanctioned if the process
is to result in the successful demerger of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group from the existing Cable &
Wireless Group: (i) the insertion of Cable & Wireless Communications Plc as the new holding company for the

6


-----

Cable & Wireless Group through a court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement; (ii) the Cable & Wireless
Communications reduction of capital to facilitate the Demerger and provide potentially distributable reserves for
the Cable & Wireless Communications Group (the Cable & Wireless Communications Reduction of Capital);
(iii) the Demerger and issue of Cable & Wireless Worldwide ordinary shares; and (iv) the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide reduction of capital to provide potentially distributable reserves for the Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group (the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Reduction of Capital). The Demerger will create two new holding
companies, Cable & Wireless Worldwide plc, which will be the new holding company of the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group, and Cable & Wireless Communications Plc, which initially will be the new holding company
of the current Cable & Wireless Group (including, prior to the effective time of the Demerger, the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group) and will remain the holding company for the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group following the Demerger. The Demerger Proposals are, collectively, the Scheme, the Cable & Wireless
Communications Reduction of Capital, the Demerger and the subsequent Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Reduction of Capital.

The Demerger is the culmination of work which began in April 2006, when the Cable & Wireless Group created
two largely distinct operating units under the Cable and Wireless plc umbrella to reflect the differing
characteristics of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group and
to establish clear strategies for both. Significant progress has been made since then, including the institution of
separate stand alone capital structures, and the Cable and Wireless plc Board considers that the two businesses
have now put in place the necessary arrangements to operate as independent, publicly-quoted businesses.

Although it is expected that the Scheme and the Demerger will become effective before the end of March 2010,
disclosure about the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group is included in this offering memorandum because the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group is currently part of the Cable & Wireless Group and will remain owned by
Cable & Wireless Communications Plc until the Demerger becomes effective. If the Demerger does not become
effective by the Demerger Long Stop Date, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group will remain owned by Cable
& Wireless Communications Plc indefinitely.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group subsidiaries will not guarantee the Notes and will be “Unrestricted
Subsidiaries” as defined in the section “Description of Notes” not subject to the restrictions of the indenture
governing the Notes.

**Use of Non-IFRS financial information**

This offering memorandum contains certain measures that the Issuer believes will assist understanding of the
performance of the business. This approach is largely comparable with that used by Cable and Wireless plc, but
as the measures are not defined under IFRS they may not be directly comparable with other companies’ adjusted
measures. The non-IFRS measures are not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, any IFRS measures of
performance but management have included them as these are considered to be important comparables and key
measures used within the business for assessing performance and supporting the performance measures derived
in accordance with IFRS.

The following are the key non-IFRS measures identified by the Cable & Wireless Communications Group:

    - **EBITDA: Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, LTIP charge, net other operating**
income/expenses and exceptional items.

    - **EBITDA margin percentage: EBITDA divided by revenue.**

    - **Exceptional items: Material items which derive from individual events that fall within the ordinary**
activities of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group that are identified as exceptional items by
virtue of their size, nature or incidence.

    - **Operating Cash Flow: EBITDA less balance sheet capital expenditure and cashflow associated with**
exceptional items.

    - **Gross margin: Revenue less cost of sales.**

    - **Gross margin percentage: Gross margin divided by revenue.**

    - **Operating cost margin: Operating cost divided by revenue.**

    - **Trading Cash Flow: Net cash flow before financing, acquisitions and disposals and top-up**
contributions to the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund.

    - **Active GSM mobile customers or active mobile customers: An active customer is defined as one**
having performed a revenue-generating event in the previous 60 days.

9


-----

    - **Broadband customers: Includes residential and business customers who receive ‘always on’ Internet**
services via cable, traditional fixed line network, wireless network or satellite access.

    - **Fixed line connections: Includes residential and business lines, with each business line counted as one**
connection.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group notes that the above non-IFRS financial measures, in particular,
EBITDA and Operating Cash Flow, have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them
in isolation from, or as a substitute for analysis of, results of operations, as reported under IFRS. Some of these
limitations are:

    - they do not reflect all of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s cash expenditures or future
requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;

    - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group’s working capital needs;

    - they do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or
principal payments, on the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s debt;

    - although depreciation and amortisation are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and
amortised will often have to be replaced in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash
requirements for such replacements;

    - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group’s statements of cash flows; and

    - other companies in the telecommunications industry may calculate these measures differently than the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group does, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure.

As a result of these limitations, EBITDA and Operating Cash Flow should not be considered as a measure of
discretionary cash available to the Cable & Wireless Communications Group to invest in the growth of its
business. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group compensates for these limitations by relying primarily
on its IFRS measures and using EBITDA and Operating Cash Flow measures only supplementally. See the
“Cable & Wireless Communications Group Operating and Financial Review” and the “Cable & Wireless
_Communications Group Selected Historical Financial Information”._

**OVERVIEW**

_The following overview contains basic information about the Cable & Wireless Communications Group and this_
_offering and highlights information appearing elsewhere in this offering memorandum. This overview is not_
_complete and does not contain all of the information that you should consider before investing in the Notes. For_
_a more complete understanding of this offering, the Issuer encourages you to read this entire offering_
_memorandum carefully, including “Risk Factors,” “Cable & Wireless Communications Group Operating and_
_Financial Review,” “Annex A—Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group Information” and the Cable and Wireless_
_Group’s, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s and Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s financial_
_statements and the Notes to those financial statements contained elsewhere in this offering memorandum or_
_incorporated by reference._

**The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group (formerly known as Cable & Wireless International (CWI)),
headquartered in London, England, owns and operates full-service telecommunications businesses providing
mobile, broadband and domestic and international fixed line services to consumers, small and medium-sized
enterprises, corporate customers (including other carriers) and governments. The Cable & Wireless
Communications Group is the market leading telecommunications provider in the majority of its markets around
the world. The business is managed as four regional operations—the Caribbean, Panama, Macau and Monaco &
Islands each of which is profitable and cash generative in its own right. These four regional operations span 38
countries through 33 subsidiaries and five joint ventures, with Panama, Macau, Jamaica, the Maldives and
Monaco being the main markets by revenue. The ownership of these businesses varies—some are wholly owned
and others are partly owned with either public, governmental or corporate partners. The Cable & Wireless
Communications Group generated revenue of US$2,306 million and EBITDA (excluding exceptional items) of
US$854 million in the twelve months ended 30 September 2009.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group has four principal revenue streams, all of which are provided in
the majority of its markets—mobile, broadband, fixed line and enterprise, data and other. The Cable & Wireless
Communications Group derives its mobile revenue from both retail and wholesale streams. Retail revenue is
derived from billing customers for the provision of services, such as direct dial, SMS and mobile Internet;
wholesale revenue is largely made up of interconnect revenue, which arises when customers of other mobile
operators make a call that terminates on, or transfers over, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group
network. Fixed line is a traditional service provided over a legacy network and in recent years it has faced the
challenge of substitution by newer services such as mobile and broadband. Enterprise, data and other revenue
includes revenue from the provision of corporate telecommunications solutions. Generally, broadband services
are billed as packages that offer download and service speed limits for a monthly fee—the higher the download
limits and service speed, the higher the monthly fee. The type and variety of packages offered varies across the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group business and are tailored to the needs of each market.

Each of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s regional operations delivers a broad range of services
across mobile, broadband, fixed line and enterprise, data and other. In the Caribbean, the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group covers 14 countries through 13 subsidiaries and one joint venture, and as of 31 March
2009 had (excluding the Trinidad and Tobago joint venture) 1.3 million active GSM mobile customers, 0.2
million broadband customers and 0.7 million fixed line connections. In Monaco & Islands, the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group covers 22 countries through its subsidiaries and four joint ventures, and in its joint
ventures as of 31 March 2009 had 3.7 million mobile customers, 14,000 broadband customers and 48,000 fixed
line connections. As of 31 March 2009, the subsidiaries of the Monaco & Islands operations had 0.2 million
active GSM mobile customers, 32,000 broadband customers and 0.2 million fixed line connections. In Panama,
as of 31 March 2009, the Group had 2.3 million active GSM mobile customers, 0.1 million broadband customers
and 0.4 million fixed line connections. In Macau, as of 31 March 2009, the Group had 0.4 million active mobile
customers, 0.1 million broadband customers and 0.2 million fixed line connections.

The Group’s earnings are broadly diversified across its four regional operations, with the Caribbean (excluding
the Trinidad and Tobago joint venture), Panama, Macau and Monaco & Islands regional operations contributing
39%, 32%, 16% and 16% of total EBITDA respectively in the year ended 31 March 2009.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group is the only full service telecommunications provider in the
majority of its markets. It is the market leader in 19 out of 27 mobile markets in which it competes, 25 out of


11


-----

34 broadband markets in which it competes and 25 out of 27 fixed line markets in which it competes. As at
30 September 2009, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group, through its subsidiaries and joint ventures,
provided services to approximately 8.3 million mobile, 0.6 million broadband and 1.8 million fixed line
customers.

Following the Demerger, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group will comprise Cable & Wireless
Communications Plc and the entities forming the Cable & Wireless Group other than those entities comprising
the demerged Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group. Principally, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group
will comprise the Cable & Wireless Communications Group businesses and the Central operations of the Cable
& Wireless Group.

**Background to and reasons for the Demerger**

In November 2009, the Cable and Wireless plc Board announced its intention to separate the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group, reflecting its belief that the businesses had
reached a position where they would deliver increased value to shareholders as independently listed companies.
The separation is the culmination of work which began in April 2006, when Cable and Wireless plc created two
distinct operating units under the Cable and Wireless plc umbrella to reflect their differing characteristics and the
establishment of clear strategies for both. As a result of the significant progress made since then, the Cable and
Wireless plc Board considers that the two businesses have now put in place the necessary arrangements to
operate as independent, publicly-quoted businesses.

The Cable and Wireless plc Board believes that the separation will deliver further value for shareholders by:

    - allowing the Cable & Wireless Communications Group and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group to
pursue their strategies independently with greater flexibility over management of resources and
opportunities;

    - creating two separately listed companies with distinct investment profiles and clear market valuations;

    - sharpening management focus further, helping the two businesses maximise their performance; and

    - providing a transparent capital structure and an efficient balance sheet for each business.

There are a number of different steps that will, if approved and sanctioned, culminate in the Demerger of the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group from the existing Cable & Wireless Group. The demerger process will
involve the insertion of a new holding company above Cable and Wireless plc, known as Cable & Wireless
Communications, and the demerger of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group by the new Cable & Wireless
Communications to a second new holding company, Cable & Wireless Worldwide.

**The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business strengths**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group has significant competitive strengths and the Board believes it is
well positioned to deliver strong cash generation and long-term earnings growth to create further shareholder
value. These competitive strengths include:

**_Market leadership_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group is the market leader in the majority of its markets and the primary
challenger in others. It is the market leader in 19 out of 27 markets in mobile, 25 out of 34 markets in broadband
and 25 out of 27 markets in fixed line services. Among its main markets by revenue, Cable & Wireless
Communications Group is the market leader in all services in Panama, Macau, Monaco and the Maldives.

**_Cable & Wireless Communications is an integrated, full service provider_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group provides fixed, broadband and mobile services in the majority of
its markets, and is broadening its proposition into entertainment (such as pay-TV) and enterprise services. In
several markets, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group is the only full service telecommunications
provider including in Panama, Macau, Monaco, the Seychelles, the Maldives and several countries in the
Caribbean. In these markets, its major competitors do not provide all three of mobile, broadband and fixed line
services. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s integrated capability allows it to provide ‘bundled’


12


-----

offers to its customers, under which they are able to buy all telecommunications needs from one provider,
provided it is permitted by law or regulation. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group believes this
‘bundled’ product offering enhances customer retention and serves to limit customer churn.

**_Diversity across geography and product_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group operates in 38 countries, spanning the Caribbean, Central
America, Europe, Africa, Middle East, Asia as well as the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. In financial terms, the
spread of geographies from which it draws revenue reduces Cable & Wireless Communications exposure to any
single country or region. For the six months ended 30 September 2009, the split of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s EBITDA across the four regional operations was as follows: Panama (34%),
Caribbean (33%), Macau (17%) and Monaco & Islands (16%). The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s
revenue is also spread across a range of products and services, reducing its reliance on any single product line.
For the six months ended 30 September 2009, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group reported revenue
was split across its product set as follows: mobile (39%), broadband (9%), domestic voice (21%), international
voice (8%), enterprise, data and other products (23%).

**_Strong cash generation and cash conversion of profit_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group is a highly cash generative group of businesses and has a good track
record of converting its EBITDA to cash flow with US$1.6 billion of cash repatriation since April 2006. A strong
existing asset base and management discipline on capital expenditure underpins the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s focus on cash generation.

**_Brand strength_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group has a recognised and respected brand in “Cable & Wireless”,
which has been used for more than 70 years. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group will be able to
continue to leverage the “Cable & Wireless” brand’s heritage and recognition following the Demerger. In
Panama, the Seychelles, Bermuda and the South Atlantic islands business units, the “Cable & Wireless” brand is
the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s primary product brand, while in the rest of the business, it
remains an important secondary brand, which is known in the market and is used particularly with government,
regulatory and enterprise customers. In the Caribbean, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group uses the
“LIME” brand, in Macau, the “CTM” brand and in Monaco, the “Monaco Telecom” brand, each of which are
recognised as strong brands in their respective markets, associated with the “Cable & Wireless” name.

**_Exposure to markets with enhanced GDP growth_**

Certain markets within the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business have in recent years enjoyed
economic growth above the rates of growth being achieved in more developed markets such as the US and
Europe. Panama and Macau, in particular, have enjoyed enhanced GDP growth in the past few years. In 2009,
Panama achieved an estimated GDP growth rate of 1.8%, in contrast to the economic recessions suffered in many
other countries. In 2008, Panama reported official GDP growth of 9.2%. Macau’s economy has also grown
rapidly in recent years, driven by the construction and operation of large-scale casinos. In 2007 and 2008, its
GDP figures grew by 32.0% and 15.5% respectively. In the early part of 2009, Macau suffered an economic
downturn, in part due to visa restrictions on Chinese mainland tourists travelling to Macau, but its economy
began to recover in the middle of 2009 as restrictions were relaxed. In July to September 2009, Macau reported
GDP growth of 1.2%.

**_Network reach and fixed line infrastructure strength_**

In many of its markets, including Panama, Macau, Monaco and many of its markets in the Caribbean, the Cable
& Wireless Communications Group operates the largest fixed line telecommunications network, providing the


13


-----

most comprehensive coverage. In several markets, including Macau, Monaco and the Maldives, the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group is currently the sole fixed line network operator, providing a significant
strategic advantage, and positioning it as the leading provider of fixed voice and broadband services.

**_Ownership of, and access to, regional cable networks_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group owns solely or in partnership, or has substantial IRU capacity on
a number of regional sub-sea cable systems with land capacity in over 60 countries. This allows the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group to carry large amounts of voice and data traffic on behalf of consumers,
enterprises and carriers and provides inbuilt resilience due to the capability of rerouting traffic.

**_Management experience and diversity_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group has a senior executive team which combines international as well
as local experience. Each business has a local management team which reports into one of the four regional
operations. The senior executive team has more than 125 years of experience in the telecommunications industry
among them.

**_Positive and constructive government relations_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group has long-standing governmental relationships in most of the
countries where it operates. In several countries where the Cable & Wireless Communications Group provides
services, for example, Panama, Macau, Monaco, Grenada, Dominica and the Maldives, the government part-owns
the relevant business and works with the Cable & Wireless Communications Group as a partner. In several markets,
the Cable & Wireless Communications Group is also one of the largest employers and corporate taxpayers.

**Strategy**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s strategy is focused on developing and growing its businesses to
drive strong returns to shareholders. Each regional operation operates as a stand-alone competitive
telecommunications enterprise, and is required to meet annual financial performance targets. Each is profitable
and cash generative in its own right and strives to deliver world class metrics. The Cable & Wireless
Communications Group operation in London brings scale, collaboration, expertise, access to finance and
governance on behalf of shareholders to the entire Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s regional
operations.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s strategic plan focuses on generating growth and value for
shareholders through three elements:

**_Delivering operational excellence_**

Each business operation seeks to drive service excellence and efficiency to maintain a strong competitive
foundation, enabling the businesses to win new customers as well as retain existing customers. Each business
will strive to achieve leading positions in service and network coverage in its markets, increase its efficiency and
streamline its processes.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business operations target operational excellence in customer
services, aiming to provide market leading service against metrics such as response times to repair faults or
responses to customer enquiries. Network coverage is another area in which the strategy of operational
excellence is applied, with new processes and technology being deployed and, where necessary, new capital
expenditure investment to ensure superior coverage for customers on both wireless and fixed networks.

The strategy of operational excellence requires business units to streamline their current cost bases and capital
expenditure, while striving to achieve improved service and coverage. An example of this is the mobile tower
sharing agreement into which the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s subsidiary in Jamaica has entered
with one of its competitors which has increased network coverage and lowered long-term capital expenditure
costs. Other cost reduction activities may include outsourcing and increased collaboration amongst Cable &
Wireless Communications Group companies on procurement activities to maximise synergies.

**_Expanding product offering through new services_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group is focused on capturing new organic growth opportunities from
services which can be offered to its customer base. These services, in most cases, will leverage the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group’s strengths, for example, mobile market leadership, fixed line networks and
strength, ownership of and access to regional cable networks. The introduction of new services aims to drive
revenue and offset any decline in existing services as well as repositioning the business to the changing demands
of the markets in which it operates.

New services include:

— Managed services

A service in which the Cable & Wireless Communications Group takes on the management of a corporate or
government customer’s telecommunication services, as well as providing the telecom service (e.g. voice and
data) itself. The Panama operation has won several managed services contracts with the Panamanian
government including running the telecom platform for the country’s “911” emergency services.

— Cable/Carrier

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group has substantial cable assets in the Caribbean and Central
American regions, which offer new commercial opportunities as the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group’s focus broadens from using these assets for internal purposes only to capitalising on the growing
wholesale market. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s cable assets are strategically placed to
capture the rapidly increasing demand for resilient and large bandwidth data transit between Central and
South America, and the United States.

— Pay-TV

Pay-TV services enable the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business operations to offer
bundled ‘triple-play’ (pay-TV, fixed line and broadband) or ‘quad-play’ (pay-TV, fixed line, broadband and
mobile) services where permitted by law. Pay-TV operators have emerged in several telecommunications
markets as a competitive threat to telecommunications companies, as many have the capability to provide
fixed line and broadband services. In Panama, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group launched a
pay-TV service in December 2009.

— Mobile data

Mobile data services have emerged through the development of higher capacity mobile networks—in
particular 3G networks—and the development of mobile handsets being capable of receiving the Internet
(data) at, relatively, high speeds. In markets in which it operates high capacity networks, the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group is able to offer its customers mobile broadband propositions and valueadded services, such as commercial services available over the Internet and instant messaging services.

**_Developing core regional hubs_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s long-term business development strategy is focused around a
small number of core regional hubs from which it will develop a scalable platform of services, capabilities and
management. This focuses on: Latin America, led by the Panama operation; the Caribbean; Macau; and the
clusters of the Monaco & Islands business. In developing these hubs, the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group is seeking to take advantage of its proximity to markets adjacent to each hub, as well as creating a base for
offering cross-border telecommunication services, such as managed services for multinational customers. The
Cable & Wireless Communications Group will also manage its business around these regional hubs to deliver
value to shareholders. This will include considering the acquisition of licences and the roll out of services into
adjacent territories, acquisitions or disposals or increasing its stake in current investments, for example, the
recent additional investment in the Maldives, when it is possible to enhance value.

(1) EBITDA has been calculated as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, LTIP charge, net
other operating income/expenses and exceptional items. EBITDA is a supplemental measure of Cable &
Wireless Communications Group’s performance that is not required by or presented in accordance with IFRS.
EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to IFRS measures, such as profit before income tax and
profit for the period or any other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS. The Cable &
Wireless Communications Group uses EBITDA to facilitate operating performance comparisons and because
it believes it is frequently used by securities analysts. EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and
prospective purchasers should not consider it in isolation from, or as a substitute analysis for, Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s results of operations. Other companies may define EBITDA differently and, as a
result, Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s measure of EBITDA may not be directly comparable to the
EBITDA of other companies. EBITDA is presented herein including costs attributable to the Central
operations for the relevant period. Historically, Cable and Wireless plc has reported EBITDA for its CWI
business excluding such costs. Accordingly, the financial information and guidance presented in “Cable &
_Wireless Communications Operating and Financial Review—Financial Guidance for 2009/2010” is shown_
excluding costs attributable to the Central operations. Costs of Central operations included in the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group’s EBITDA (excluding exceptional items) presented herein were £22 million

(2) EBITDA margin is calculated as EBITDA (excluding exceptional items) divided by revenue.

(3) Trading cash flow has been calculated as net cash flow before financing, acquisitions and disposals and top-up
contributions to the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund. Trading cash flow is a supplemental measure of
Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s performance and liquidity that is not required by or presented in
accordance with IFRS. Trading cash flow should not be considered as an alternative to IFRS measures. The
Cable & Wireless Communications Group uses trading cash flow to facilitate operating performance
comparisons and because it believes it is frequently used by securities analysts. Trading cash flow has
limitations as an analytical tool, and prospective purchasers should not consider it in isolation from, or as a
substitute analysis for, Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s results of operations. Other companies
may define trading cash flow differently and, as a result, Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s measure
of trading cash flow may not be directly comparable to the trading cash flow of other companies.

_Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group Risk Factors”._

**Risks relating to the telecommunications industry and markets in which the Cable & Wireless**
**Communications Group operates**

**_The Cable & Wireless Communications Group may fail to compete effectively in the competitive markets in_**
**_which it operates_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group faces competition in almost all areas and markets of its business.
Certain of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s competitors in some of these markets may have
greater financial, marketing or other resources, which may allow them to provide services more effectively and at
a lower cost than the Cable & Wireless Communications Group. These competitors, or potential competitors
from other territories who choose to enter the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s market, may adopt
more aggressive pricing policies, undertake more extensive advertising and marketing campaigns or successfully
replicate or impact the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business model. The telecommunications
sector in the markets in which the Cable & Wireless Communications Group operates may experience further
consolidation, which could result in, among other things, competitors with greater scale operating aggressively in
these markets. Failure of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s businesses to compete effectively could
have a material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business, reputation, financial
condition and/or operating results.

**_Additional competition may enter the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s key markets_**

As the markets for some of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s services expand, additional
competition may emerge in the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s key markets and existing
competitors may commit more resources to such markets. For example, in the second half of the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group’s financial year 2008/09, two additional mobile competitors launched in
Panama, raising the number of mobile providers to four, and a new competitor entered the Jamaican mobile
market in 2007. Despite the Cable & Wireless Communications Group taking steps to prepare for additional
competition and the likely growth in market penetration and, therefore, the total size of the market available in its
key markets, there is a risk that the Cable & Wireless Communications Group will lose market share and its
pricing, revenue and/or margins may come under pressure.

In addition, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group may experience additional competition from new
Internet service providers which are able to offer voice, messaging and content services directly to the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group’s customers and its networks and from pay-TV operators, which are able to
offer fixed line and broadband services. For example, increasing customer take-up of free Voice over Internet
Protocol (VoIP) services provided by Internet-based competitors could pose a risk to the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s fixed and mobile international voice calling revenue. In some markets, regulators may
intervene to encourage additional access-based competition by means such as Local Loop Unbundling and
mandated access to mobile networks as well as introducing other measures such as number portability. The

28


-----

impact of increased competition in the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s markets could have a
material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business, reputation, financial
condition and/or operating results.

**_The Cable & Wireless Communications Group may be adversely affected by poor local, national and_**
**_worldwide economic conditions_**

With major operations in the Caribbean, Panama, Macau and Monaco & Islands, the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group operates in 38 countries and offers mobile, broadband, domestic and international fixed
line services to residential and business customers.

The Caribbean economy has suffered from the recent global recession due to its heavy reliance on tourism. In
addition to the direct impact of fewer tourist visitors, the local economies in the Caribbean have suffered from
the subsequent effects of falling gross domestic product and increasing unemployment. This has had an adverse
effect on the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s revenue in the Caribbean and its profits. The other
Cable & Wireless Communications Group businesses have seen a less significant impact of the global recession,
although there has been some impact on revenue, in particular revenue from international voice services in part
reflecting lower levels of tourism and other business activity in the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s
other operating regions.

Should the poor economic conditions continue or recur, there may be resultant fluctuations in exchange rates,
increases in interest rates or inflation and a further adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group’s revenue and profits. Recessionary pressures, including country specific issues, such as visa restrictions
on Chinese mainland tourists travelling to Macau, could, among other things, affect products and services, the
level of tourism experienced by some countries and local consumer and business expenditure on
telecommunications. In addition, some of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s operations are in
developing economies, which historically have experienced more volatility in their general economic conditions.
The impact of poor economic conditions at a local or national level in the countries in which the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group operates or globally could have a material adverse effect on the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group’s business, reputation, financial condition and/or operating results.

**_The Cable & Wireless Communications Group may not be successful in renewing the necessary regulatory_**
**_licences or other operating agreements needed to operate its businesses and such licences may be subject to_**
**_termination, revocation or material alteration in the event of a breach or to promote public interest_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group believes that it has all the necessary regulatory licences and
operating agreements that it needs to operate its present businesses. These licences are limited to a certain period
of time—for example, the current licence to offer telecommunications services in Panama expires in 2016.
Whilst the Cable & Wireless Communications Group actively engages with the applicable governments and
regulators in advance of the expiry of its licences and operating agreements, there can be no guarantee that when
such licences and operating agreements expire, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group will be able to
renew them at all or on similar or commercially viable terms. Some of these licences may also include clauses
which allow the grantor to terminate or revoke or alter them in the event of a default or to promote public
interest. Failure of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group to hold or to continue to hold or obtain the
necessary licences and other operating agreements required to operate its businesses could have a material
adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business, reputation, financial condition and/or
operating results.

**_The Cable & Wireless Communications Group may not be successful in acquiring future spectrum or other_**
**_licences that it needs to offer new mobile data or other services_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group currently offers mobile data services through the Global System
for Mobile Communications (GSM) and UMTS licences in a number of markets. While these licences enable the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group to offer mobile data services today, as technology develops and
customer needs change, it may be necessary to acquire new spectrum licences in the future to provide the Cable
& Wireless Communications Group with additional capacity and/or offer new technologies or services. While the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group actively engages with regulators and governments to ensure that its
spectrum needs are met, there can be no guarantee that future spectrum licences will be made available in certain
or all territories or that they will be made available on commercially viable terms. Failure of the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group to acquire necessary new spectrum licences or other required licences for new
services or products could have a material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s
business, financial condition and/or operating results.

29


-----

**_The Cable & Wireless Communications Group may be affected by unforeseen changes in regulation and_**
**_government policy_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s ability to provide telecommunications services depends in most
countries on government licences, telecommunications regulations and applicable law in the markets in which it
operates. Compliance with these licences and the applicable local laws will often require that the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group companies obtain consents or approvals from regulatory authorities for certain
activities.

Typically, telecommunications licences, including the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s licences,
contain extensive obligations with which the licencee is required to comply. These licences also typically include
provisions for the termination of the licences in specific circumstances, for example, the non-compliance with
licence conditions or for the general public interest.

Future changes to regulation or a significant deterioration in the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s
relationship with relevant regulators in the jurisdictions in which the Cable & Wireless Communications Group
operates may have a material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Communications Group. Failure to acquire
and retain the necessary consents and approvals or in any other way to comply with regulatory requirements or,
alternatively, the costs to the Cable & Wireless Communications Group of complying with new or more onerous
regulations and restrictions could have a material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group’s business, reputation, financial condition and/or operating results.

**_The Cable & Wireless Communications Group may be adversely affected by changes to tax legislation or its_**
**_interpretation or increases in effective tax rates in the jurisdictions in which the Cable & Wireless_**
**_Communications Group operates_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group operates in multiple jurisdictions and its profits are taxed
according to the tax laws of such jurisdictions. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s effective tax rate
may be affected by changes in tax laws or interpretations of tax laws in any given jurisdiction, including those
tax laws relating to the utilisation of capital allowances, net operating losses and tax credit carry forwards,
changes in geographical split of income and expense, and changes in management’s assessment of matters such
as the ability to realise deferred tax assets.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s effective tax rate in any given financial year reflects a variety of
factors that may not be present in the succeeding financial year or years. As a result, the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s effective tax rate may increase in future periods, which could have a material adverse
effect on the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s financial results and, specifically, its net income, cash
flow and earnings may decrease.

**_A number of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s licences include change of control clauses that_**
**_would result in the inability to operate in that location in the event of a change of control_**

A number of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s operating licences include change of control
clauses, which may be triggered by the sale of a business to which those clauses relate, or certain types of
corporate restructuring. The Board believes that the Cable & Wireless Communications Group does not have any
material operating licences which contain a change of control clause that may be triggered by the Scheme or the
Demerger other than those in respect of which consent has been obtained. Notwithstanding the relationships the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group has with local governments and regulators and the full range of legal
resources at its disposal, some of these change of control clauses may restrict the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s strategic options, including the ability to complete any potential disposal of individual
businesses, a combination of businesses or the entire Cable & Wireless Communications Group, and, if triggered,
may lead to some licences being terminated, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group’s business, reputation, financial condition and/or operating results.

**_Technological changes in communication and information technology may render the Cable & Wireless_**
**_Communications Group’s products, services and supporting infrastructure obsolete or uncompetitive_**

The telecommunications industry is subject to rapid and significant changes in technology. Despite the strength
of its existing networks and its investment in product development and supporting infrastructure, it is not
possible to predict with certainty the effect of future technological changes and the associated licences on the

30


-----

industry and on the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s individual businesses. For example, as
technology evolves, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group may need to obtain new and/or additional
regulatory licences, or make significant investments to upgrade its existing networks to new technologies.
Competitors may also acquire rights to newer and more competitive technologies not available to the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group. Additionally, should items of mechanical and electrical plant remain in use
beyond their anticipated service life, these assets may present a risk to service. Any such changes could have a
material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business, reputation, financial
condition and/or operating results.

**_The Cable & Wireless Communications Group relies on other telecommunications operators for network_**
**_access and interconnection and is affected by the behaviour of other market participants that it does not own_**
**_or control_**

Parts of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s operations rely on access to networks that it does not
own or entirely control. In these cases and in some cases where infrastructure such as mobile network towers is
shared, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s operations depend on other network operators to provide
network access and interconnection services for the origination, carriage and/or termination of some of its
telecommunications services.

If the Cable & Wireless Communications Group is unable to obtain and maintain the necessary interconnection
and other transmission services in a timely fashion and on acceptable commercial terms in each country in which
access to other telecommunications operators’ networks is required to introduce or continue to offer its
telecommunications services, this could have a material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group’s business, reputation, financial condition and/or operating results.

**_Concerns about perceived or actual health risks related to mobile communications devices and facilities could_**
**_have an adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Communications Group_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group provides mobile services across many of its markets and also
provides national and international network capacity to mobile operators. Research and studies into the health
risks posed by mobile telephone handsets and transmission facilities are continuing. The Cable & Wireless
Communications Group reviews scientific and medical research and studies, media, legal, regulatory and other
developments, as well as the public perception of risk arising from the use of mobile telephone handsets.

New research and/or increased speculation regarding health risks associated with mobile telephone handsets and
transmission facilities or any subsequent substantiation of such risks could have an adverse impact on the Cable
& Wireless Communications Group’s customer numbers or customers’ usage of mobile devices or could expose
the Cable & Wireless Communications Group to litigation, regulatory intervention and/or new legislation, each
of which could materially adversely affect the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business, reputation,
financial condition and/or operating results.

**_The Cable & Wireless Communications Group is exposed to currency exchange and fluctuation risk_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business is conducted in a number of jurisdictions and in a
number of foreign currencies, predominantly the US dollar and the euro (including currencies either linked or
pegged to the US dollar or other currencies). It is also exposed to a number of other currencies, including
sterling, the Jamaican dollar and the Seychelles rupee, some of which have been and may continue to be volatile
or subject to devaluation, resulting from, among other things, inflationary pressure. It is also possible that
currencies in which the Cable & Wireless Communications Group businesses operate which are currently pegged
to the US dollar such as the Maldivian rufiyaa might be reset or floated, leading to volatility and/or devaluation.
In addition, the income generated by the Cable & Wireless Communications Group is largely in US dollars while
head office costs, pension fund commitments and coupons on the Existing Bonds are in sterling which exposes
the Cable & Wireless Communications Group to the risk of further exchange rate changes. The Cable & Wireless
Communications Group is therefore exposed to movements in exchange rates in relation to foreign currency
receipts and payments, dividend and other income from foreign subsidiaries, reported profits of foreign
subsidiaries and the net asset carrying value of foreign investments. The Cable & Wireless Communications
Group manages and will continue to manage its exposure to movements in exchange rates. Should the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group’s activities not adequately manage such exposure, fluctuations in exchange
rates could have a material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s financial condition
and/or operating results.

31


-----

**_The Cable & Wireless Communications Group may be exposed to restrictions on the access to foreign_**
**_currencies and the repatriation of funds_**

As the Cable & Wireless Communications Group generates cash in a number of overseas markets and in a
number of currencies, if any jurisdiction in which the Cable & Wireless Communications Group, now or in the
future, operates imposes restrictions on access to foreign currencies or the repatriation of funds, such restrictions,
if any, could have a material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business,
reputation, financial condition and/or operating results.

**Risks relating to the Cable & Wireless Communications Group**

**_Transformation initiatives by the Cable & Wireless Communications Group may not be successfully_**
**_implemented or achieve the intended results_**

Since 2000, the vast majority of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group businesses have experienced
liberalisation in the markets where they were previously the monopoly providers of all telecommunications products
and services and liberalisation is expected to occur in certain of the other markets in which the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group operates. In response, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group businesses are
transforming themselves through business initiatives to enhance the customer experience, strengthen their
competitive positions and improve their cost efficiency. For example, a key initiative is the “One Caribbean”
transformation programme which was launched in 2008, in which 13 subsidiaries are being brought together under
one management structure, with a single brand and a common set of products and services. This programme is
complex as it involves, inter alia, managing and integrating the businesses of 13 sets of stakeholders.

Historically, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group has dedicated, and expects in the future to dedicate,
significant resources to drive the transformation of its businesses, as well as integrating any businesses that it has
acquired or may acquire in the future. As with all business transformation activities, implementation of these
elements is complex, time-consuming and expensive, and failure of the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group to execute the plans effectively or achieve the intended results could have a material adverse effect on the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business, reputation, financial condition and/or operating results.

**_New sources of revenue growth may prove insufficient or fail to develop_**

New revenue sources, such as mobile value added services, pay-TV entertainment, managed services and
enterprise solutions, are crucial to the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s strategy. If these revenue
sources fail to develop as well as the Cable & Wireless Communications Group expects, revenue may fall as
other core services reach full market penetration. To the extent that the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group’s new product development and marketing strategies are not wholly successful, this could have a material
adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business, reputation, financial condition and/or
operating results.

**_The Cable & Wireless Communications Group may not accurately forecast demand for its products and/or_**
**_services, and as a result, may have excess resources or suffer from resource shortages_**

The level of resources required in the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business is sensitive to
changes in the actual demand for Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s services compared with forecasts
of demand for such services. Accurate forecasting of demand in volatile and dynamic telecommunications
sectors such as those in which the Cable & Wireless Communications Group operates can be very difficult,
particularly in times of rapidly changing economic conditions and uncertain consumer demand. However,
competition for customers drives telecommunications companies, including the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group, to invest in capacity and new technologies. The Cable & Wireless Communications
Group commits substantial capital expenditure each year to the development of its networks and technologies. If
actual market conditions are less favourable than those projected, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group
will have excess resources because actual customer demand will fall short of projected customer demand. This
also exposes the Cable & Wireless Communications Group to the risk that it may be unable to recoup the
investments it has made and to asset impairment charges. In times of growing demand, either generally or for
particular services, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group may have insufficient resources and, as a
result, may not be able to meet customer demand in a timely manner. Failure to meet customer needs may
adversely affect customer relationships, weaken its competitive position and reduce the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s revenue and could have a material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s business, reputation, financial condition and/or operating results.

**_After the Demerger, use of the “Cable & Wireless” brand will be shared by both the Cable & Wireless_**
**_Communications Group and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group_**

The value of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business depends, to a certain extent, upon the
Cable & Wireless Trademarks. After the Demerger, both the Cable & Wireless Communications Group and the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group will share the use of the “Cable & Wireless” name and have ongoing rights
to use the Cable & Wireless Trademarks.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group currently protects the Cable & Wireless Trademarks and its other
intellectual property rights through a variety of methods, including obtaining and maintaining registered
intellectual property rights, maintaining the confidentiality of valuable technical information and the enforcement
of its legal rights. Details of the ownership and rights to use the Cable & Wireless Trademarks are set out in the
section entitled “Cable & Wireless Communications Group Business—Intellectual Property Arrangements”.

Use of the Cable & Wireless Trademarks by the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group could cause diminution in
the value of the Cable & Wireless Trademarks. For example, the Cable & Wireless Trademarks could be
damaged if they are used inappropriately or in respect of goods or services of a poor quality, or if there are
complaints, adverse publicity or litigation affecting the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group. It could also make
it more difficult to enforce intellectual property rights in the Cable & Wireless Trademarks against third parties,
for example if they are used in a descriptive manner, or if the distinctiveness of the Cable & Wireless
Trademarks is diluted due to confusion among consumers. Consequently, both the value of the Cable & Wireless
Trademarks to the Cable & Wireless Communications Group, and the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group’s business, could be negatively impacted by the use of the Cable & Wireless Trademarks by the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group.

Prior to the Demerger Effective Time, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group will be granted rights under
the Cable & Wireless Communications Licence to use the Cable & Wireless Trademarks in the Cable & Wireless
Communications Territory and in relation to the “Cable & Wireless Globe” logo and the acronym “CWC” only,
globally. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group is also authorised to use the Cable & Wireless
Trademarks outside the Cable & Wireless Communications Territory in relation to its Carrier Business and for
certain incidental uses and certain ‘grandfathered’ use on existing materials. Under the terms of the Cable &
Wireless Communications Licence, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group is largely unrestricted in its
use of the Cable & Wireless Trademarks within the Cable & Wireless Communications Territory but is restricted
outside the Cable & Wireless Communications Territory as described in the section entitled “Cable & Wireless
_Communications Group Business—Intellectual Property Arrangements” of this document. Therefore, to the_
extent the Cable & Wireless Communications Group has activities outside the Cable & Wireless
Communications Territory, it must, subject to these limited exceptions, operate under trademarks other than the
Cable & Wireless Trademarks. As both the Cable & Wireless Communications Group and the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group have certain rights across the world to use the Cable & Wireless Trademarks in connection
with their respective Carrier Businesses, this could cause confusion among customers and potential customers.

Under the terms of the Cable & Wireless Communications Licence, the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group is largely unrestricted in its use of the Cable & Wireless Trademarks within the Cable & Wireless
Communications Territory. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s use of the Cable & Wireless
Trademarks outside the Cable & Wireless Communications Territory is severely restricted, save for use in
relation to its Carrier Business and for certain incidental use or certain grandfathered use. Therefore, to the extent
the Cable & Wireless Communications Group has activities outside the Cable & Wireless Communications
Territory which are not part of its Carrier Business, it must operate under trademarks other than the Cable &
Wireless Trademarks. As both the Cable & Wireless Communications Group and the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group have rights across the world to use the Cable & Wireless Trademarks in connection with their
respective Carrier Businesses, this could cause confusion among customers and potential customers.

Under the terms of the Cable & Wireless Communications Licence, the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group is responsible, within the Cable & Wireless Communications Territory, and in relation to the “Cable &
Wireless Globe” logo and the acronym “CWC” only, also outside the Cable & Wireless Communications
Territory for prosecuting applications for registration and maintaining existing trademark registrations of the
Cable & Wireless Trademarks at its own cost. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group could, through its
own acts or omissions, fail to obtain the registration of trademark applications, allow registered trademarks to
lapse or allow registered trademarks to become subject to challenges of invalidity (e.g. through non-usage of the
registered trademark within the jurisdictions in the Cable & Wireless Communications Territory), thereby

33


-----

reducing the value of the Cable & Wireless Trademarks to the Cable & Wireless Communications Group. This
could have a material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business, reputation,
financial condition and/or operating results.

**_The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s joint ventures in which the Cable & Wireless_**
**_Communications Group does not have management control may underperform_**

Despite representation on the boards of these companies, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group does not
have management control of its five joint ventures. In the year ended 31 March 2009, the Cable & Wireless
Communication Group’s joint ventures contributed US$60 million or 9% to total operating profit of US$634
million. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group is therefore able to influence but not always control the
performance or decisions made by these joint ventures, and, as such, a lack of business and management control
may result in strategic differences with the Cable & Wireless Communications Group, poor performance of these
businesses and constraints on their ability to distribute funds to the joint venture partners. The Cable & Wireless
Communications Group seeks to influence positively the performance of the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group’s joint ventures through regular dialogue with key stakeholders, active engagement with local
management, operational involvement where practicable and enforcing its rights under the shareholders’
agreements and its representation on the boards of the relevant companies. The Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s ability to exercise its rights under relevant shareholders’ agreements and otherwise to
influence the performance of its joint ventures may be additionally constrained by political factors, particularly in
the case of joint ventures with the government in the relevant jurisdiction. Should these actions fail to mitigate
the risk of the potential poor performance of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s joint ventures
successfully, this could have a material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s
business, reputation, financial condition and/or operating results. The Cable & Wireless Communications
Group’s joint venture partners may also face financial difficulties which may prevent them from supporting the
operations or from investing further capital in the joint venture.

**_The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s ability to dispose of investments in certain subsidiaries and_**
**_joint ventures may be constrained_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s investments in certain subsidiaries and joint ventures are subject
to pre-emption rights which give the owners of such subsidiaries or joint venture companies the first option to
acquire any shares in any such company that become available either on a resale or new issue. Should the Cable
& Wireless Communications Group wish to dispose of its shares in any such company, such pre-emption rights
may restrict a commercial tendering process for these shares and, therefore, reduce the maximum value realisable
upon a disposal. In addition, the agreements governing the rights and obligations of the other shareholders may
require the shares to be sold at a pre-determined price or at a price determined pursuant to a specified formula.
For example, under the terms of the Dhiraagu (the Maldives) shareholders’ agreement, any transfer of shares by a
shareholder is subject to pre-emption rights, whereby the Cable & Wireless Communications Group has the
obligation to first offer the relevant shares to the other shareholders at a price to be mutually agreed or otherwise
determined by an independent accountant. Such price could be materially lower than the price that could be
obtained through a third-party tendering process. This could have a material adverse effect on the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group’s business, reputation and financial condition and/or operating results.
Moreover, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s ability to dispose of interests in certain subsidiaries
and joint ventures may be constrained by political factors in a particular jurisdiction and the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group may make decisions with regard to any such disposal based on political and commercial
considerations rather than by reference to its legal or contractual rights. Any inability of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group to dispose of an interest in a subsidiary or joint venture at a time, at a price or to a third
party of its choosing could have a material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s
business, reputation, financial condition and/or operating results.

**_The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s operations in some markets are constrained by political_**
**_factors_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group operates in 38 countries. The governments in these countries
differ widely with respect to structure, constitution, stability and level of regulation. Many of the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group’s operations depend on governmental approval and regulatory decisions and
the Cable & Wireless Communications Group provides services to governmental organisations in certain
markets. In addition, due to political pressure in a territory, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group may
make decisions influenced by political and commercial considerations rather than fully exploiting its contractual

34


-----

or legal rights or all opportunities available to it. Accordingly, the operations of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group may be constrained by the relevant political environment and may be adversely affected
by such constraints as well as by changes to the political structure or government representatives in any of the
markets in which the Cable & Wireless Communications Group operates. In certain countries in which the Cable
& Wireless Communications Group operates, political, security and economic changes may result in political and
regulatory uncertainty and civil unrest. In addition, certain countries in which the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group operates or in which the Cable & Wireless Communications Group may operate in the
future, face significant challenges relating to lack, or poor condition, of physical infrastructure, including
transportation, electricity generation and transmission. Such countries may also be subject to a higher risk of
inflationary pressures which could increase the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s operating costs and
decrease consumer demand and spending power. Each of these factors could, individually or in aggregate, have a
material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business, reputation, financial
condition and/or operating results.

**_The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s ability to refinance its existing debt and raise new debt may_**
**_be constrained_**

In addition to the Notes, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group currently has in issue two series of bonds
which mature in 2012 and 2019 (the Existing Bonds), as well as bank facilities due for repayment in 2013
comprising a US$400 million revolving credit facility and a US$100 million term loan facility (the New Credit
**Facilities). The Cable & Wireless Communications Group does not need to refinance any of its existing debt until**
2012, when certain of the Existing Bonds mature. Although the Cable & Wireless Communications Group is not
reliant on the refinancing of existing debt, should the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s financial
condition or general economic conditions at the relevant time prevent the Cable & Wireless Communications Group
from successfully refinancing its existing debt, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group would have more
limited access to funds in the longer term to finance its investment in the development of the business, any potential
acquisitions and dividend payments. The failure to refinance its existing debt could have a material adverse effect
on the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business, reputation, financial condition and/or operating results.

For further details on the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s existing debt facilities, refer to the section
entitled “Cable & Wireless Communications Group Operating and Financial Review—Comparative Overview of
_Financial Condition—Aggregate contractual debt obligations” and “Description of Certain Financing_
_Arrangements”._

**_The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s debt obligations require significant amounts of cash and_**
**_impose certain covenants on the Cable & Wireless Communications Group_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s credit facilities impose financial and other restrictive covenants
that limit the ability of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group to, among other things, borrow additional
funds, create security of assets and/or pay dividends. In addition, to the extent that Cable & Wireless
Communications remains the principal debtor under the Convertible Bonds, the Convertible Bonds may, subject
to a carve-out up to a specified threshold and certain other customary exceptions, restrict or limit the issuance by
certain members of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group of secured capital markets indebtedness
capable of being listed (or the giving of guarantees or indemnities in respect of secured capital markets
indebtedness which is capable of being listed) unless the benefit of such security guarantee or indemnity, or
similar security, guarantee or indemnity is extended to the Convertible Bonds or otherwise permitted in
accordance with, and subject to, the terms of the Convertible Bonds. Cable & Wireless Communications is not
required to issue any such capital markets indebtedness in the short term.

The Convertible Bonds also contain anti-dilution provisions related to capital distributions and extraordinary
dividends which, subject to a threshold up to a specified yield in the case of extraordinary dividends, will require
such distributions or a downward adjustment to the effective conversion price of the Convertible Bonds on the
making or paying of dividends by Cable & Wireless Communications (see “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Convertible Bonds” for further information on the Convertible Bond negative pledge and anti-_
dilution provisions and the conditions under which Cable & Wireless Communications may remain the principal
debtor under the Convertible Bonds).

In the case of the Notes, New Credit Facilities and the Existing Bonds and, subject to the above paragraph, the
Convertible Bonds, the failure to comply with such covenants or other provisions may constitute an event of
default. Such events of default may lead to the acceleration of the repayment of principal and accrued (but

35


-----

unpaid) interest under the Notes, New Credit Facilities and the Existing Bonds and/or the Convertible Bonds, as
applicable, which could have a material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s
business, reputation, financial condition and/or operating results. In addition, payment obligations on this
indebtedness require significant amounts of cash, which may impact the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group’s operations.

If any financing arrangements (including the New Credit Facilities, Existing Bonds and, if applicable, the
Convertible Bonds) were withdrawn or in default or the Cable & Wireless Communications Group was unable to
meet accelerated repayment requirements triggered as a result of an event of default, this could have a material
adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business, reputation, financial condition and/or
operating results. In addition, a breach of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s banking covenants
could have a material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business, reputation,
financial condition and/or operating results. In the case of the Convertible Bonds, the failure to comply with such
covenants and other provisions may constitute an event of default. Such events of default may lead to
acceleration of the repayment of principal and accrued (but unpaid) interest under the Convertible Bonds which
could have a material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business, reputation,
financial condition and/or operating results. In the event of a breach of covenant under the New Credit Facilities
or Convertible Bonds, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group would seek to renegotiate the terms of the
relevant debt or obtain a waiver in respect of any breach, but it may not be successful in such effort. In the event
that the Cable & Wireless Communications Group is unable to meet its payment or other obligations under the
Convertible Bonds, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group will seek to refinance the debt owed under the
Convertible Bonds in order to repay the Convertible Bonds to the extent possible under their terms, or inter alia,
buy back, cash settle or exchange the Convertible Bonds by means of an appropriate liability management
transaction.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s credit facilities, the Existing Bonds and the Convertible Bonds
are described in the section entitled “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements” of this document.

**_The funding requirements or obligations in respect of the defined benefit pension schemes may increase_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group operates defined benefit and defined contribution pension
schemes for its current and former UK and overseas employees. The funding position of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s defined benefit pension schemes will be affected by the investment performance of the
pension funds’ investments, the life expectancy of the schemes’ members, changes in the actuarial assumptions
used to assess the pension schemes’ funding position, changes in the rate of inflation and interest rates, the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s financial position, as well as other changes in economic conditions.

Following the Demerger, the main UK defined benefit pension scheme, the Cable & Wireless Superannuation
Fund, is expected to have a deficit. The deficit may increase or decrease based on a number of actuarial factors,
changes to other assumptions and market conditions. Changes to the funding level may continue to require the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group to increase its cash contributions to the Cable & Wireless
Superannuation Fund on terms to be agreed with the trustee. Although the pension scheme deficit on the IAS 19
accounting basis is expressed in US dollars the ongoing scheme specific deficit and any contributions paid to the
Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund are paid in sterling, creating an exchange rate risk.

Furthermore, the trustee of the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund has the power to trigger the winding-up
of the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund if the trustee resolves that it is in the best interests of the members
of the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund as a whole. If the trustee were to use this power, the participating
employers in the Cable & Wireless Communications Group would become liable by statute to make
contributions to the pension scheme to remove any deficit calculated on the more conservative, buy-out basis,
enabling the trustee of the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund to purchase individual annuity policies for all
members of the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund.

The rules of the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund also give the scheme actuary a wide power to determine
the contributions that the Cable & Wireless Communications Group is required to make to the Cable & Wireless
Superannuation Fund. The next triennial actuarial valuation of the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund is due
as at 31 March 2010, following which Cable & Wireless Communications will have, under statute, until 30 June
2011 to agree such valuation and any relevant contributions with the trustee of the Cable & Wireless
Superannuation Fund. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group expects that the 31 March 2010 valuation
will be completed on a basis consistent with, and that the approach taken to funding any deficit will be consistent
with, that agreed with the trustee of the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund under the heads of terms signed

36


-----

on 20 January 2010. However, if the pension trustee and Cable & Wireless Communications are unable to agree
the amount and timing of the relevant contribution by 30 June 2011, the process would be referred to the
Pensions Regulator, who has certain powers to impose a specified rate of contribution upon, or make other orders
applying to, Cable & Wireless Communications.

Beyond that timeframe, changes to the funding position of the pension schemes in the longer term may lead to
the Cable & Wireless Communications Group being required to contribute additional funding to satisfy pension
obligations (including any ongoing liability to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide defined benefit pension
schemes). This could have a material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business,
reputation, financial condition and/or operating results.

**_The Cable & Wireless Communications Group has credit facilities with interest payment obligations that_**
**_could be affected by changes in interest rates_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group has senior bank facilities of US$500 million at variable interest
rates, as described in the section entitled “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements” of this document.
The Cable & Wireless Communications Group is, therefore, exposed to fluctuations in interest rates which could
affect its profits. Should the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s financial performance not be sufficient
to meet the associated interest and repayment obligations as well as the financial covenants, this would result in
an event of default which, if not resolved or waived, may result in the relevant financing arrangement, and (as a
result of cross-default provisions) other financing arrangements, being withdrawn and any outstanding
indebtedness being repayable immediately. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group may not be able to
repay such facilities which could have a material adverse effect on its business, reputation, financial condition
and/or operating results. In addition, a breach of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s banking
covenants could have a material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business,
reputation, financial condition and/or operating results. In the event of a breach of covenant under any financing
arrangement, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group would seek to renegotiate the terms of the relevant
debt or obtain a waiver in respect of any breach, but it may not be successful in such effort.

**_Failures or interruptions may affect the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s network and/or_**
**_information technology (IT) systems_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s networks are a critical asset in providing its customers with
efficient and extensive telecommunications services. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group is reliant on
its IT systems for operation and management of its business, including its networks, the provision of services to
its customers, customer billing and the provision of information regarding most aspects of its financial and
operational performance. Like other telecommunications operators, the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group’s network and/or IT systems are vulnerable to interruption and damage from security breaches, software
malfunction, terrorist action, power outages, human error or other factors outside its control. The Cable &
Wireless Communications Group’s network and/or IT systems are also vulnerable to interruption as a result of
equipment failures particularly for ageing equipment.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group has in place business continuity and disaster recovery plans
including contingency equipment and suppliers, network monitoring and resilience plans. However, there can be
no certainty that such plans and systems will be effective in the event that they need to be activated. The failure
or interruption of all or part of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s network and/or IT systems would
restrict the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s ability to continue to operate at its current performance
levels and may result in both the loss of customers and potential exposure to claims from customers based on loss
of service. Should the Cable & Wireless Communications Group experience problems with the integrity of its
data and the adequacy of some or all of the associated systems and processes, it could have an impact on its
transformation initiatives and its ability to provide services and conduct its operations. Any insurance maintained
to protect against certain of these risks may not be adequate to cover any loss suffered by the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group, including lost sales or increased expenses. Each of these matters could have a material
adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business, reputation, financial condition and/or
operating results.

**_Third parties may gain access to the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s network and/or sensitive data_**
**_unlawfully_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group is dependent on third-party suppliers for equipment, network
infrastructure, components and services, for example, it carries sensitive data across its networks globally on

37


-----

behalf of a number of its customers. Despite security management across the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group’s network, there is a risk that third parties may gain access unlawfully to the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s networks and/or highly sensitive data. Should steps that the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group takes to prevent occurrences of this unlawful conduct be unsuccessful the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group could become subject to regulatory actions, or its customers could seek to
claim compensation for breach of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s contractual obligations or, in
severe cases, terminate their contracts with the Cable & Wireless Communications Group. Each of these matters
could have a material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business, reputation,
financial condition and/or operating results.

**_The Cable & Wireless Communications Group is reliant on third parties for certain support activities_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group has outsourced a number of support activities to third parties,
including the provision of call centre services in Jamaica, St. Lucia, Panama and Monaco, the management of the
stock of mobile handsets in Jamaica, the provision of key equipment and certain network operations contracts in
Kosovo. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group has also entered into a Transitional Services Agreement
with Cable & Wireless Worldwide pursuant to which each party provides the other with certain services. The
specified services under the Transitional Services Agreement include services in respect of information
technology, tax and networks and other services to be agreed. In the event that such third parties, including the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group, fail to deliver contracted activities and services and the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s service to its customers is interrupted, this could have a material adverse effect on the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business, reputation, financial condition and/or operating results.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group also may not be able to recover monies paid to such third parties
for their services or obtain contractual damages to which it may be entitled (if any) in such an event. This could
have a material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business, reputation, financial
condition and/or operating results.

**_The Cable & Wireless Communications Group is reliant on third-party standards and protocols_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group is reliant on third-party standards and protocols in its delivery of
communication services. The operation of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business depends on
the efficient and uninterrupted operation of communication networks. The Cable & Wireless Communications
Group’s mobile networks are predominantly based on GSM standards managed by the GSM Association and the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s IP networks are based on standards from IETF. These standards
could be compromised due to various factors, including but not limited to, power loss, telecommunications
failures, attacks, data corruption, security breaches, software malfunction, natural disasters or other acts not in its
control. If either of these standards were to be compromised, or in the case of GSM, the encryption code
breached, customers could lose faith in the integrity of the affected mobile networks and move to providers with
alternative delivery methods such as CDMA where possible. Any compromise in third-party standards and
protocols or customers moving to providers with alternative delivery methods could have a material adverse
effect on the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business, reputation, financial condition and/or
operating results of the affected telecommunications companies, including the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group.

**_The Cable & Wireless Communications Group is exposed to the risks of internal fraud or illegal activities by_**
**_third parties_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group expects to maintain an effective system of internal controls after the
Demerger; however, any failure to implement such controls may result in the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group not being able to report its financial results accurately or prevent fraud. Current and potential stakeholders
could therefore lose confidence in the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s financial reporting, which would
harm its business and the trading price of its securities. In addition, third parties may also utilise the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group’s communications networks for illegal activities which are beyond its control or
subject them to damage, theft or other loss. For example, hackers could use the Cable & Wireless Communications
broadband services to hack into websites and Internet accounts, or broadband users could download music content
illegally. Any such fraudulent or illegal activities could have a material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s business, reputation, financial condition and/or operating results. Notwithstanding
anything in this risk factor, this risk factor should not be taken as implying that any company in the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group with securities admitted to the Official List will be unable to comply with its
obligations as a company with securities admitted to the Official List.

**_The Cable & Wireless Communications Group may be adversely affected by any failure to protect or any_**
**_infringement on its intellectual property rights, or may infringe on the proprietary intellectual property rights_**
**_of others_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group uses its intellectual property rights in several different countries,
and it cannot be certain that the steps that have been taken to protect its intellectual property rights, including its
trademarks know-how and inventions, will be adequate or that third parties will not infringe or misappropriate its
intellectual property rights. While the Cable & Wireless Communications Group intends to enforce its
intellectual property rights vigorously, it may not be successful in doing so and there can be no assurance that
despite internal controls, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group may inadvertently infringe or
misappropriate the intellectual property rights of third parties. In the communications industry, fast evolving
technologies and know-how may increase the risk of such inadvertent violations by the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group or by third parties. Any such infringement or misappropriation of, and/or absence of
strong legal protection for, its intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group’s business, reputation, financial condition and/or operating results. For further
details of any material litigation in which the Cable & Wireless Communications Group is engaged, see the
section entitled “Cable & Wireless Communications Group Business—Material Litigation”.

**_The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s success depends on attracting and retaining highly skilled_**
**_and qualified management and employees and the Cable & Wireless Communications Group could suffer_**
**_material adverse effects if it fails to do so_**

The recruitment and retention of highly skilled management and employees is important to the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s success. The number of suitable employees at higher levels may be limited, especially
in certain geographic locations, and key employees, many of whom have significant experience within the Cable
& Wireless Communications Group and the telecommunications sector, may be difficult to replace. There can be
no certainty that the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s succession planning, retention policies and
incentive plans will be successful in attracting and retaining the right calibre of key employees and management.
The failure to retain and attract key employees and management could have a material adverse effect on the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business, reputation, financial condition and/or operating results.

**_Exposure to industrial action by the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s employees could affect the_**
**_Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s operations_**

In parts of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s operations where there is significant union
representation (for example, in some countries in the Caribbean, most notably Trinidad and Tobago and
Barbados), the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s businesses may be exposed to the risk of industrial
action by its employees. In the last 12 months there has been significant union activity, including the threat of
strike action in Barbados relating to proposed redundancies in LIME and in Trinidad and Tobago relating to
proposals for changes to working arrangements in TSTT. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group has
developed industrial relations programmes and formal and informal employee communication channels, and
regularly consults with employees and their representatives on issues that affect them. However, the risk of
industrial action remains and may become more pronounced in connection with the transformation programmes,
and any such action could have a material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s
business, reputation, financial condition and/or operating results.

**_The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s operations could be affected by natural disasters or climate_**
**_change_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business operations are subject to interruption by natural
disasters, including, but not limited to, hurricanes, fire, floods and earthquakes and other events beyond its
control. As the Cable & Wireless Communications Group operates in certain jurisdictions in which existing
infrastructure and telecommunications equipment (such as cables) may not be able to withstand a major natural
disaster and/or in which emergency response time may be significant, prolonged recovery time could be required
to resume operations. Moreover, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group operates in jurisdictions
susceptible to natural disasters, in particular, the Caribbean, which pose a seasonal risk to its business operations.
For example, in September 2004, Hurricane Ivan hit the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s operations
in Grenada, Jamaica and the Cayman Islands. This had a major impact on the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group’s network, operations and employees in these markets, with the required restoration work incurring
significant time and cost to complete. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group has in place disaster
recovery plans. However, there can be no certainty that such natural disasters will not cause loss and/or damage

39


-----

in spite of the disaster recovery plans and failure to activate such plans effectively could have a material adverse
effect on the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business, reputation, financial condition and/or
operating results. Certain countries in which the Cable & Wireless Communications Group operates are exposed
to the developing threat of climate change. For example, in the past, the Maldives has experienced tidal surges
and flooding that may have been caused in part by climate change. In the future, certain countries in which the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group operates may be affected by the environmental impacts of climate
change, such as raised sea and air temperatures, extreme weather conditions or food shortages, which, in turn,
could have an effect on the habitability of these countries and the cost and feasibility of providing
telecommunications services. These consequences may have a material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s business, financial condition and operating results. Any insurance maintained to
protect against certain of these risks may not be adequate to cover losses suffered by Cable & Wireless
Communications Group, including lost sales or increased expenses.

**_The Cable & Wireless Communications Group may be adversely affected by complaints, litigation and adverse_**
**_publicity_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group may be adversely affected by complaints and litigation including
from customers, competitors or regulatory authorities, as well as any adverse publicity that the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group may attract. The risk of litigation being brought against the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group is higher in certain areas in which it operates, notably Panama and the Caribbean. For
example, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group is currently involved in litigation proceedings with a
Caribbean competitor (for further information see the section entitled “Cable & Wireless Communications Group
_Business—Material Litigation”). Any litigation, complaints or adverse publicity could have a material adverse_
effect on the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business, reputation, financial condition and/or
operating results.

**_A number of estimates and assumptions have been used in the preparation of the Cable & Wireless_**
**_Communications Group’s consolidated financial statements_**

The preparation of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s consolidated financial statements requires
management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. These estimates and associated assumptions are based on
historical experience and various other factors that are considered to be reasonable under the circumstances.
These estimates and assumptions form the basis of judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily available from other sources. Should the actual results differ from these estimates and
assumptions, this could have a material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s
business, reputation, financial condition and/or operating results.

**_The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s operations, facilities, products and employees are subject to a_**
**_wide range of health and safety regulations and concerns_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group is subject to certain environmental, health and safety laws and
regulations that affect its operations, facilities, products and employees in each of the jurisdictions in which it
operates. There is a risk that the Cable & Wireless Communications Group may have to incur expenditures to
cover environmental and health liabilities to maintain compliance with current or future environmental, health
and safety laws and regulations or to undertake any necessary remediation.

In addition, certain employees or contractors of Cable & Wireless Communications Group may be required to
work under extreme or dangerous conditions (for example, heights or weather) or in extreme or dangerous
locations. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group is subject to potentially material liabilities, including
those related to personal injuries or property damage, that may result from working under extreme or dangerous
conditions or in extreme or dangerous locations.

**Until the Demerger Effective Time, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group will be a part of the Cable &**
**Wireless Group. The Demerger may not occur. Therefore, in addition to the risks set forth below, see**
**“Annex A – Risk Factors relating to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group”.**

40


-----

**Risks relating to the Demerger Proposals**

**_The Demerger Proposals may not be approved and the Demerger may not complete_**

Completion of the Demerger Proposals is subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions precedent,
including the approval of the Scheme at the Court Meeting and the approval of the Scheme, the Demerger
Proposals and the certain incentives proposals by the Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Shareholders at the
General Meeting, details of which are contained in paragraph 3.4 of Part V: “Explanatory Statement” of the
Cable and Wireless plc Circular. If the Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Shareholders do not approve the Scheme
at the Court Meeting or the Court fails to sanction the Scheme or confirm the Cable and Wireless plc Reduction
of Capital, Cable & Wireless Communications will not be inserted as a new holding company and the Demerger
will not complete. If the Court does not approve the Cable & Wireless Communications Reduction of Capital, the
Demerger will not complete. If completion of the Demerger does not occur in part or in whole, then the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group may experience a delay in the execution of its strategic objectives and may be
unable to realise the benefits for Cable & Wireless Communications Shareholders that the Directors believe will
result from the Demerger.

**_The Demerger may not occur even after the Scheme has become effective_**

Although the Demerger Proposals are intended to be implemented in full, in the unexpected event that the
Demerger does not occur after Cable & Wireless Communications has become the new holding company of the
Cable & Wireless Group pursuant to the Scheme, the Cable & Wireless Communications ‘B’ Shares held by the
Cable & Wireless Communications Shareholders will not be cancelled and Cable & Wireless Communications
Shareholders will not receive Cable & Wireless Worldwide Ordinary Shares. If the Demerger does not become
effective by the Demerger Long Stop Date, the Cable & Wireless Communications ‘B’ Shares will be
redenominated, reorganised and reclassified as Cable & Wireless Communications Ordinary Shares, such
redenomination, reorganisation and reclassification subject only to Admission of those shares to the Official List
and to trading on the London Stock Exchange.

The Demerger Long Stop Date has been set by the Cable and Wireless plc Board based on its determination of
the minimum practicable period necessary for Cable & Wireless Communications to convene the Demerger
Court Hearing and, in the event any objections or issues are raised at such Demerger Court Hearing, to enable it
to have an opportunity to respond to such objections or issues. The relevant resolutions to effect the
redenomination, reorganisation and reclassification of the Cable & Wireless Communications ‘B’ Shares should
the Demerger not become effective will be passed prior to the Scheme Effective Time, and will be conditional on
announcement by Cable & Wireless Communications on an RIS that the Demerger will not proceed. The
Demerger Agreement requires Cable and Wireless plc to notify Cable & Wireless Communications by no later
than the Demerger Long Stop Date if the Demerger will not be effective by such date and, upon receipt of such
notice, Cable & Wireless Communications must forthwith announce on an RIS that the Demerger will not
proceed.

In such case, a new application for Admission of the additional Cable & Wireless Communications Ordinary
Shares into which the Cable & Wireless Communications ‘B’ Shares will be redenominated, reorganised and
reclassified will be made as soon as reasonably practicable after such announcement has been made and, in any
event, no later than 5 Business Days after the date of such announcement.

**_The Cable & Wireless Communications Group may not realise the anticipated benefits of the Demerger_**

There can be no guarantee that the Cable & Wireless Communications Group will realise any or all of the
anticipated benefits of the Demerger, either in a timely manner or at all.

For example, although the Cable & Wireless Communications Group expects that the Demerger will result in
benefits to it as a standalone entity, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group may not realise those benefits
because of the challenges relating to operating as a standalone business. These challenges include completing the
separation of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group from the Cable & Wireless Communications Group,
retaining key employees, retaining existing and attracting new customers, implementing and maintaining
sufficient internal controls, procedures and policies to operate as a standalone business, potential disruption of
the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s continuing operations and distraction of its management,
difficulty in effectively marketing and communicating the capabilities of each standalone company, the potential
need to demonstrate to customers that the Demerger will not result in adverse changes in customer service
standards or in a company’s business, impairment of relationships with employees, suppliers or customers as a
result of the Demerger and the ongoing implications of sharing the Cable & Wireless Trademarks. Any failure of

41


-----

the Cable & Wireless Communications Group to meet the challenges involved in operating as a standalone
business or to realise any of the anticipated benefits of the Demerger could harm the business. This could have a
material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business, reputation, financial
condition and/or operating results.

**_The financial results of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group after the Demerger may be more_**
**_volatile than those of the Cable & Wireless Group before the Demerger_**

Cable and Wireless plc currently benefits from diversification, resulting from operating the business of the Cable
& Wireless Worldwide Group alongside the business of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group. These
two businesses operate in different geographical markets with different target customers, which tends to
moderate financial and operational volatility. Following the Demerger, that diversification will end and the Cable
& Wireless Communications Group may demonstrate increased volatility in its operations and/or financial
results.

**_The Demerger Proposals may give rise to unanticipated tax consequences_**

Cable and Wireless plc has undertaken tax due diligence to identify the likely tax treatment of the Demerger
Proposals and has structured the Demerger Proposals so as to reduce any adverse tax consequences. However,
tax law and practice can be subject to differing interpretations and, in some jurisdictions, the tax authorities are
entitled to exercise discretion in how the tax law should be applied in certain cases. Consequently, the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group is not able to guarantee that the tax authorities in each jurisdiction in which
companies in the Cable & Wireless Communications Group have a taxable presence will interpret or apply the
relevant tax law and practice in the manner in which the Cable & Wireless Communications Group anticipates
and this may give rise to adverse consequences.

**_The Cable & Wireless Communications Group will have significant indemnification and guarantee_**
**_obligations in favour of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group after the Demerger_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group have entered into
certain Demerger Transaction Agreements, as described in “Cable & Wireless Communications Group
_Business—Material Contracts”, that govern the allocation of the assets and liabilities of the businesses, their_
post-Demerger obligations to each other in respect of, among other things, taxes and transitional services and
their respective guarantee and indemnity obligations. Subject to certain conditions contained in such agreements,
each of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has agreed to
indemnify the other and provide guarantees in favour of the other in respect of certain liabilities associated with
the indemnifying or guarantor party’s business prior to the Demerger. The amounts payable by the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group pursuant to such indemnity obligations or guarantees could be significant and
could have a material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business, reputation,
financial condition and/or operating results. See “Cable & Wireless Communications Group Operating and
_Financial Review—Off balance sheet arrangements” for further information._

**Risks relating to the Notes**

**_The Cable & Wireless Communications Group requires a significant amount of cash to make payments on the_**
**_Notes and to service its debt; its ability to generate sufficient cash depends on a number of factors, many of_**
**_which are beyond its control_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s ability to make payments on and to refinance its debt will
depend on its future operating performance and ability to generate sufficient cash. This depends, to some extent,
on general economic, financial, competitive, market, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are
beyond the its control, as well as the other factors discussed herein.

Historically, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group has met its debt service and other cash requirements
with cash flows from operations and borrowing facilities. Although the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group’s expected cash flows from operating activities, together with cash on hand and available borrowing
facilities, is believed to be adequate to meet its anticipated liquidity and debt service needs, there is a risk that in
the future the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business will not generate sufficient cash flows from
operating activities, or that future financing will not be available to it in an amount sufficient to enable it to pay
its debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund its other liquidity needs. See “Cable & Wireless
_Communications Group Operating and Financial Review” and “Capitalisation”. If the Cable & Wireless_

42


-----

Communications Group’s future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay its
obligations as they mature or to fund its liquidity needs, it may be forced to reduce or delay its business plan, and
capital expenditures; sell assets; obtain additional debt or equity capital; or restructure or refinance all or a
portion of its debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.

There is a risk that the Cable & Wireless Communications Group would not be able to accomplish any of these
alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. If it obtains additional debt financing, the related
risks it now faces will increase.

**_The Cable & Wireless Communications Group may incur additional indebtedness both prior to and following_**
**_the completion of the Demerger_**

The terms of the indenture governing the Notes and the New Credit Facilities will limit the circumstances in
which the Cable & Wireless Communications Group may incur additional indebtedness, but will not prohibit it
from doing so. Consequently, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group may incur additional indebtedness
both prior to and following the completion of the Demerger. Any such incurrence of additional indebtedness
could inhibit the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s ability to pursue its business strategies.

**_Agreements governing the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s New Credit Facilities may restrict the_**
**_Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s ability to pursue its business strategies_**

The New Credit Facilities will include restrictive covenants and will require the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. The Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s ability to comply with ratios may be affected by events beyond its control. A breach of
any of these restrictive covenants or the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s failure to comply with the
required financial ratios could result in a default under the agreement governing its New Credit Facilities. If a
default occurs, the lenders under the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s New Credit Facilities may elect
to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and
payable, which would result in an event of default under the Notes. The lenders will also have the right in these
circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. If the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group is unable to repay certain borrowings when due, the lenders under its New Credit
Facilities will also have the right to claim against the collateral granted to them to secure the indebtedness. If the
payments under the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s New Credit Facilities and the Notes were to be
accelerated, it cannot assure you that its assets would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness, including
the Notes. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements”.

**_The Issuer is a finance company which will depend on payments under various intercompany loans to provide_**
**_it with funds to meet its obligations under the Notes and the Guarantors are holding companies without_**
**_independent operations_**

The Issuer is a wholly-owned finance company that conducts no business operations. It has limited assets, no
subsidiaries and a limited ability to generate revenues. Upon completion of the offering of the Notes, the only
significant assets of the Issuer will be various intercompany loans. The Issuer’s material liabilities will include
the Notes and the obligations under the New Credit Facilities and any additional debt it may incur under the
Indenture in the future, see “Description of Notes”. As such, the Issuer will be dependent upon payments from
other members of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group to make any payments due on the Notes. If these
other members of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group fail to make scheduled payments on these
intercompany loans, it is not expected that the Issuer will have any other sources of funds that would allow it to
make payments on its indebtedness. In addition, the Guarantors are holding companies that conduct no
independent business operations.

**_Each of the Notes and the Guarantees are subject to restrictions on enforcement_**

Unless the aggregate amount committed or funded under the secured debt of the Issuer and the Guarantors
(excluding debt represented by the Notes) represents less than 20% of the aggregate outstanding principal
amount of the total secured debt (including the Notes), except with the prior consent of or as required by more
than 66 [2]⁄3% of the senior creditors excluding the holders of the Notes, neither the trustee nor the holders of the
Notes may take enforcement action with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee unless and until:

    - an insolvency event in respect of the Issuer or a Guarantor is continuing, except that enforcement
action may only be taken in relation to that Issuer or Guarantor;

43


-----

    - an event of default as defined in the indenture is continuing and the security trustee has received a
notice of the relevant event of default specifying the circumstances of that event of default from the
trustee and a period of not less than 179 days has elapsed from the date that notice was given to the
security trustee;

    - any enforcement action is taken by creditors under the outstanding secured debt in respect of any Guarantor
or the Issuer, except that the trustee and the holders of the Notes may only take the same or equivalent
enforcement action as that taken by the relevant finance parties against such Guarantor or the Issuer;

    - an event of default in respect of non-payment on the Notes has occurred and is continuing in relation to
the non-payment in excess of US$500,000 (or its equivalent), following which the trustee and/or the
holders of the Notes may either take (i) action to demand payment, declare prematurely due and payable
or otherwise seek to accelerate payment of or place on demand all or any part of the Notes or demand for
payment under any Guarantee or (ii) any other Enforcement Action in respect of the unpaid sum only
(other than any action to petition for an insolvency event in relation to any member of the Group or any
other obligor), except to the extent such action is of the type set forth in the preceding clause (i)); or

    - on the originally scheduled maturity date, any amount owing under the relevant Notes has not been
repaid and remains outstanding.

See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Enforcement Action”.

**_Your rights to enforce remedies with respect to the collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees are_**
**_limited as long as any senior bank debt is outstanding_**

The Notes will be secured by the same collateral securing the New Credit Facilities. In addition, under the terms
of the indenture governing the Notes, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group will be permitted in the
future to incur additional indebtedness and other obligations that may share in the liens on the collateral securing
the Notes and the liens on the collateral securing its other senior secured credit facilities.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common security trustee, who will serve as the security trustee for
the secured parties under the New Credit Facilities and the Notes and will (subject to certain limited exceptions)
act with respect to such collateral only at the direction of the creditors with respect to the then outstanding
secured debt, other than holders of the Notes and any additional notes subject to the Intercreditor Agreement
(Additional Notes), (including creditors under the New Credit Facilities) until the aggregate amount committed
or funded under such secured debt is less than 20% of the aggregate principal amount of all committed or funded
secured debt (including the Notes and any Additional Notes) or until after the expiration of a 179-day
enforcement standstill. At any time in which the secured debt (other than debt under the Notes and any
Additional Notes) is less than 20% of the aggregate amount of secured debt, creditors holding 66 [2]⁄3% of the
aggregate amount of outstanding secured debt (including the Notes and any Additional Notes) will be able to
instruct the security trustee to enforce the security. In addition, after the expiration of the above referenced
standstill period, to the extent that the security trustee is not taking enforcement action, creditors holding 66 [2]⁄3%
of the total amount of outstanding secured debt (including the Notes and any Additional Notes) will be able to
instruct the security trustee to enforce the security. Until the expiration of the above referenced standstill period,
the creditors and the agent under the secured debt (other than the Notes and any Additional Notes) including the
creditors and agents under the New Credit Facilities will have (subject to certain limited exceptions) the
exclusive right to make all decisions with respect to the enforcement of remedies relating to such collateral. See
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”. As a result, the holders of the
Notes will not be able to force a sale of such collateral or otherwise independently pursue the remedies of a
secured creditor under the relevant security documents until the expiration of the applicable standstill period for
so long as any amounts under other senior debt remain outstanding in an amount greater than 20% of the
aggregate principal amount of total secured debt (including the Notes and any Additional Notes). The creditors
under other secured debt (including the New Credit Facilities) may have interests that are different from the
interests of holders of the Notes and they may not elect to pursue their remedies under the security documents at
a time when it would otherwise be advantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so.

In addition, if the Security Trustee sells the shares of Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s subsidiaries
that have been pledged as collateral through an enforcement of their security interest in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Guarantees and the liens over any other assets securing the Notes and
each Guarantee may be released. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement”. See “Description of Notes—Security”._

**_Your ability to recover under the share pledges constituting the collateral securing the Notes may be limited_**

Ratable first priority interests in the shares pledged as collateral have been granted for the benefit of creditors
under the New Credit Facilities and ratable first priority interests may be granted for the benefit of the creditors
of additional debt that may be incurred in the future.

The holders of obligations secured by the existing liens on the collateral will be entitled to receive proceeds from
any realisation of the collateral to repay their obligations in addition to the holders of the Notes. The Issuer
cannot assure you that, in the event of a sale or other disposition in connection with an enforcement action, the
proceeds from the sale of all of such collateral would be sufficient to satisfy the amounts outstanding under the
Notes and other obligations secured by first priority liens on the collateral. If the amount of proceeds recovered
from such a sale or other disposition is less than the aggregate amount of the obligations secured by such
collateral, the holders of Notes will not fully recover (if at all) under such collateral and the holders of the Notes
(to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the collateral) would have only an unsecured claim
against the remaining assets, which claim will rank equal in priority to the unsecured claims with respect to any
unsatisfied portion of the obligations owed by the Issuer and Guarantors under their other unsecured senior
indebtedness. As of 30 September 2009, on an adjusted basis giving effect to the issuance of the Notes and the
New Credit Facilities, no indebtedness would have been outstanding under the New Credit Facilities and US$500
million would have been available for additional borrowing under the New Credit Facilities. Under the indenture
governing the Notes, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group could also incur additional indebtedness
secured by first priority liens so long as such liens are securing indebtedness permitted to be incurred by the
covenants described under “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants” and certain other conditions are met. The
Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s ability to designate future debt as first priority secured, and to
enable the holders thereof to share in the collateral on a first priority basis with holders of the Notes and lenders
under its New Credit Facilities, may have the effect of diluting the ratio of the value of such collateral to the
aggregate amount of the obligations secured by the collateral.

No appraisals of any collateral have been prepared in connection with this offering. The value of the collateral at
any time will depend on market and other economic conditions, including the availability of suitable buyers. By
their nature, some or all of the collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value, and
its value to other parties may be less than its value to the pledgors. The Issuer cannot assure you that the fair
market value of the collateral as of the date of this offering memorandum exceeds the principal amount of the
debt secured thereby. The value of the assets pledged as collateral for the Notes may decline over time and could
be impaired in the future as a result of changing economic conditions, the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group’s failure to implement its business strategy, competition and other future trends, as well as by the
incurrence of additional debt secured by the collateral. The shares that constitute collateral are shares in holding
companies of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group and may also have limited value in the event of a
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceeding in relation to any operating company of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group because all of the obligations of the relevant operating company must be satisfied prior
to distribution to their respective equity holders. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of a
holding company may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale.

**_Your rights in the collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in collateral_**

Applicable law requires that a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected and its priority
retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party. The liens in the collateral securing the Notes
may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if the security trustee is not able to take the actions
necessary to perfect any of these liens on or prior to the date of the indenture governing the Notes. The Issuer and
the Guarantors have limited obligations to assist the security trustee in perfecting the noteholders’ security
interest in specified collateral. There can be no assurance that the trustee or the security trustee for the Notes will
monitor, or that the Cable & Wireless Communications Group will inform such trustee or security trustee of, the
future acquisition of property and rights that constitute collateral, and that the necessary action will be taken to
properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired collateral. The security trustee for the Notes has no
obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute collateral or the perfection of
any security interest. Such failure may result in the loss of the security interest in the collateral or the priority of
the security interest in favour of the Notes against third parties.

**_The Notes and each of the Guarantees will each be structurally subordinated to the liabilities and preference_**
**_shares (if any) of Cable & Wireless Group’s non-guarantor subsidiaries_**

As of the Issue Date, no operating companies will guarantee the Notes. Generally, claims of creditors of a
non-guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors and preference shareholders (if any), will have priority with

45


-----

respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiary over the claims of creditors of its parent entity, including
claims by noteholders under the Guarantees. In the event of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation,
reorganization, administration or other bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of any of the non-guarantor
subsidiaries, holders of their indebtedness and their trade creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their
claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to its parent
entity. As such, the Notes and each Guarantee will each be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including
trade creditors) and preference shareholders (if any) of the non-guarantor subsidiaries. At 30 September 2009, the
indebtedness of the non-guarantor subsidiaries of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group (other than the
unsecured Existing Bonds due 2019 issued by Cable & Wireless International Finance B.V. and guaranteed by
Cable and Wireless plc) was US$220 million. In addition, the Indenture will allow the non-guarantor subsidiaries
to incur more debt in the future.

**_Each Guarantee will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or_**
**_subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability_**

As of the Issue Date, each Guarantor will guarantee the payment of the Notes on a senior basis. Each Guarantee
will provide the relevant holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant Guarantor. However, the
Indenture will provide that each Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the
relevant Guarantor without rendering the relevant Guarantee voidable or otherwise ineffective under applicable
law and enforcement of each Guarantee would be subject to certain generally available defenses. These laws and
defenses include those that relate to corporate benefit, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, financial assistance,
corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally.

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other laws,
a court could subordinate or void the Guarantees and, if payment had already been made under a Guarantee,
require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant Guarantor, if the court found that:

    - the relevant Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or
shareholders of the Guarantor or, in certain jurisdictions, even when the recipient was simply aware
that the Guarantor was insolvent when it granted the relevant Guarantee;

    - the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for the relevant Guarantee
and the Guarantor was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Guarantee;
(ii) undercapitalised or became undercapitalised because of the relevant Guarantee; or (iii) intended to
incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity;

    - the relevant Guarantee were held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or not to be in the
best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor; or

    - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee was in excess of the maximum amount
permitted under applicable law.

The measure of insolvency for purposes of insolvency or bankruptcy challenges varies depending on the law
applied. For example, generally, a company incorporated in the UK or the Cayman Islands would be considered
insolvent if it is demonstrated that it was unable to pay its debts as they become due. If a court decided that either a
Guarantee was a fraudulent conveyance and voided such Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason,
you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer
and, if applicable, of the other Guarantor under the relevant Guarantee which has not been declared void.

**_The insolvency laws to which the Issuer and Guarantors are subject pose certain risks for holders of the Notes_**

The Issuer is registered in the Cayman Islands as a limited company and is therefore subject to the insolvency
laws of the Cayman Islands. Under the insolvency laws of the Cayman Islands, a transaction entered into by a
Cayman company may be invalid or voidable in certain circumstances. Similarly, the Guarantors are all
incorporated in England, maintain their registered offices and conduct the administration of their respective
interests on a regular basis in England and Wales. On the basis of those factors, an English court would be likely
to conclude those entities have their “centre of main interests” (CoMI) in England, within the meaning of
Council Regulation (EC) No 1346/2000 of 29 May 2000 on Insolvency Proceedings (the EU Insolvency
**Regulation), and therefore determine that those entities are eligible to commence insolvency proceedings in**
England that would constitute “main insolvency proceedings” under article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency
Regulation. English law would apply to such main insolvency proceedings, subject to particular exceptions set
out in the EU Insolvency Regulation. Under English insolvency law, a transaction entered into by an English
company may also be invalid or voidable in certain circumstances (described below).

46


-----

Under the insolvency law of the Cayman Islands, if a company formed and registered in the Cayman Islands
enters into a transaction at a time when it was unable to pay its debts (as defined in section 93 of the Companies
Law (2009 Revision) of the Cayman Islands) with a view to giving a creditor of the company a preference over
the other creditors of the company, that transaction is invalid if liquidation proceedings are commenced against
the company within 6 months of that transaction. In addition, any disposition of property made by a company for
no consideration (or for a consideration worth significantly less than the value of the property subject to that
disposition) with the intent to defraud its creditors (which is defined as “an intention wilfully to defeat an
obligation owed to a creditor”) is voidable at the instance of the liquidator or a creditor of the company. A
liquidator or creditor of the company must bring such an action within 6 years of the relevant disposition. The
Issuer believes that the Issuer’s entry into the transactions contemplated by this offering memorandum
(including, without limitation, the issue of the Notes) will not amount to giving a creditor of the Issuer a
preference over the other creditors of the Issuer and is not made with an intention to defraud its creditors.
However, there can be no assurance that the issuance of the Notes will not be challenged or that a court would
support the Issuer’s analysis.

The insolvency laws of the Cayman Islands empower the courts of the Cayman Islands to appoint a provisional
liquidator of a company on an ex parte application by the company if the company is, or is likely to become,
unable to pay its debts (as defined in section 93 of the Companies Law (2009 Revision) of the Cayman Islands)
and the company intends to present a compromise or arrangement to its creditors. A provisional liquidator may
also be appointed if there are prima facie grounds for the making of a winding up order and the appointment of a
provisional liquidator is necessary in order to prevent the dissipation or misuse of the company’s assets, the
oppression of minority shareholders or misconduct or mismanagement by the company’s directors. Once a
provisional liquidator has been appointed, no suit or action can be continued or commenced against the company
except with the leave of the court. If a provisional liquidator were to be appointed over the Issuer, the Cayman
courts may not allow enforcement of the Notes while the provisional liquidator is in office.

Under the insolvency laws of the Cayman Islands, certain preferential claims against a company, including
certain sums payable to, and in respect of, employees of the company, annual fees due to the Government of the
Cayman Islands from the company and all expenses properly incurred in the winding up of the company may,
while ranking behind the claims of holders of fixed security granted by the company, rank ahead of other
creditors of the company.

Under the insolvency laws of the Cayman Islands, once compulsory insolvency proceedings are commenced
against a company (which lead to a winding up order being made against the company) any transfer of shares in
the company, or alteration in the status of the company’s members made after commencement of those
insolvency proceedings, is void unless the court otherwise orders. In addition, once voluntary insolvency
proceedings are commenced against a company, any transfer of shares in the company not sanctioned by the
liquidator of the company, and any alteration in the status of the company’s members, is void. These provisions
may restrict any ability to enforce the pledge over the shares in the Issuer.

As set out above, and for the reasons set out above, English insolvency laws would be likely to apply to the
Guarantors. Under English insolvency law, the liquidator or administrator of a company may, among other
things, apply to the court to unwind a transaction entered into by such company, if such company was unable to
pay its debts (as defined in section 123 of the Insolvency Act) at the time of, or as a result of, the transaction and
enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within two years of the completion of the transaction. A
transaction might be subject to a challenge if it was entered into by a company “at an undervalue”, that is, it
involved a gift by the company or the company received consideration of “significantly less” value than the
benefit given by such company. However, a court generally will not intervene if a company entered into the
transaction in good faith for the purpose of carrying on its business and at the time it did so there were reasonable
grounds for believing the transaction would benefit such company.

Accordingly, under English insolvency law a liquidator or administrator of one of the Guarantors could apply to
the court to unwind the issuance of its guarantee if such liquidator or administrator believed that issuance of such
guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue. The Issuer believes that each guarantee will not be provided
by the Guarantors in a transaction at an undervalue and that each guarantee will be provided in good faith for the
purposes of carrying on the business of the relevant Guarantor and its subsidiaries and that there are reasonable
grounds for believing that the transactions will benefit each such subsidiary Guarantor. However, there can be no
assurance that the provision of the Guarantees will not be challenged by a liquidator or administrator or that a
court would support the Issuer’s analysis.

47


-----

If the liquidator or administrator can show that a Guarantors has given “preference” to any person within six
months of the onset of liquidation or administration of such company (or two years if the preference is to a
“connected person”) and, at the time of the preference, such Guarantor was technically insolvent or became so as
a result of the preferential transaction, then a court has the power under English insolvency law to, among other
things, void the preferential transaction. For these purposes, a company gives preference to a person if that
person is one of the company’s creditors (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities)
and the company does anything or suffers anything to be done which has the effect of putting that person into a
position which, in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation, will be better than the position that
person would have been in if that thing had not been done. The court may not make an order avoiding a
preferential transaction unless it is satisfied that the company was influenced by a desire to put that person in a
better position. This provision of English insolvency law may affect transactions entered into or payments made
by any of the Guarantors during the period prior to its liquidation or administration.

In addition, if it can be shown that a transaction entered into by an English company was made for less than fair
value and was made to shield assets from creditors, then the transaction may be set aside under English
insolvency law as a transaction defrauding creditors. Any person who is a “victim” of the transaction, and not
just liquidators or administrators, may assert such a claim (although the application to the court would in the first
instance be made by the relevant officeholder). There is no statutory time limit within which a claim must be
made, and the company need not be insolvent at the time of the transaction.

The relevant English insolvency statutes empower English courts to make an administration order in respect of a
company with its CoMI in England. An administration order can be made if the court is satisfied that the relevant
company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” and that the administration order is reasonably likely
to achieve the purpose of administration. In addition, the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” over the assets
of a company with its CoMI in England may appoint an administrator out of court, provided such floating charge
has become enforceable and the company need not necessarily be insolvent. In this case the prospective
administrator must be satisfied that the purpose of administration is reasonably likely to be achieved. A company
with its CoMI in England or the directors of such company may also appoint an administrator out of court,
although the company must be unable to pay its debts at the time of such appointment. The purpose of an
administration is comprised of three parts which must be looked at successively: rescuing the company as a
going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as a
whole or, if neither of those objectives are reasonably practicable, and the interests of the creditors as a whole are
not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realising property to make a distribution to secured or preferred creditors.

The rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are particularly curtailed in an administration. During the
administration, no proceedings or other legal process may be commenced or continued against the debtor, except
with leave of the court or consent of the administrator. In particular, upon the appointment of an administrator,
no step may be taken to enforce security over the company’s property, except with the consent of the
administrator or the leave of the court. If a Guarantor were to enter into administration proceedings, the
guarantees and the related security from the Guarantor could not be enforced while the relevant company was in
administration without the leave of the Court or the consent of the administrator.

In addition, an administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business and, subject to certain requirements
under the Insolvency Act 1986, dispose of the property of a company in administration.

However, the general prohibition against enforcement by secured creditors without consent of the administrator
or leave of the Court, and the administrators’ powers with respect to floating and other security, do not apply to
any security interest created or arising under a financial collateral arrangement within the meaning of the
Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (UK). A financial collateral arrangement includes
(subject to certain other conditions) a pledge over shares in a company, where both the collateral provider and
collateral taker are non-natural persons.

Under English insolvency law, any interest accruing under or in respect of the Notes for any period from the date
of commencement of administration or liquidation proceedings, to the extent not fully covered by the assets
securing the Notes, could be recovered by holders of the Notes only from any surplus remaining after payment of
all other debts proven in the administration or liquidation.

Certain preferential claims, including unpaid contributions to occupational pension schemes in respect of the
twelve month period prior to insolvency, and unpaid employees’ remuneration in respect of the four month
period prior to insolvency, will, while ranking behind the claims of holders of fixed security, rank ahead of

48


-----

floating charges under English insolvency law. In addition, a prescribed part of floating charge realisations
(being 50% of the first £10,000 of net realisations and 20% of the net realisations hereafter, up to a maximum of
£600,000) is required to be set aside for the benefit of unsecured creditors and, as such, ranks ahead of the
relevant floating charge.

**_The Issuer may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance the change of control offer_**
**_required by the indenture governing the Notes_**

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control, the Issuer will be required to offer to
repurchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase price of 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase. However, it is possible that the Issuer will not have sufficient
funds at the time of the change of control to make the required repurchase of Notes. In addition, the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group may require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes
upon a change of control. The Issuer may not be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer
to purchase Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under
the New Credit Facilities and certain financing arrangements. See “Description of Notes—Repurchase at the
_Option of Holders—Change of Control”._

The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event
of certain important corporate events, including a reorganisation, restructuring, merger or other similar
transaction involving the Cable & Wireless Communications Group that may adversely affect you, because such
corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not
constitute a “Change of Control” as defined in the Indenture. Except as described under “Description of Notes—
_Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control,” the Indenture will not contain provisions that would_
require them to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger,
recapitalisation or similar transaction.

The definition of “Change of Control” in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially all of the
assets of Cable and Wireless plc (or, after the Demerger, Cable & Wireless Communications Plc) and its
restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting
the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction
would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of Cable and Wireless plc (or, after the
Demerger, Cable & Wireless Communications) and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it
may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an
offer to repurchase the Notes. See “Description of Notes”.

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be_**
**_limited_**

The Issuer cannot assure you as to:

    - the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

    - your ability to sell your Notes; or

    - the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing
interest rates, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s operating results and the market for similar
securities. Historically, the market for non investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have
caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for
the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to
disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The trading market for the Notes may attract different investors
and this may affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be
subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on holders of the Notes, regardless of the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s prospects and financial performance. As a result, there is no
assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may
not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all.

Although an application has been made for the Notes to be listed for trading on the London Stock Exchange, the
Issuer cannot assure you that the Notes will become or remain listed. Although no assurance is made as to the
liquidity the Notes as a result of the admission to trading on the London Stock Exchange, failure to be approved

49


-----

for listing or the delisting of the Notes, as applicable, from the London Stock Exchange may have a material
effect on a holder’s ability to resell the Notes, as applicable in the secondary market.

In addition, the Indenture will allow the Issuer to issue additional notes in the future, which could adversely
impact the liquidity of the Notes.

**_The transfer of the Notes is restricted, which may adversely affect their liquidity and the price at which they_**
**_may be sold_**

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been registered under, and the Issuer is not obliged to register the Notes
or the Guarantees under, the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and, unless so
registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or a transaction not subject to, the
registration requirements of the Securities Act and any other applicable laws. See “Notice to US Investors”. The
Issuer has not agreed to or otherwise undertaken to register the Notes, and the Issuer has no intention to do so.
The Notes may only be transferred to people outside the United States in offshore transactions pursuant to
Regulation S or to qualified institutional buyers within the United States in reliance on Rule 144A of the
Securities Act.

**_The Notes may be issued with original issue discount for US federal income tax purposes_**

The Notes may be issued with original issue discount (OID) for US federal income tax purposes. If the Notes are
issued with more than de minimis original issue discount, in addition to the stated interest on the notes, US
Holders (as defined under “Tax Considerations—US Taxation”) of Notes issued with OID will be required to
include the amounts representing the OID in gross income (as ordinary income) generally on a constant yield
basis in advance of receipt of the cash payments to which such income is attributable, regardless of the US
Holder’s regular method of accounting for US federal income tax purposes. For a discussion of certain material
tax consequences of an investment in the notes, see “Tax Considerations—US Taxation”.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The US$500 million proceeds of the offering, less fees and expenses of approximately US$12 million, will be
used to repay drawings under the revolving portion of the New Credit Facilities (the New Credit Facilities
comprise a US$400 million revolving credit facility and a US$100 million term loan), to fund working capital
needs and for general corporate purposes.

(1) On 29 January 2010, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s previously existing US$415 million
credit facility (carrying value of US$410 million and US$5 million of capitalised fees in each case as of
30 September 2009) was repaid with drawings under the revolving portion of the New Credit Facilities and
cash on hand and cancelled; the revolving portion of the New Credit Facilities will be repaid with an
equivalent amount of proceeds from this offering, following which no amounts will be outstanding under
the New Credit Facilities.

At Demerger, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group is expected to have net debt representing
approximately 0.8 times, on a consolidated basis, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s 2009/10
EBITDA (excluding exceptional items) guidance of US$880 – US$900 million and approximately 1.2 times on a
proportionate ownership basis. This guidance does not include US$42 million of estimated Central operations
costs. The total amount of new and replacement Demerger financing for the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group will be US$1 billion. As at 30 September 2009 adjusted for the Financing, the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group would have had available liquidity of approximately US$1 billion (comprising the
undrawn US$500 million New Credit Facilities and US$510 million cash and cash equivalents).

**CAPITALISATION**
The following table sets out the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s cash and cash equivalents and the

(1) This capitalisation table reflects the capitalisation of Cable & Wireless Communication Group and
adjustments made thereto. In the event that the Demerger does not occur, the capitalisation of the Cable &
Wireless Group (including the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group) would be substantially different. As of
30 September 2009 on an adjusted basis to take into account the new Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group
facilities and the issuance of the Convertible Bond and the transfer of the Convertible Bond obligations and
proceeds related thereto at Demerger, Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group would have had cash and cash
equivalents of US$239 million, current debt of US$30 million, non-current debt of US$195 million under its
credit facilities and other obligations and a US$319 million obligation with respect to the Convertible Bond
(on an IFRS basis).
(2) Represents the additional estimated net surplus proceeds from the offering of the Notes, after giving effect
to the use of proceeds as shown in this Adjustments column.
(3) Represents the current portion of the previously existing US$415 million credit facility (carrying value of
US$410 million and US$5 million of capitalised fees) repaid with drawings under the revolving portion of
the New Credit Facilities and cash on hand; the revolving portion of the New Credit Facilities will be repaid
with an equivalent amount of proceeds from this offering.
(4) Represents the non-current portion of the previously existing US$415 million credit facility (carrying value
of US$410 million and US$5 million of capitalised fees) repaid with drawings under the revolving portion
of the New Credit Facilities and cash on hand; the revolving portion of the New Credit Facilities will be
repaid with an equivalent amount of proceeds from this offering.
(5) Represents the offering of the US$500 million Notes as presented under IFRS on the balance sheet, in which
indebtedness is stated as net proceeds received (i.e., including any premium or discount and after deducting
estimated net issuance costs of US$12 million).

(1) EBITDA has been calculated as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, LTIP charge, net
other operating income/expenses and exceptional items. EBITDA is a supplemental measure of Cable &
Wireless Communications Group’s performance that is not required by or presented in accordance with IFRS.
EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to IFRS measures, such as profit before income tax and
profit for the period or any other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS. The Cable &
Wireless Communications Group uses EBITDA to facilitate operating performance comparisons and because
it believes it is frequently used by securities analysts. EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and
prospective purchasers should not consider it in isolation from, or as a substitute analysis for, Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s results of operations. Other companies may define EBITDA differently and, as a
result, Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s measure of EBITDA may not be directly comparable to the
EBITDA of other companies. EBITDA is presented herein including costs attributable to the Central
operations for the relevant period. Historically, Cable and Wireless plc has reported EBITDA for its CWI
business excluding such costs. Accordingly, the financial information and guidance presented in “Cable &
_Wireless Communications Operating and Financial Review—Financial Guidance for 2009/2010” is shown_
excluding costs attributable to the Central operations. Costs of Central operations included in the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group’s EBITDA (excluding exceptional items) presented herein were £22 million
(US$41 million), £28 million (US$56 million) and £28 million (US$50 million) for the years ended 31 March
2007, 31 March 2008 and 31 March 2009 respectively.

(2) EBITDA margin is calculated as EBITDA (excluding exceptional items) divided by revenue.

(3) Trading cash flow has been calculated as net cash flow before financing, acquisitions and disposals and top-up
contributions to the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund. Trading cash flow is a supplemental measure of
Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s performance and liquidity that is not required by or presented in
accordance with IFRS. Trading cash flow should not be considered as an alternative to IFRS measures. The
Cable & Wireless Communications Group uses trading cash flow to facilitate operating performance
comparisons and because it believes it is frequently used by securities analysts. Trading cash flow has
limitations as an analytical tool, and prospective purchasers should not consider it in isolation from, or as a
substitute analysis for, Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s results of operations. Other companies
may define trading cash flow differently and, as a result, Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s measure
of trading cash flow may not be directly comparable to the trading cash flow of other companies.

**OVERVIEW OF THE CABLE & WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS GROUP**

**Introduction**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group (formerly known as Cable & Wireless International (CWI)),
headquartered in London, England, owns and operates full-service telecommunications businesses providing
mobile, broadband and domestic and international fixed line services to consumers, small and medium-sized
enterprises, corporate customers (including other carriers) and governments. The Cable & Wireless
Communications Group is the market leading telecommunications provider in the majority of its markets. The
business is managed as four regional operations—the Caribbean, Panama, Macau and Monaco & Islands each of

58


-----

which is profitable and cash generative in its own right. These four regional operations span 38 countries through
33 subsidiaries and five joint ventures, with Panama, Macau, Jamaica, the Maldives and Monaco being the main
markets by revenue. The ownership of these businesses varies—some are wholly owned and others are partly
owned with either public, government or corporate partners.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group is the only full service telecommunications provider in the majority
of its markets. It is the market leader in 19 out of 27 mobile markets in which it competes, 25 out of 34 broadband
markets in which it competes and 25 out of 27 fixed line markets in which it competes. As at 30 September 2009,
the Cable & Wireless Communications Group, through its subsidiaries and joint ventures, provided services to
approximately 8.3 million mobile, 0.6 million broadband and 1.8 million fixed line customers.

Since April 2006, the Cable & Wireless Group has been separated internally into two principal business units, the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group and the Cable & Wireless Communications Group, supported by the Central
operations. The Central operations have provided corporate services such as treasury, remuneration, pensions,
company secretarial, insurance, legal, external affairs and corporate finance to each of the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group and Cable & Wireless Communications Group. For the purposes of “Historical Financial
_Information of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group”, the results of the Central operations are combined_
with the Cable & Wireless Communications Group. In the year ended 31 March 2009, the Central operations
generated an EBITDA loss of £28 million (US$50 million) and employed an average of 85 staff.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s total revenue for the year ended 31 March 2009 was US$2,447
million. Including the costs of Central, Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s total EBITDA (excluding
exceptional items) for the year ended 31 March 2009 was US$871 million. Profit before income tax for the year
ended 31 March 2009 was US$394 million. At 31 March 2009, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group
had 8.7 million mobile customers, 0.6 million broadband customers and 1.8 million fixed line customers and for
the year ended 31 March 2009, employed an average of 7,303 employees.

**Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s principal activities**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group has four principal revenue streams, all of which are provided in
the majority of its markets—mobile, broadband, fixed line and enterprise, data and other.

**_Mobile: The Cable & Wireless Communications Group operates GSM networks in 27 markets and is the market_**
leader in 19 markets. In addition, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group operates UMTS and WiMax
(Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) networks in a number of markets. In the year ended
31 March 2009, mobile contributed US$907 million, or 37%, to Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s
total revenue. At 31 March 2009, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group had 4.1 million active GSM
mobile customers in its subsidiaries and a further 4.5 million in its joint ventures. The Cable & Wireless
Communications Group offers both prepaid and post-paid services in the majority of its mobile markets,
however, the mix of each varies greatly from market to market depending on local economic conditions and
customer demand. For example, in terms of revenue generated, prepaid services are dominant in Jamaica and
Panama while post-paid services are dominant in Macau and Monaco.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group derives its mobile revenue from both retail and wholesale
streams. Retail revenue is derived from billing customers for the provision of services such as: calls including
domestic, international direct dial and those made while overseas (outbound roaming); value added services such
as SMS, mobile Internet, and push email; handsets and equipment; and inbound roaming, which arises when a
foreign customer generates a call domestically using the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s network.
Connection fees may be charged for each call. Generally, calls are charged by usage, the units for which vary
from market to market, however the industry trend is for unlimited use packages, where services are charged
pursuant to a fixed monthly fee.

Wholesale revenue is largely made up of interconnect revenue, which arises when customers of other mobile
operators make a call that terminates on, or transfers over, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group
network. It also includes items such as the sale of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s mobile
network capacity to other mobile operators; wholesaling of mobile equipment, such as handsets; and charges for
bulk SMS broadcasting.

**_Fixed line: Of its 27 fixed line markets, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group is the market leader in 25_**
of these. Fixed line is a traditional service provided over a legacy network and in recent years it has faced the
challenge of substitution by newer services such as mobile and broadband. As a result, the Cable & Wireless

59


-----

Communications Group’s fixed line voice revenue has declined as mobile and broadband have grown. In the year
ended 31 March 2009, fixed line services contributed US$764 million, or 31%, to Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s total revenue. At 31 March 2009, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group had
1.5 million fixed line connections in its subsidiaries and a further 0.3 million in its joint ventures.

Fixed line revenue is categorised into two principal revenue streams—domestic voice and international voice.

Domestic voice revenue includes: calls made from a Cable & Wireless Communications Group fixed line which
terminate domestically; installation and disconnection charges; line rental; voicemail and other value added
services such as call waiting; directory services; wholesale services such as the resale of minutes or toll free
numbers, co-location fees like pole sharing; equipment revenue and domestic interconnect revenue. Interconnect
revenues arise from charges to third-party carriers for carrying and terminating their traffic on the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group’s network.

International voice revenue includes: outbound international direct dialled (IDD) calls made from a Cable &
Wireless Communications Group fixed line; wholesale carrier services; outgoing IDD calls sold wholesale to
service suppliers, such as international toll free numbers; international calling cards; and international
interconnect revenue for the delivery of other carriers’ calls over the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s
network.

A connection fee may be charged for fixed line calls and/or by usage, the units for which vary from market to
market.

**_Enterprise, data and other: Enterprise, data and other revenue includes revenue from the provision of corporate_**
telecommunications solutions, international traffic management contracts, leased circuits, legacy data services
such as dial-up Internet, Internet hosting, directory services, wholesale data services, equipment rentals and cable
television services. For example, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s Panama business has a well
developed enterprise proposition and currently operates the 911 emergency services call platform and other
similar services for government bodies. In the year ended 31 March 2009, enterprise, data and other contributed
US$577 million of revenue representing 24% of revenue.

**_Broadband: The Cable & Wireless Communications Group provides broadband services in 34 markets and is the_**
market leader in 25 of these. In the year ended 31 March 2009, broadband contributed US$199 million, or 8%, to
Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s total revenue. At 31 March 2009, the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group had 0.5 million broadband customers in its subsidiaries and a further 0.1 million in its
joint ventures.

Generally, broadband services are billed as packages that offer download and service speed limits for a monthly
fee—the higher the download limits and service speeds, the higher the monthly fee. The type and variety of
packages offered varies across the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business and are tailored to the
needs of each market.

**Cable & Wireless Communications Group geographic operations**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group operates in 38 markets through four regional operations—the
Caribbean, Panama, Macau and Monaco & Islands—with a small London head office providing financial and
strategic support. For a breakdown of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s economic interests in its
operations in various countries, see the section entitled “Cable & Wireless Communications Group Business—
_Geographic Operations”._

**_Caribbean: The Caribbean operation covers 14 countries through 13 subsidiaries and one joint venture. For_**
the year ended 31 March 2009, the Caribbean (excluding the Trinidad and Tobago joint venture) contributed
US$975 million in revenue and US$337 million in EBITDA before exceptional items. These, respectively,
represent 40% and 39% of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s total revenue and EBITDA
before exceptional items. At 31 March 2009, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s Caribbean
subsidiaries (excluding the Trinidad and Tobago joint venture) had 1.3 million active GSM mobile
customers, 0.2 million broadband customers and 0.7 million fixed line connections. The Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s Caribbean joint venture in Trinidad and Tobago, has 0.9 million active GSM
mobile customers, 0.1 million broadband customers and 0.3 million fixed line connections at the same date.
For the year ended 31 March 2009, the Caribbean operation (excluding the Trinidad and Tobago joint
venture) employed an average of 3,196 employees.

**_Panama: For the year ended 31 March 2009, Panama contributed US$667 million in revenue and US$276_**
million in EBITDA before exceptional items. These, respectively, represent 27% and 32% of the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group’s total revenue and EBITDA before exceptional items. At 31 March 2009,
Panama had 2.3 million active GSM mobile customers, 0.1 million broadband customers and 0.4 million
fixed line connections. For the year ended 31 March 2009, Panama employed an average of 1,900
employees.

**_Macau: For the year ended 31 March 2009, Macau contributed US$302 million in revenue and US$139_**
million in EBITDA before exceptional items. These, respectively, represent 12% and 16% of the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group’s total revenue and EBITDA before exceptional items. At 31 March 2009,
Macau had 0.4 million active mobile customers, 0.1 million broadband customers and 0.2 million fixed line
connections. For the year ended 31 March 2009, Macau employed an average of 903 employees.

**_Monaco & Islands: The Monaco & Islands operation covers 22 countries through subsidiaries and joint_**
ventures. For the year ended 31 March 2009, Monaco & Islands contributed US$506 million in revenue and
US$137 million in EBITDA before exceptional items. These, respectively, represent 21% and 16% of the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s total revenue and EBITDA before exceptional items. At
31 March 2009, the joint ventures of Monaco & Islands had 3.7 million mobile customers, 14,000
broadband customers and 48,000 fixed line connections. In its subsidiaries at the same date, Monaco &
Islands had 0.2 million active GSM mobile customers, 32,000 broadband customers and 0.2 million fixed
line connections. For the year ended 31 March 2009, Monaco & Islands employed an average of 1,106
employees in its subsidiaries.

**PRINCIPAL FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**

The following section contains a description of the key drivers of the results of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group, both in general and those issues specific to the periods under review.

**Demand drivers**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group provides a full range of telecommunications services in the
majority of its markets to retail customers, small and medium-sized enterprises and corporate (including carriers)
and government customers. The key drivers of demand for products and services are generally consistent across
the business.

**_Technological development: The telecommunications industry is characterised by technological advances and_**
the frequent introduction of new services and products. This drives demand for new products and services, and
churn from other products and services, for example, the fixed to mobile and broadband substitution that has
materially changed Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s revenue mix in recent years. The most
significant recent advancements in telecommunications technology that have affected the results of the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group in the period under review are the introduction of new mobile technologies and
the growth of broadband. Television and entertainment are expected to become increasingly important segments
to the Cable & Wireless Communications Group during the coming years with Panama having launched a
pay-TV business in December 2009 and a roll-out being planned in other countries.

In the year ended 31 March 2009, 31% of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s total revenue came
from fixed line voice services and 45% from mobile and broadband, compared with 39% from fixed line and
39% from mobile and broadband in the year ended 31 March 2007.

**_Economic conditions: The markets in which the Cable & Wireless Communications Group operates are at_**
various stages of economic development, and economic growth rates vary widely from market to market. The
recent global downturn had an impact in all of its markets, but most significantly in the Caribbean, Seychelles,
the Maldives and, to a lesser extent, Macau. The decrease in tourists in the regions exacerbated the effect of the
downturn on these mostly tourism dependant economies. Changes in the economic conditions of its markets not
only affect the total demand for its services but the types of services demanded during a downturn with, in
particular, international voice and roaming services being adversely affected.

**_Market penetration: Market penetration measures the total number of customers in each market as a proportion_**
of the addressable market, and can therefore be an indicator of future growth potential and desirability of the
market to both the Cable & Wireless Communications Group and other market participants. In the periods under

61


-----

review, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group has focused its investment in part on increasing its
network coverage and as a result, has contributed to growing the size of its mobile and broadband markets, at the
same time growing its mobile and broadband revenue. Some of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s
markets, for example Panama, still have relatively low broadband penetration rates, offering further growth
opportunity.

**Cost drivers**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group has three general categories of costs—those which are directly
related to the generation of revenue (cost of sales), operating costs and exceptional restructuring costs.

**_Cost of sales accounts for those costs that are either variable in line with changes in revenue or can be directly_**
attributable to a single customer. A major item in the cost of sales of the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group is the cost that arises when a Cable & Wireless Communications Group customer makes a call which
transfers over or terminates on another operator’s network, either fixed or wireless. The other network operator
charges the Cable & Wireless Communications Group for this service, and these charges are generally referred to
as outpayments. These outpayments are based on usage and charges are regulated. Cost of sales also includes
items such as the cost of mobile handsets and subsidies, equipment to be installed in a single customer’s
premises, the cost of a dedicated network to a single customer’s premises, and payments to third parties for
distribution of products such as prepaid mobile credit vouchers.

**_Operating costs are those costs that are not directly variable in line with changes in revenue, and cannot be_**
directly attributed to a single customer. These include costs such as the salaries and wages of employees, licence
and operating arrangement fees, network maintenance and support fees, equipment support fees and costs, rental
on property, sales and marketing costs, travel, consultancy fees and utilities.

**_Exceptional restructuring costs are costs associated with the transformation activities that the Cable & Wireless_**
Communications Group has undertaken in the period under review to drive improved business performance and
reduce operating costs. They include the cost of regional programmes which have focused largely on the
Caribbean including headcount management programmes. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group
recorded restructuring charges of US$33 million and US$87 million for the years ended 31 March 2008 and 2009
respectively (see section entitled “—Transformation” for transformation initiatives).

**Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)**

The LTIP was introduced on 1 April 2006 for the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s most senior
managers. For more details on the LTIP and its calculation see “Information on the Issuer, the Subsidiary
_Guarantors, Cable and Wireless plc and Cable & Wireless Communications—The Cable & Wireless Long Term_
_Incentive Plan (LTIP)”._

Members of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group senior management team have waived their right to
immediate vesting of their Cable & Wireless Communications-related LTIP awards on Demerger so that those
awards can continue until 31 March 2011.

The LTIP is accounted for in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits. The amount accrued as a liability at
each reporting date represents the estimated time pro-rated present value of the obligation. This requires
estimates of the valuation of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group to determine the obligation and
requires the use of a number of assumptions which, by their nature, are subjective and subject to fluctuation. The
income statement charge for each period reflects the movement in the amount accrued in the period. For the
periods under review the income statement charge for the LTIP was US$19 million for the year ended 31 March
2007, US$16 million for the year ended 31 March 2008, nil for the year ended 31 March 2009 and US$11
million for the six months ended 30 September 2009.

**Acquisitions and disposals**

In the periods under review and subsequent, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s organic growth
strategy has been complemented by the acquisition of assets that have enhanced its business, and the disposal of
assets that were no longer aligned with its overall strategy or where the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group could not see a path to achieving management control of the business.

62


-----

In January 2007, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group disposed of its 20% stake in its associate in
Bahrain, Batelco, for net proceeds of US$481 million. The profit on disposal was US$288 million. In the year
ended 31 March 2006, Batelco contributed US$47 million to the results of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group.

On 21 September 2007, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group purchased an additional 17% shareholding
in Cable & Wireless St Kitts and Nevis Limited for cash consideration of US$14 million. The shares were
previously held by the government of the Federation of St Kitts and Nevis (the Federation). As a result of the
acquisition, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s effective interest in Cable & Wireless St Kitts and
Nevis Limited was increased from 65% to 82%. As part of the purchase agreement with the government, the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group committed to offer 5% of the shares acquired to residents of the
Federation which were subscribed in full, reducing the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s effective
interest to 77%.

In January 2008, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s subsidiary in Monaco purchased a 49% stake in
the Connecteo Group and gained management control of the holding company for cash consideration of US$14
million. In January 2009, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group paid US$8 million for a further 16%
interest. The Connecteo Group provides satellite, data and Internet services via VSAT (Very Small Aperture
Terminals) and WLL (Wireless Local Loops) in Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Guinea, Niger and Senegal.

In October 2009, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group purchased a further 7% stake in Dhiraagu from
the Maldives government for US$40 million, bringing its total stake in Dhiraagu to 52%. In the Maldives,
Dhiraagu is the exclusive provider of fixed line and broadband services.

In November 2009, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group increased its stake in Divona Algerie, a
telecommunications operator providing broadband services in Algeria, to almost 100% for US$1 million.

**Exchange rates**

Due to the nature and geographic diversity of its business, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group is
exposed to foreign exchange risk. In the year ended 31 March 2009, approximately 75% of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s EBITDA was generated in US dollar denominated, pegged or linked currencies, while
approximately 25% was generated mainly in Jamaican dollars, euros, sterling and, to a lesser extent the
Seychelles rupee.

The reported profits of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group are translated in accordance with Adopted
IFRS at average rates of exchange prevailing during each period. In the year ended 31 March 2009, the impact of
changes in exchange rates based on the prior year results translated at current exchange rates decreased EBITDA
by approximately US$5 million.

**Transformation**

For the period under review, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group has undertaken transformation
initiatives to drive improved business performance and reduce costs. During the periods under review, three key
transformation activities occurred:

    - the separation of the Cable & Wireless Group into two standalone businesses, the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group, and the reshaping of the Central
operations of the Cable & Wireless Group, which will be part of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group from the Scheme Effective Time;

    - a programme focused on streamlining the Cable & Wireless Communications Group London head
office; and

    - reducing the cost base in the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s Caribbean business, the “One
Caribbean” transformation programme.

**Impairment of assets**

In the year ended 31 March 2009, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group did not impair any assets.

In the year ended 31 March 2008, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group recorded a US$74 million write
down of assets in its Jamaican business as part of its year end review of asset carrying values. This impairment
related to the Jamaican business’ mobile network assets and reflected the poor recent trading performance of the
business and additional competition in the mobile market.

In the year ended 31 March 2007, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group recorded a US$55 million write
down of its joint venture operation, TSTT, in the Caribbean operation. This impairment reflected the poor trading
performance in the year following the introduction of competition in the year ended 31 March 2006. Neither of
these asset write downs impacted cash flow.

**Legacy issues**

In June 2003, Cable and Wireless plc announced that it planned to withdraw from the US domestic market and
on 8 December 2003, Cable & Wireless America (CWA) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection under the
US Bankruptcy Code. As of 8 December 2003, the CWA entities were deconsolidated from the Cable & Wireless
Group. As a result of this transaction, Cable and Wireless plc made a change to its income statement to cover
risks and costs associated with the exit from the US. As these issues have been addressed, unused provisions and
accruals have been released as results from discontinued operations in the income statement of Cable & Wireless
Communications. In the years ended 31 March 2007, 31 March 2008 and 31 March 2009, these releases
amounted to US$53 million, US$4 million and US$7 million. At 31 March 2009, provision had been fully
released in respect of the exit from the US. On 18 December 2009, the final decree in respect of the Chapter 11
proceedings was made and the proceedings closed.

Pender Insurance Limited (Pender) was Cable and Wireless plc’s Isle of Man domiciled captive insurance
company which ceased to underwrite any new business from April 2003. Pender purchased reinsurance for many
of the risks it underwrote and remains liable for all policies it underwrote in the first instance, notwithstanding
the reinsurances. In 2003, certain of Pender’s reinsurers instituted proceedings seeking a declaration that they
were entitled to avoid some of their reinsurance obligations and as a result, certain accruals and provisions were
booked in Cable and Wireless plc’s accounts in respect of Pender. As these issues have been addressed, unused
provisions and accruals have been released as gains on termination of operations in the income statement of the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group. In the years ended 31 March 2007, 31 March 2008 and 31 March
2009 these releases amounted to US$34 million, US$12 million and US$3 million, respectively. At 30 September
2009, there was a further US$1 million remaining in the Cable and Wireless plc provision.

**BASIS OF PREPARATION**

**Overview**

The historical financial information discussed below represents the financial record as of and for the three years
ended 31 March 2009 and the two six month periods ended 30 September 2008 and 30 September 2009 of those
businesses that will be held by the Cable & Wireless Communications Group at the date of Admission.

The financial record is based on historical financial information extracted from the consolidation schedules
which supported the audited financial statements of the Cable & Wireless Group for the three years ended
31 March 2009 and the unaudited consolidation schedules for the six months ended 30 September 2008 and
30 September 2009.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group has not in the past formed a separate legal group and therefore it
is not meaningful to show share capital or an analysis of reserves for the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group. The net assets of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group are represented by the cumulative
investment in the Cable & Wireless Communications Group companies (shown as “invested capital”).

**_Application of IFRS_**

The historical financial information has been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European
Union, except as described below. The historical financial information has also been prepared in accordance with
applicable listing rules and requirements of the Prospectus Directive (including the regulation regarding issuers
with complex financial histories).

IFRS does not provide for the preparation of extracted financial information. Accordingly, the historical financial
information in this document has been prepared using certain commonly used accounting conventions (as
described in the Annexure to SIR 2000 (Investment Reporting Standard applicable to public reporting
engagements on historical financial information) issued by the UK Auditing Practices Board). The application of
these conventions results in the following material departures from IFRS. In all other respects, IFRS as adopted
by the European Union have been applied.

-----

**_Carved out and combined financial information_**

The historical financial information combines only the financial information for those businesses that will be
held by the Cable & Wireless Communications Group and therefore excludes financial information for those
subsidiaries of the Cable & Wireless Group that will form the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group after the
Demerger. Such excluded Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group subsidiaries, were, however, subsidiaries of
entities within the Cable & Wireless Communications Group during the periods presented. Such an approach
differs from the consolidation requirements of IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements which
requires consolidation of all subsidiaries.

**_Non-trading balances with the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group_**

On Demerger, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group will not be required to repay non-trading balances with
the Cable & Wireless Communications Group. For this reason, these amounts have been deducted from the Cable
& Wireless Communications Group’s invested capital, rather than being treated as assets as required by IFRS.

**_Other principles applied_**

In addition, the following principles have been applied in preparing the historical financial information:

    - There has been no allocation of the costs of the Central operations of the Cable & Wireless Group to
the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group. This is because any allocation would be arbitrary in nature
and may not reflect properly the costs relating to functions such as financial reporting and treasury and
Cable and Wireless plc Board costs, as would have been incurred by that business. Therefore, the costs
of the Central operations in the Cable & Wireless Communications Group represent 100% of the
corporate head office costs of the Cable & Wireless Group. These costs are not representative of the
level of historical head office costs of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business or of
the costs that may be required in the future.

    - The historical financial information is presented in US dollars (US dollars) and rounded to the nearest
million. Historically, the financial information in respect of those businesses included within the
historical accounts of Cable and Wireless plc has been presented in pounds sterling (£) as this was the
dominant functional currency of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group entities when the Cable
& Wireless Communications Group included other Cable & Wireless Group companies. However, as a
result of the Demerger of those entities, the dominant functional currency of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group entities has been determined to be US dollars as this is the primary currency in
which the exchange transactions of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group are priced.
Accordingly, the historical financial information has been presented as though US dollars was the
presentation currency throughout the period. The key exchange rates between sterling and US dollars in
the periods presented were:

- Trading balances with the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group are presented within receivables and
payables as though they were with an external party.

- The main UK defined benefit pension scheme operated by the Cable & Wireless Group provides
benefits to current and past employees of, and therefore represents obligations of, both the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group. For the period since
1 April 2006, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group have each borne a proportion of the service costs of this scheme based on the approximate split
of active membership. The scheme’s expected return on assets and interest expense have been
apportioned between the Cable & Wireless Communications Group and the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group based on the Directors’ assumptions about the underlying liabilities, being 20%
Cable & Wireless Communications Group and 80% Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group. The assets,
liabilities, actuarial gains and losses and cash flows relating to the scheme have been apportioned based
on 20% Cable & Wireless Communications Group and 80% Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group.

Detailed disclosures relating to this scheme are provided in “Historical Financial Information of the
_Cable & Wireless Communications Group” of this document._

65


-----

On Demerger, and as agreed with the scheme trustees, the liabilities of the main UK defined benefit
scheme will be allocated approximately equally between the Cable & Wireless Communications Group
and Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group over the period presented.

Management considers presenting the historical financial information over the periods according to the
historical allocation, better represents the underlying historical pension cost of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group.

If the historical financial information (which has been prepared on the basis of a split of 20% Cable &
Wireless Communications Group and 80% Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group) had been prepared on
the basis of the estimated split of assets and liabilities to be applied post-Demerger (i.e. a split of 50%
Cable & Wireless Communications Group and 50% Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group), the impact
on the relevant financial statements of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group would have been
as follows:

    - Tax charges in the historical financial information have been determined based on the tax charges
recorded by the Cable & Wireless Communications Group companies in their local statutory accounts
as well as certain adjustments relating to those entities made for Cable & Wireless Group consolidation
purposes. The tax charges recorded in the historical income statement have been affected by the tax
arrangements within the Cable & Wireless Group and are not necessarily representative of the tax
charges that would have been reported had the Cable & Wireless Communications Group been an
independent group. They are therefore not necessarily representative of the historical tax charges
attributable to the Cable & Wireless Communications Group or tax charges that may arise in the future.

This historical financial information has been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial
instruments held at fair value. Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale are stated at the lower of their
carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. The preparation of the historical financial information in
accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the
application of policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. These estimates and
associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are considered to be
reasonable under the circumstances. They form the basis of judgements about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual outcomes may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on a continuing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates
are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected. The accounting
policies used in the historical financial information for the periods presented have been applied consistently by
Cable & Wireless Communications Group entities.

**Principal Income Statement Line Items**

    - **_Revenue: The Cable & Wireless Communications Group revenue, which excludes discounts, value_**
added tax and similar sales taxes, represents the amount receivable in respect of services and
equipment provided to customers. It includes sales to joint ventures and associated companies but does
not include sales by joint ventures and associated companies or sales between the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group companies. Revenue is recognised only when payment is probable.

    - **_Cost of sales: The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s cost of sales are detailed in note 4 to_**
the “Historical Financial Information of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group”. Costs that are
either variable in line with changes in revenue or can be directly attributable to a single customer, for
example outpayments, mobile handsets and customer premise equipment (where not capitalised).

    - **_Gross margin: Gross margin is revenue less cost of sales._**

66


-----

    - **_Operating costs: Costs that are not variable in line with changes in revenue or cannot be directly_**
attributable to a single customer, for example salaries and wages, network maintenance and support,
property rental, utilities and travel.

    - **_EBITDA: The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s EBITDA is set forth in note 4 to the_**
historical financial statements in “Historical Financial Information of the Cable & Wireless
_Communications Group” and represents earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, LTIP_
charge, net other operating income/expense and, unless otherwise specified, exceptional items.

    - **_LTIP: Long Term Incentive Plan. In line with IAS 19, the expected payout is estimated at each_**
reporting period and the amount expected to that date accrued in the statement of financial position.
The charge to the income statement for the relevant period is primarily the movement in the statement
of financial position accrual.

    - **_Net other operating income or expense: Represents the net amount of income and expenses which are_**
not derived from underlying trading of the business but which are related to operations, for example,
insurance costs and receipts.

    - **_Net finance income or expense: Consists of the net amount of items such as interest on cash and_**
deposits and other investment income, and interest on loans and bonds, finance charges on leases and
the unwinding of discounts on provisions and other financial instruments.

    - **_Gains/losses on termination of operations: Represents the results of the Cable & Wireless_**
Communications Group’s former insurance operation, Pender, which ceased to underwrite any new
business in April 2003.

    - **_Gains/losses on sale of non-current assets: Arise on the sale of businesses that do not meet the_**
definition of discontinued operations or investments.

**Impact of Demerger**

In November 2009, the Cable and Wireless plc Board announced the proposed separation of Cable and Wireless
plc’s two businesses, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group,
into independently listed companies by way of the Demerger.

At Demerger the Cable & Wireless Communications Group is expected to have net debt representing
approximately 0.8 times, on a consolidated basis, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s EBITDA
guidance (excluding exceptional items) of US$880 – US$900 million for the year ending 31 March 2010 and
approximately 1.2 times on a proportionate ownership basis. This guidance does not include US$42 million of
Central operations costs. For further detail, see “Cable & Wireless Communications Group Selected Historical
_Financial Information”. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group has signed new three year facilities_
totalling US$500 million with margins of between 3.25% and 4.00% over LIBOR with a group of leading banks.
Cable & Wireless Communications Group has repaid and/or cancelled its previously existing US$415 million
facility and other undrawn facilities on or prior to 29 January 2010. At Demerger, the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group debt will, in addition to the Notes, also include the existing Cable and Wireless plc
sterling bonds due in 2012 (£195 million, approximately US$311 million as at 30 September 2009) and Cable &
Wireless International Finance B.V.’s sterling bonds due in 2019 (£147 million, approximately US$234 million
as at 30 September 2009) and a Cable and Wireless plc financing secured on assets other than the collateral
securing the Notes of £29 million as at 30 September 2009 (approximately US$42 million) as well as other debt
held in the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s local operations.

Upon Worldwide Admission, the Convertible Bonds become obligations of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group and, shortly before Demerger, the Convertible Bonds net proceeds will be transferred to the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group. For more details on the debt facility, refer to “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Convertible Bonds” of this document._

In the historical financial information, the 2009/10 corporate costs of the Central operations of the Cable and
Wireless Group have been included in full with the Cable & Wireless Communications Group. For the year
ended 31 March 2010 the corporate costs of the Central operations of the Cable & Wireless Group are expected
to be £28 million (US$42 million). It will be necessary for Cable & Wireless Communications and Cable &
Wireless Worldwide to incur the equivalent corporate costs in order to operate as independent, listed companies.
For the year ended 31 March 2011, these costs are expected to be US$24 million (£15 million) for Cable &
Wireless Communications and £10 million for Cable & Wireless Worldwide.

20% of the main UK defined benefit scheme assets and liabilities have historically been allocated to the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group. On the Demerger, approximately half of the pension assets and liabilities of

67


-----

the main defined benefit UK pension scheme operated by the Cable & Wireless Group will be transferred to the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group, with the other half remaining with the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group. If such a transfer had been effected at 30 September 2009, the portion of the US$486 million IAS 19
_Employee Benefits pension deficit on this scheme allocated to the Cable & Wireless Communications Group_
would have been approximately US$244 million, representing a US$146 million decrease to the historical net
assets presented for the Cable & Wireless Communications Group. The result of this change on the income
statement of Cable & Wireless Communications Group for the six months ended 30 September 2009 would have
been to decrease profit by US$1 million.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group have agreed to share
the use of the Cable & Wireless Trademarks on the terms of the Cable & Wireless Communications Licence and
the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Licence each as described in “Cable & Wireless Communications Group
_Business—Intellectual Property Arrangements”. The use of the Cable & Wireless Trademarks by the Cable &_
Wireless Communications Group and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group is restricted under the trademark
licence as described in the section entitled “Cable & Wireless Communications Group Business—Material
_Contracts”._

(1) EBITDA is a supplemental measure of Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s performance and
liquidity that is not required by or presented in accordance with IFRS. EBITDA should not be considered as
an alternative to IFRS measures, such as profit before tax and profit. Cable & Wireless Communications
Group uses EBITDA to facilitate operating performance comparisons and because it believes it is frequently
used by securities analysts. EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and prospective purchasers should
not consider it in isolation from, or as a substitute analysis for, Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s
results of operations.

**Commentary on Cable & Wireless Communications Group operating performance**

**_Comparison of the six months ended 30 September 2009 with the six months ended 30 September 2008_**

_Revenue_

In the six months ended 30 September 2009, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s total revenue
decreased by US$141 million, or 11%, to US$1,132 million, compared to the same period last year with declines
in all but broadband services. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s mobile revenue decreased by
US$25 million, or 5%, in the period to US$442 million, US$21 million of which was due to the adverse impact
of movements in exchange rates. Active GSM mobile customers in its subsidiaries increased by 73,000, or 2% to
3.6 million. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s broadband revenue increased by US$2 million, or
2%, to US$102 million in the period ended 30 September 2009. Broadband customers in the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s subsidiaries grew by 35,000, or 8%, to 491,000. The Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s domestic voice revenue fell by US$46 million, or 17%, to US$230 million and
international voice revenue declined by US$38 million, or 28%, to US$96 million. Fixed line connections in its
subsidiaries declined by 46,000, or 3%, to 1.5 million. Enterprise, data and other revenue decreased by US$34
million, or 11% in the period to US$262 million.

In the Caribbean operation, total revenue decreased by US$78 million, or 15%, to US$427 million compared to
the same period last year. US$30 million of this decrease was due to the weakening of the Jamaican dollar
against the US dollar. International voice revenue fell by US$21 million, or 36%, to US$38 million, primarily
driven by lower volume of minutes reflecting the global recession, continued fixed to mobile substitution and
increased VoIP usage and exchange rate movements (US$4 million). Domestic voice revenue decreased by
US$29 million, or 20%, to US$118 million due to the decline in minute volumes and movements in exchange
rates (US$13 million). Mobile revenue fell by US$21 million, or 11%, to US$162 million including a reduction
of US$7 million due to adverse movements in exchange rates. Mobile market share was maintained with an
increase in post-paid revenue. However, prepaid revenue decreased due to a fall in average revenue per user
(ARPU) as a result of a more competitive pricing environment and lower usage. Blended ARPU fell by 10%,
compared with the same period last year, primarily as a result of discounting through promotions in prepaid
mobile. Roaming revenue also decreased, particularly from tourist driven inbound traffic reflecting the effects of
the global recession on tourism in the Caribbean.

-----

In Panama, total revenue decreased by US$29 million, or 9%, to US$308 million, primarily because enterprise,
data and other revenue decreased by US$18 million, or 28%, to US$47 million following the delay in
government projects and the decrease in domestic voice revenue. Mobile revenue increased by US$4 million, or
3%, to US$150 million as market leadership was maintained despite two new competitors now being fully
operational. Domestic voice revenue fell by US$14 million or 16%, to US$71 million in the period as the fixed to
mobile substitution trend accelerated due to campaigns by competitors in the mobile market. Broadband revenue
grew by US$2 million, or 10%, as a result of an increased customer base and broadly maintained ARPU.

In Macau, CTM’s revenue decreased by US$2 million, or 1%, to US$157 million mainly because of the US$7
million, or 23%, decline in international voice revenue to US$24 million in the period reflecting the economic
environment coupled with some major cable outages in the region. Enterprise, data and other growth of 11%, or
US$3 million, to US$30 million was driven by an increase in leased line services and government spending in
managed services.

In Monaco & Islands, total revenue decreased by US$34 million, or 12%, to US$241 million. US$40 million of
this decrease was due to exchange rate movements in the euro, sterling and Seychelles rupees. There was decline
in all revenue streams except for broadband which was flat. Mobile revenue decreased by US$9 million, or 12%,
to US$66 million as a result of movements in exchange rates (US$14 million). Excluding exchange movements,
mobile revenue increased by 8% as a result of a 6% increase in customers. Enterprise, data and other revenue
decreased by US$14 million, or 10%, to US$122 million due to exchange rate movements (US$15 million). Data
hosting revenue in Bermuda and Guernsey increased in the period.

_Gross margin_

In the six months ended 30 September 2009, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s gross margin
decreased in line with revenue, down by US$84 million, or 10%, compared with the prior period to US$773
million. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was up one percentage point for the period to 68%.

_Operating costs (excluding exceptional items)_

In the six month period ended 30 September 2009, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s operating
costs were US$367 million, a decrease of US$67 million, or 15%, compared with the previous six month period
ended 30 September 2008. Movements in exchange rates accounted for US$27 million of this decrease.
Operating costs as a percentage of revenue were down two percentage points to 32%.

In the Caribbean operation, operating costs of US$187 million were US$26 million, or 12%, lower than in the
prior period, primarily as a result of a reduction in employee costs and the US$14 million impact of the
depreciation of the Jamaican dollar against the US dollar. The “One Caribbean” programme has delivered a
reduction in headcount of 881, or 24%, compared with the same period in the prior year. Whilst this had the
effect of driving a 12% reduction in employee costs, the maintenance of service quality resulted in increased
costs in other areas. The operating cost margin increased from 42% to 44% in the period.

In Panama, operating costs decreased by US$10 million, or 12%, to US$76 million. This was due to the impact
of cost rationalisation initiatives, including a 9% decrease in headcount as well as the one-off costs in the first
half of 2008/09 in preparation for the entry of two additional mobile operators. Operating costs as a percentage of
revenue were 25% for the six months ended 30 September 2009.

In Macau, operating costs decreased by US$5 million, or 17%, to US$24 million. The continued control of
employee, marketing and network costs has reduced operating costs as a percentage of revenue to 15%, from
18% in the six months ended 30 September 2008.

In Monaco & Islands, operating costs decreased by US$12 million, or 13%, to US$80 million as a result of
exchange movements (US$15 million). Excluding exchange movements, operating costs increased by 4% as
investments were made in expanding and enhancing the networks across the business, including an increase in
satellite bandwidth. The operating cost margin was flat at 33% in the period compared to the six months ended
30 September 2008.

_EBITDA (excluding exceptional items)_

As a result of the above movements in revenue and operating costs, the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group’s EBITDA decreased by US$17 million in the six months ended 30 September 2009, or 4%, to US$406
million compared to the prior period, with EBITDA margin up three percentage points to 36%.

73


-----

In the Caribbean operation, EBITDA decreased by US$30 million, or 19%, to US$132 million, reflecting the
revenue impact of the difficult trading environment and includes a US$6 million adverse impact from exchange
rates. EBITDA margin was 31% in the six months ended 30 September 2009 compared to 32% in the prior
period.

In Panama, EBITDA increased by US$4 million, or 3%, to US$138 million and EBITDA margin improved by
five percentage points to 45% reflecting the change in revenue mix and the focus on cost reduction initiatives.

In Macau, EBITDA increased by US$3 million, or 4%, to US$71 million, representing an improvement in the
margin of two percentage points to 45%. This increase was largely driven by the decrease in operating cost
margin in the period due to ongoing control of employee, marketing and network costs.

In Monaco & Islands, reported EBITDA at US$65 million was US$9 million, or 12%, lower than in the six
months ended 30 September 2008 but was US$2 million, or 3%, higher on a constant currency basis.

_Share of post-tax profit of joint ventures_

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s share of profit after tax from joint ventures was US$26 million,
down 27% from US$36 million in 2008/09. The share of profits from TSTT in Trinidad and Tobago of US$11
million fell by 8% on an underlying basis, but 45% on a reported basis, as the prior year included the release of
US$8 million of provisions held by the Central operations. Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s joint
venture in the Maldives, Dhiraagu, grew revenue by US$3 million, or 10%, and profit after tax by US$1 million,
or 8%, as it continued to grow mobile revenue and customers.

_Net finance expense_

The net finance expense excluding exceptional items increased US$31 million over the period to US$50 million
for the six months ended 30 September 2009. This reflected lower finance income due to a decrease in interest
rates and the lower average cash balances of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group and an increase in the
finance expense due to increased borrowings of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group.

_Exceptional items_

Net exceptional charges in the six months ended 30 September 2009 were US$4 million. This included US$31
million of exceptional operating costs relating to restructuring, primarily related to the “One Caribbean”
transformation programme and exceptional legal and other fees. This was offset by a non-operating exceptional
gain of US$27 million was recognised arising from marking to market of forward contracts used for hedging
purposes as required by IAS 39.

**_Comparison of the year ended 31 March 2009 with the year ended 31 March 2008_**

_Revenue_

In the year ended 31 March 2009, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s total revenue decreased by
US$15 million, or 1%, to US$2,447 million due to the US$41 million adverse impact of movement in exchange
rates. Cable & Wireless Communications mobile revenue increased by US$24 million, or 3%, in the year to
US$907 million. Active GSM mobile customers in its subsidiaries increased by almost 800,000, or 24%, to 4.1
million. However, ARPU decreased as a result of increasing levels of competition and the challenging economic
environment. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s broadband revenue increased by US$16 million,
or 9%, to US$199 million in the year ended 31 March 2009. Broadband customers in the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s subsidiaries grew by 42,000, or 10%, to 476,000. Domestic voice revenue fell by
US$22 million, or 4%, to US$519 million and international voice revenue declined by US$37 million, or 13%, to
US$245 million. The decrease in voice is largely structurally driven by fixed to mobile and VoIP substitution
exacerbated by the economic downturn. Fixed line connections in the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group’s subsidiaries remained relatively steady at 1.5 million. Enterprise, data and other revenue increased by
US$4 million, or 1%, in the year to US$577 million.

In the Caribbean operation, in the year ended 31 March 2009, total revenue was US$975 million, a US$46
million, or 5%, decrease on the prior year as declines in mobile, international voice and enterprise, data and other
more than offset broadband revenue growth. The weakening of the Jamaican dollar against the US dollar
accounted for US$19 million of this decrease. Domestic voice revenue remained stable at US$276 million in the

74


-----

year as movements in exchange rates (US$7 million) offset increases through trading. Substitution by other
services such as mobile and VoIP and movements in exchange rates (US$3 million) led to a US$26 million, or
20%, decline in international voice revenue to US$107 million. Mobile revenue declined by US$13 million, or
4%, to US$354 million in the year reflecting a softening of demand and lower tourist numbers in the Caribbean
islands and movements in exchange rates (US$5 million). The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s
mobile customer base in its Caribbean operation subsidiaries decreased by approximately 6,000, or less than 1%,
in the year to 1.3 million as a result of increased competition.

In Panama, in the year ended 31 March 2009, total revenue was US$667 million, a US$50 million, or 8%,
increase on the prior year, driven largely by mobile and enterprise, data and other revenue. Mobile revenue
increased by US$33 million or 12%, to US$301 million following intensive marketing and promotional activity
in preparation for the entry of new competitors. Enterprise, data and other revenue increased by US$29 million,
or 30%, to US$125 million with the roll out of large government contracts including those for video surveillance,
e-learning and the 911 emergency services centre.

In Macau, in the year ended 31 March 2009, total revenue was US$302 million, a US$11 million, or 4%, increase
on the prior year. The growth in mobile and broadband revenue driven by customers using Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s new 3G service for mobile and higher bandwidth and increased customer base for
broadband, was partially offset by a US$4 million, or 7%, decline in enterprise revenue to US$51 million as a
number of high profile hotel and casino projects were put on hold.

In Monaco & Islands, in the year ended 31 March 2009, total revenue was US$506 million, a US$20 million, or
4%, decrease on the prior year. Movements in exchange rates accounted for virtually all of this decrease. The
growth in mobile and broadband revenue was offset by a decline in international voice and enterprise, data and
other revenue. Monaco & Islands includes Monaco, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, Bermuda,
Seychelles, the Maldives (consolidated from October 2009), the South Atlantic Region and Diego Garcia and
was the most affected of each of its regional operations by the movements in foreign exchange rates during the
year. At the exchange rates used for the year to 31 March 2009, revenue in Monaco & Islands was flat year on
year.

_Gross margin_

In the year ended 31 March 2009, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s gross margin increased by
US$41 million, or 3%, compared with the prior year to US$1,656 million. Gross margin as a percentage of
revenue was up two percentage points for the year to 68%. Costs of sales decreased from US$847 million to
US$791 million primarily due to exchange rate movements and cost reduction activities.

_Operating costs (excluding exceptional items)_

In the year ended 31 March 2009, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s operating costs were US$785
million, a decrease of US$56 million, or 7%, compared with the year ended 31 March 2008 primarily reflecting
cost-management initiatives in the Caribbean operation. Movements in exchange rates accounted for
US$25 million of this decrease. Operating costs as a percentage of revenue were down two percentage points to
32%.

In the Caribbean operation, operating costs for the year ended 31 March 2009 decreased by US$38 million, or
9%, compared with the prior year to US$381 million which included savings generated from an integrated
pan-Caribbean advertising and marketing approach and a decrease in headcount and movements in exchange
rates (US$9 million), primarily the weakening of the Jamaican dollar against the US dollar.

In Panama, operating costs for the year ended 31 March 2009 increased by US$19 million, or 13%, to US$165
million as investments in service and distribution in preparation for the entry of additional mobile competition
were made. US$5 million of non-recurring cost occurred in the first half of 2008/09 and operating costs returned
to more sustainable levels in the second half as cost saving initiatives (including a 4% reduction in headcount)
began to take effect. As a percentage of revenue, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s operating costs
in Panama increased by 1%.

In Macau, operating costs for the year ended 31 March 2009 declined against the prior year by US$1 million, or
2%, to US$53 million mainly driven by lower employee costs as a result of cost control initiatives.

Monaco & Islands’ operating costs decreased by 5% to US$168 million due mainly to changes in exchange rates
primarily the euro. Excluding this, operating costs increased by 1%.

_EBITDA (excluding exceptional items)_

As a result of the above movements in gross margin and operating costs, the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group’s EBITDA in the year ended 31 March 2009 grew by US$97 million, or 13%, to US$871 million.
EBITDA margin increased from 31% to 36%. Before the inclusion of Central’s costs, the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s EBITDA increased by US$91 million, or 11%, to US$921 million and represented
38% of revenue compared to 34% in the prior year driven primarily by EBITDA margin improvements in the
Caribbean operation.

In the Caribbean operation, EBITDA in the year ended 31 March 2009 increased by US$45 million, or 15%, to
US$337 million. EBITDA margin increased from 29% to 35%, including US$12 million, or 24%, increase in
Jamaica’s EBITDA to US$63 million as gross margins were restored and operating costs reduced after the poor
performance in 2007/08.

In Panama, EBITDA in the year ended 31 March 2009, grew by US$22 million, or 9%, to US$276 million driven
by revenue growth. EBITDA margin was constant at 41%.

In Macau, EBITDA in the year ended 31 March 2009, increased by US$15 million, or 12%, to US$139 million
and represented 46% of revenue, a three percentage point increase on the year ended 31 March 2008.

In Monaco & Islands, EBITDA in the year ended 31 March 2009 was US$137 million, a US$2 million, or 1%,
fall from the prior year as a result of the operating costs movement described above. EBITDA margin increased
from 26% to 27%.

_Depreciation and amortisation_

Depreciation and amortisation increased by US$10 million, or 4%, in the year ended 31 March 2009 to US$294
million as the Cable & Wireless Communications Group has invested more on capital expenditure in recent
years. For more details on capital expenditure see “—Capital Expenditure”.

_Share of post-tax profit of joint ventures_

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s share of the post-tax profit of joint ventures and associates
decreased by US$17 million, or 22%, in the year ended 31 March 2009 to US$60 million. This reduction was
driven by TSTT (Trinidad and Tobago) and Roshan (Afghanistan), partially offset by growth in Dhiraagu (the
Maldives). TSTT contributed US$30 million to the share of profit after tax compared with US$44 million in
2007/08 (which included the release of a US$9 million provision). In Roshan, the US$4 million loss after tax is
largely due to a US$5 million write down of obsolete network equipment. The share of profit after tax in
Dhiraagu grew by US$4 million, or 17%, to US$28 million in the year ended 31 March 2009, mainly due to the
19% growth in mobile customers.

_Net finance expense_

In the year ended 31 March 2009, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s net finance expense increased
by US$29 million, or 91%, compared with the prior year to US$61 million. This reflected lower finance income
due to a decrease in interest rates and the lower average cash balances of the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group and an increase in the finance expense due to increased borrowings of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group.

_Exceptional items_

In the year ended 31 March 2009, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group recorded exceptional costs
before tax of US$198 million compared with exceptional costs of US$109 million in the year ended 31 March
2008.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s transformation programme continued in the year ended
31 March 2009 with gross restructuring costs of US$100 million primarily relating to the “One Caribbean”
transformation programme, the streamlining of the London office (including a 27% reduction in headcount),
efficiency programmes in Panama and Monaco & Islands and an onerous lease provision. These costs were
partially offset by a US$14 million exceptional net gain primarily from the restructuring of the Jamaican

retirement funds. A US$12 million tax credit was recorded against the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group’s restructuring charges. An exceptional non-operating loss of US$98 million was also recognised arising
from the marking to market of forward contracts used for hedging purposes as required by IAS 39.

**_Comparison of the year ended 31 March 2008 with the year ended 31 March 2007_**

_Revenue_

In the year ended 31 March 2008, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s total revenue increased by
US$152 million, or 7%, to US$2,462 million as growth in mobile, broadband and enterprise, data and other
revenue more than offset declines in domestic and international voice. The Cable & Wireless Communications
Group’s mobile revenue increased by US$119 million, or 16%, in the year to US$883 million and active GSM
mobile customers in its subsidiaries increased by almost 750,000 or 28%, to 3.3 million. The Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s broadband revenue increased by US$38 million, or 26%, to US$183 million in the year
ended 31 March 2008, and broadband customers in Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s subsidiaries
grew by 15% to 434,000. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s domestic voice revenue fell by US$37
million, or 6%, to US$541 million and international voice revenue declined by US$34 million, or 11%, to
US$282 million. Although fixed line connections in its subsidiaries remained relatively steady at 1.5 million,
minutes of use decreased due to mobile and VoIP substitution. Enterprise, data and other revenue increased by
US$66 million, or 13%, in the year to US$573 million.

In the Caribbean operation in the year ended 31 March 2008, total revenue declined by US$20 million, or 2%, to
US$1,021 million as declines in domestic and international voice more than offset mobile and broadband revenue
growth. Domestic voice revenue declined by US$34 million, or 11%, to US$276 million in the year, US$29
million relating largely to the poor performance of a prepaid fixed line product in Jamaica, a product which the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group withdrew in July 2007. There was a US$40 million, or 23%, decline
in international voice revenue in the Caribbean operation to US$133 million in the year ended 31 March 2008.
Mobile revenue grew by US$42 million, or 13%, to US$367 million in the year as the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group expanded its regional network coverage and launched mobile services in the British
Virgin Islands (BVI). Mobile customers increased by 135,000, or 12%, in the year to 1.3 million, contributing to
an increase in revenue.

In Panama, in the year ended 31 March 2008, total revenue was US$617 million, a US$74 million, or 14%,
increase on the prior year, driven largely by mobile, broadband, international voice and enterprise, data and other
revenue. Mobile revenue increased by US$37 million, or 16%, to US$268 million as network coverage was
improved, contributing to greater market penetration and distribution channels and preparing for the entry of new
competitors. Mobile customers increased by 547,000, or 50%, to 1.6 million in the year ended 31 March 2008.
Enterprise, data and other revenue in Panama grew by US$28 million, or 41%, to US$96 million as a result of the
business winning large contracts such as the Telemedicine and CCTV contracts with the government of Panama
in the first half of the year ended 31 March 2008. Broadband revenue increased from US$28 million to US$36
million, an increase of 29%, primarily due to higher value packages and increased coverage. Fixed line revenue
at US$217 million was broadly flat.

In Macau, in the year ended 31 March 2008, total revenue was US$291 million, US$22 million, or 8%, more
than the prior year. This was largely driven by broadband revenue which increased by US$10 million to US$38
million in the year with the launch of 10Mbps services to every household and service speeds of up to 100Mbps
to businesses with specific needs.

In Monaco & Islands, in the year ended 31 March 2008, total revenue grew by US$66 million, or 14%, to
US$526 million. Mobile revenue grew by US$26 million, or 25%, to US$132 million in the year and mobile
customers decreased by 2,000 to 141,000. This was largely due to the introduction of new products in Monaco
such as prepaid mobile, push email and other mobile data services, and the launch of services in Jersey and the
Isle of Man. Enterprise, data and other revenue grew by US$36 million, or 16%, to US$268 million, largely due
to growth in Monaco Telecom’s international traffic management contracts with PTK in Kosovo and Roshan in
Afghanistan.

_Gross margin_

In the year ended 31 March 2008, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s gross margin increased in line
with revenue, growing by US$92 million, or 6%, compared with the prior year to US$1,615 million. Gross
margin as a percentage of revenue was unchanged for the year at 66%.

77


-----

_Operating costs (excluding exceptional items)_

In the year ended 31 March 2008, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s operating costs were US$841
million, an increase of US$85 million, or 11%, compared with the year ended 31 March 2007. Operating cost
margin increased from 33% to 34%.

In the Caribbean operation, operating costs for the year ended 31 March 2008 increased by US$30 million, or
8%, to US$419 million. US$13 million of this increase related to higher call centre and administration costs in
Jamaica. The remainder was due to additional support costs as the Cable & Wireless Communications Group
migrated to new data networks and additional costs following the launch of mobile services in the BVI.
Operating cost margin increased from 37% to 41%.

In Panama, operating costs for the year ended 31 March 2008 increased by US$13 million, or 10%, to US$146
million in support of the business’ rapid revenue growth. As a percentage of revenue, the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s operating costs in Panama were steady at 24%.

In Macau, operating costs for the year ended 31 March 2008 increased by US$6 million, or 13%, compared with
the prior year to US$54 million broadly flat at 19% of revenue.

In Monaco & Islands, operating costs for the year ended 31 March 2008 increased by US$34 million, or 24% to
US$177 million. This increase reflected the launch and growth of mobile businesses in Jersey and the Isle of Man
and the release of US$10 million of provisions in Monaco in the year ended 31 March 2007. Operating cost
margin increased from 31% to 34%.

Costs of the Central operations of the Cable & Wireless Group increased US$15 million, or 37%, in the year
ended 31 March 2008 to US$56 million, partly due to the benefit of the release of an accrual after settlement of a
PAYE creditor in the prior year that was not repeated in the year ended 31 March 2008.

_EBITDA (excluding exceptional items)_

As a result of the above movements in revenue and operating costs, Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s
EBITDA in the year ended 31 March 2008 grew by US$7 million, or 1%, to US$774 million. Before the
inclusion of the costs of the Central operations of the Cable & Wireless Group, the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s EBITDA increased by US$22 million, or 3%, to US$830 million and represented 34%
of revenue compared to 35% of revenue the previous period.

In the Caribbean operation, EBITDA in the year ended 31 March 2008 decreased by US$57 million, or 16%, to
US$292 million. This decline included a US$63 million decline in Jamaica’s results in the year to US$51 million
as a result of the revenue and cost issues described above. EBITDA margin was 29% in this period.

In Panama, EBITDA in the year ended 31 March 2008, grew by US$38 million, or 18%, to US$254 million. This
represented 41% of revenue for the year compared to 40% in the prior year. This growth in EBITDA was
primarily driven by revenue growth which was partially offset by increases in operating costs primarily to
support that growth.

In Macau, EBITDA in the year ended 31 March 2008, increased by US$20 million, or 19%, to US$124 million
and represented 43% of revenue, a four percentage point increase on the year ended 31 March 2007.

In Monaco & Islands, EBITDA in the year ended 31 March 2008 was US$139 million, a US$2 million, or 1%,
fall from the prior year as a result of the operating costs movement described above. EBITDA margin was 26%
in this period.

_Depreciation and amortisation_

Depreciation and amortisation increased by US$11 million, or 4%, in the year ended 31 March 2008 to US$284
million reflecting the increase in the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s capital expenditure in recent
years. For more details on capital expenditure see “—Capital Expenditure”.

_Net other operating income_

Net other operating income in the year ended 31 March 2008 reduced by US$2 million, or 29%, to US$5 million,
which primarily relates to gains on the disposal of fixed assets.

78


-----

_Share of post-tax profit of joint ventures_

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s share of the post-tax profit of joint ventures increased by US$38
million, or 97%, in the year ended 31 March 2008 to US$77 million. The result reflects an improved performance
by TSTT, its joint venture in Trinidad and Tobago, which contributed a US$44 million profit (including a US$9
million release of a provision held by the Central operations) compared with a US$23 million loss in the prior
year as a result of the success of restructuring efforts targeted at improving performance. This was partially offset
by the impact of the disposal of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s stake in Batelco (Bahrain) in
January 2007 which contributed US$22 million in the year ended 31 March 2007.

_Net finance expense_

In the year ended 31 March 2008, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s net finance expense decreased
by US$9 million, or 22%, compared with the prior year to US$32 million. This comprises finance income of
US$96 million (US$96 million in the year ended 31 March 2007) and finance expense of US$128 million
(US$137 million in the year ended 31 March 2007).

The US$9 million reduction in finance expense was a result of reduced interest expense following the repurchase
and conversion of Cable and Wireless plc convertible bonds in the year ended 31 March 2008 and reduced
interest relating to the put option on Monaco Telecom business, partially offset by increased interest on debt.

_Gain on termination of operations_

The US$17 million gain on termination of operations in the year ended 31 March 2008 relates to progress in
addressing issues relating to Cable and Wireless plc’s former insurance operation, Pender, which allowed the
release of certain provisions and accruals.

_Exceptional items_

In the year ended 31 March 2008, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group recorded exceptional costs
before tax of US$109 million compared with exceptional gains of US$267 million in the year ended 31 March
2007.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group recorded US$101 million of exceptional operating costs in the
year ended 31 March 2008 which included US$33 million for restructuring costs as part of the programme to
transform its service and brand reputation. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group successfully concluded
a transaction to repatriate US$48 million that had previously been blocked in the Seychelles due to exchange
controls. As a result, a net gain before taxation of US$28 million was recorded after the release of provisions
held against these funds. As a consequence of this transaction a US$10 million tax charge was recorded.

In July 2007, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group received a claim from its main Caribbean
competitor, Digicel. Based on legal advice, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group expected to
successfully defend the claim, but recorded a charge of US$22 million for the legal and other fees related to its
defence which was included in operating costs as an exceptional item.

As part of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s year end review of asset carrying values, assets in
Jamaica were written down by US$74 million reflecting the poor trading performance of the business during the
period and additional competition in the mobile market. A US$25 million tax credit was recorded against this
charge.

Convertible bonds with a par value of £138 million (US$276 million) were repurchased for cash of £190 million
(US$380 million) by Cable and Wireless plc. This resulted in an accounting loss of US$20 million which is the
difference between the carrying and fair value of the underlying debt component of the repurchased bonds.
Following progress in resolving historical claims and other risks, US$12 million of unused provisions relating to
Cable and Wireless plc’s former insurance operation, Pender, were released.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s principal source of liquidity is cash flow from operations
supported by bank financing and bond issuances. As at September 30, 2009, the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group had net cash and cash equivalents of US$437 million and undrawn credit lines of
US$152 million. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s financing arrangements are described in more
detail in “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements”.

79


-----

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s principal use of funds are costs of sales (primarily costs
associated with network and interconnecting services) and operating costs (primarily employee costs and
network maintenance) (see “Principal Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Cost Drivers”). The Cable &
Wireless Communications Group also continues to invest in fixed assets to enhance its networks where it will
increase future revenue (see section entitled “—Capital Expenditure”).

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s treasury operations are delegated to the Chief Financial Officer,
the Treasurer and the Treasury department (collectively, the Treasury), which manages its net interest-bearing
debt and cash balances on a day-to-day basis. Treasury is mandated to ensure the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group has adequate funding at all times to meet its projected requirements, and that funding is
arranged on the most appropriate terms taking into account the circumstances of the funding requirement. Where
appropriate, Treasury will look to match the currency of debt with the carrying value of foreign currency
investments in order to hedge the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s foreign currency net asset
exposures. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash, short term deposits and other liquid investments with an
appropriate short term maturity not exceeding three months. For a discussion of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s policies as related to management of market risk, see the section entitled “Qualitative
_and quantitative disclosures on market risk” below._

**_Comparison of the six months ended 30 September 2009 with the six months ended 30 September 2008_**

At 30 September 2009, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group had US$437 million of cash and cash
equivalents.

Net cash from operating activities decreased by US$42 million in the six month period to 30 September 2009
compared to the six month period to 30 September 2008. The decrease was the result of an increased working
capital outflow in the six months ended 30 September 2009 due to a reduction in trade payables and an increase
in the level of prepayments.

Net cash used in investing activities was US$93 million in the six month period ended 30 September 2009
compared to US$124 million in the six month period to 30 September 2008, a decrease of US$31 million. This
resulted primarily from the decrease in capital expenditure in the period to US$109 million compared to US$169
million in the six months ended 30 September 2008.

As a result of the above, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s net cash flow before financing
decreased by US$11 million to US$116 million in the six month period ended 30 September 2009 compared to
30 September 2008.

Net cash used in financing activities decreased by US$77 million to US$303 million in the six month period
ended 30 September 2009 compared to the six month period ended 30 September 2008. In the six month period

80


-----

to 30 September 2008, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group contributed US$210 million to the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group primarily for the acquisition of THUS Group and drew down a net US$112 million
of facilities compared to US$35 million and US$18 million respectively for the six month period ended
30 September 2009. Borrowings drawn down in the six months ended 30 September 2009 were US$192 million
compared with US$38 million in the six months ended 30 September 2008. Borrowings repaid were US$80
million compared to US$20 million in the six months ended 30 September 2008.

**_Comparison of the year ended 31 March 2009 with the year ended 31 March 2008_**

At 31 March 2009, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group had US$581 million of cash and cash
equivalents representing a US$779 million decrease from 31 March 2008.

Net cash from operating activities decreased US$79 million in the year ended 31 March 2009 compared with
US$715 million in the prior year. This decrease was the result of a US$27 million decline in working capital due
to the timing of receipts and payments, and other provisions, including exceptional provisions largely relating to
the “One Caribbean” transformation programme and a US$23 million increase in income tax payments.

Net cash used in investing activities was US$314 million in the year ended 31 March 2009 compared with
US$307 million in the prior year. Capital expenditure at US$359 million was 2% less than the prior year
reflecting the ordinary course phasing of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s capital expenditure
programmes and represented 14% of revenue.

As a result of the above, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s net cash flow before financing activities
decreased by US$86 million in the year ended 31 March 2009 to an inflow of US$322 million.

Net cash used in financing activities decreased from US$1,110 million in the year ended 31 March 2008 to a
US$881 million in the year ended 31 March 2009. In the year ended 31 March 2009, the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group drew down a net US$480 million from borrowings and contributed US$842 million to
the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group primarily for the acquisition of THUS Group plc compared with a net
repayment of borrowings of US$473 million and a contribution of US$174 million in the prior year.

**_Comparison of the year ended 31 March 2008 with the year ended 31 March 2007_**

At 31 March 2008, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group had US$1,360 million of cash and cash
equivalents representing a US$657 million decrease from 31 March 2007.

Net cash from operating activities increased US$94 million in the year ended 31 March 2008 to US$715 million.
This increase was primarily due to a US$101 million improvement in movement in working capital, including
exceptional provisions reflecting continued focus on working capital management.

Net cash used in investing activities was US$307 million in the year ended 31 March 2008 compared with a
US$353 million inflow in the prior year. This decrease of US$660 million was a result of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s disposal of its stake in Batelco in January 2007 which contributed a US$481 million
inflow in the year ended 31 March 2007. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group also recorded an
additional outflow of US$163 million in the year ended 31 March 2008 which included a US$59 million increase
in the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s capital expenditure and acquisitions of a further stake in Cable
& Wireless St Kitts and Nevis Limited and the purchase of Connecteo.

As a result of the above, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s net cash flow before financing activities
decreased by US$566 million in the year ended 31 March 2008 to US$408 million.

Net cash used in financing activities increased from US$1,083 million in the year ended 31 March 2007 to
US$1,110 million in the year ended 31 March 2008. In the year ended 31 March 2008, the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group contributed US$174 million to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group and had net
draw down on borrowings of US$473 million compared with US$535 million and US$151 million respectively
in the prior year.

**Capital Expenditure**

**_Comparison of the six months ended 30 September 2009 with the six months ended 30 September 2008_**

In the six months ended 30 September 2009, capital expenditure decreased by 33% compared to the same period
in the prior year to US$104 million reflecting the phasing of Cable & Wireless Communications Group capital
expenditure programmes through 2009/10. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group focused on upgrading
and expanding its networks to improve mobile, broadband and enterprise services. The Cable & Wireless
Communications Group also invested in IT systems across the businesses to support its cost saving initiatives.
Mobile projects included enhancing the coverage and capacity of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s
2G and 3G networks in Panama, Macau, Jamaica and Jersey, as well as preparation for the launch of 3G in
Guernsey. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group also continued to invest in broadband coverage in high
value customer areas.

**_Comparison of the year ended 31 March 2009 with the year ended 31 March 2008_**

In the year ended 31 March 2009, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s capital expenditure decreased
by US$44 million to US$337 million and represented 14% of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s
revenue. The investment focused on supporting the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s transformation
activities, including investments in IT systems to ensure that the cost and headcount efficiency programmes were
sustainable. Further upgrade and expansion of networks to enable improved mobile, broadband and enterprise
services were also undertaken.

**_Comparison of the year ended 31 March 2008 with the year ended 31 March 2007_**

In the year ended 31 March 2008, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s capital expenditure increased
by US$66 million to US$381 million and represented 15% of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s
revenue compared to 14% in the prior period. This included a US$29 million investment in new mobile spectrum
in Panama which increased network capacity, reduced network congestion in key areas and added data
functionality ahead of the introduction of additional mobile competition.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group invested over 80% of its capital expenditure in mobile and
broadband in the year ended 31 March 2008, launching 3G services in Macau and expanding its mobile and
broadband networks in Panama, Monaco and the Caribbean. This represented 12% of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s revenue for the year. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group also enhanced its
submarine cable network by laying a cable into Bermuda from the United States and increased its network
capacity and resilience across the Caribbean.

**Taxation**

The jurisdictions in which the Cable & Wireless Communications Group operates have a wide range of tax rates
in place, from nil to 40%. In addition, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group incurs withholding taxes on
certain of its internal recharges and dividends received from its subsidiaries and joint ventures. The result is that
the effective tax rate for the whole business varies from year to year based on the mix of profits from the
individual businesses, the extent to which profits are remitted as dividends and the distribution of recharges

82


-----

across individual businesses. Over the period under review, the effective tax rate has been 12% in the year ended
31 March 2007, 24% in the year ended 31 March 2008, 22% in the year ended 31 March 2009 and 27% in the six
months ended 30 September 2009. The main change in the effective tax rates during the periods presented was
due to the sale of Batelco in January 2007 which resulted in an exceptional gain of US$288 million which was
tax-free. In addition, as the Cable & Wireless Communications Group is domiciled in the United Kingdom, it is
subject to UK tax on any profits realised or deemed to be realised in the United Kingdom. For further discussion,
see “Risk Factors”.

**Qualitative and quantitative disclosures on market risk**

**_Treasury policy_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk
(including currency risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s overall risk management programme seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s financial performance.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s treasury operations are managed on the basis of policies and
authorities approved by the Cable and Wireless plc Board. These policies will be adopted by the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group in substantially the same form post-Demerger. Day to day management of
treasury activities is delegated to Treasury, within specified financial limits for each type of transaction and
counterparty.

To the extent that subsidiaries undertake treasury transactions, these are governed by the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group policies and delegated authorities. Material subsidiary positions are monitored by
Treasury. Where appropriate, transactions are reported to the Board. All subsidiaries are required to report details
of their cash and debt positions to Treasury on a monthly basis.

The key responsibilities of Treasury include funding, investment of surplus cash and the management of interest
rate and foreign currency risk. The majority of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s cash resources
and borrowings are managed centrally by Treasury.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group may use derivatives including forward foreign exchange
contracts, interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps and options where appropriate in the management of its
foreign currency and interest rate exposures. The use of these instruments is in accordance with strategies agreed
from time to time by Treasury, subject to policies approved by the Cable & Wireless Communications Group
Board. Derivatives are not used for trading or speculative purposes and derivative transactions and positions are
monitored and reported by Treasury on a regular basis and are subject to policies adopted by the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group Board.

**_Exchange rate risk_**

When the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group was part of the Cable & Wireless Group, the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s transactions were reported in sterling and all non-sterling cash flows were subject to
foreign exchange risk. As a result, at 30 September 2009, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group had in
place forward exchange contracts to sell US$112 million (31 March 2009—US$225 million, 31 March 2008—
US$50 million). The Cable & Wireless Communications Group could not apply hedge accounting to these
contracts and as a result they were revalued to fair value through the income statement.

From Demerger, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group will report its results in US dollars, as this is the
predominant transaction currency of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group trades in many countries and a proportion of its revenue is
generated in currencies other than US dollars (the dominant functional currency of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group entities), notably the euro, sterling and Jamaican dollar. The Cable & Wireless
Communications Group is exposed to movements in exchange rates in relation to non-US dollar currency
payments, dividend income from foreign subsidiaries, reported profits of foreign subsidiaries and the net asset
carrying value of non-US dollar investments. Exchange risk is managed centrally (by Treasury) on a matching
cash flow basis including forecast foreign currency cash repatriation inflows from subsidiaries and forecast
foreign currency payments. Details of the net currency position of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group
are set out in notes 28 and 29 to “Historical Financial Information of the Cable & Wireless Communications
_Group”._

83


-----

Where appropriate, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group manages its exposure to movements in
exchange rates on a net basis and uses forward foreign exchange contracts and other derivative and financial
instruments to reduce the exposures created where currencies do not naturally offset in the short term. The Cable
& Wireless Communications Group will undertake hedges to minimise the exposure to individual transactions
that create significant foreign exchange exposures for the Cable & Wireless Communications Group where
appropriate. Where cost-effective and possible, foreign subsidiaries are financed in their domestic currency to
minimise the impact of translation of foreign currency denominated borrowings.

The reported profits of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group are translated in accordance with IFRS at
average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Earnings are predominantly in US dollars or currencies
linked to the US dollar. In broad terms, based on the mix of profits for the year ended 31 March 2009, the impact
of a unilateral 10% weakening of the US dollar would have been to increase operating profit before exceptional
items by approximately US$16 million and increase total invested capital by US$33 million. The Cable &
Wireless Communications Group had approximately US$319 million of net financial liabilities denominated in
US dollar or US dollar linked currencies at the end of the year.

As part of the overall policy of managing the exposure arising from foreign exchange movements relating to the
net carrying value of overseas investments, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group may, from time to
time, elect to match certain foreign currency liabilities against the carrying value of foreign investments.

**_Interest rate risk_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group is exposed to movements in interest rates on its surplus cash
balances and variable rate loans, although there is a degree of offset between the two. Treasury may seek to reduce
volatility by fixing a proportion of this interest rate exposure whilst taking account of prevailing market conditions
as appropriate. There were no interest rate derivatives in place during any of the historical periods presented.

At 30 September 2009, 55% of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s borrowings were at a fixed rate.
A reduction in interest rates would have an unfavourable impact upon the fair value of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s fixed rate borrowings. However, no debt is held for trading purposes and it is intended
that it will be kept in place until maturity. As a result, there is no exposure to fair value loss on fixed rate debt
and as such, it has not been modelled.

A one percentage point increase in interest rates will have a US$4 million impact on the income received from
the surplus cash balances of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group and a US$5 million impact on the
floating rate borrowings of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group. The impact on invested capital is
limited to the impact on the income statement.

**_Credit risk_**

Cash deposits and similar financial instruments give rise to credit risk, which represents the loss that would be
recognised if a counterparty failed to perform as contracted. Management seeks to manage this risk by ensuring
the counterparties to all but a small proportion of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s financial
instruments are the core relationship banks, which are rated A1 short-term and/or AA—long-term (or better) by
Standard & Poor’s (or equivalent by Moody’s and/or Fitch). The credit rating of these counterparties is
monitored on a continuing basis.

The types of instrument used for investment of funds are prescribed in the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group treasury policies approved by the Cable and Wireless plc Board. These policies contain limits on exposure
for the Cable & Wireless Communications Group as a whole to any one counterparty of approximately US$100
million.

**_Liquidity risk_**

At 30 September 2009, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group had cash and cash equivalents of US$437
million. These amounts are highly liquid and are a significant component of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s overall liquidity and capital resources.

Liquidity forecasts are produced on a regular basis to ensure the utilisation of current facilities is optimised, to
ensure covenant compliance and that medium-term liquidity is maintained and for the purpose of identifying
long-term strategic funding requirements. The Directors also regularly assess the balance of capital and debt
funding of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group.

**Off balance sheet arrangements**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s off balance sheet arrangements consist of capital commitments
as well as guarantees and contingent liabilities.

**_Capital commitments: The Cable & Wireless Communications Group had capital commitments at 30 September_**
2009 relating to the purchase of property, plant and equipment of US$49 million. No provision was made for
these commitments and they will stay with the Cable & Wireless Communications Group after the Demerger.
US$46 million of these commitments related to the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s share of the
capital commitments of its joint ventures and associates.

In addition, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group had a number of operating commitments arising in the
ordinary course of its business. The most significant of these related to network operating and maintenance costs.
In the event of default of another party, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group may be liable to additional
contributions under the terms of the agreements.

Trading guarantees principally comprised performance bonds issued in the normal course of business,
guaranteeing that the Cable & Wireless Communications Group or Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group will
meet their respective obligations to complete projects in accordance with the contractual terms and conditions.
The guarantees contain a clause that they will be terminated on final acceptance of work to be done under the
contract. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group has provided guarantees to third parties in respect of
trading contracts between these third parties and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group. Included in the table
above are amounts relating to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s contracts of US$800 million. The Cable
& Wireless Worldwide Group has agreed a fee schedule with Cable & Wireless Communications Group for the
benefit of these guarantees post-Demerger. US$336 million of the guarantees contain conditional rights of
substitution relating to the Demerger. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has indemnified Cable &
Wireless Communications in respect of these guarantees. To date, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group
has not been required to make any payments in respect of its obligations under its trading guarantees.

Other guarantees include guarantees for financial obligations principally in respect of borrowing, leases and
letters of credit.

In addition, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group has, as is considered standard practice in such
agreements, given guarantees and indemnities in relation to a number of disposals of subsidiary undertakings in
prior years. Generally, liability has been capped at no more than the value of the sales proceeds, although some
uncapped indemnities have been given. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group also gives warranties and
indemnities in relation to certain agreements including facility sharing agreements. Some of these agreements do
not contain liability caps.

At 30 September 2009, the Cable & Wireless Group had the following sterling-denominated bonds which have
been included in the results of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group:

    - US$319 million (£200 million) listed bonds due in 2012 with a carrying amount net of costs, of
US$311 million (£195 million). Interest is payable at 8.75% per annum. During the year ended
31 March 2009, bonds with a par value, net of costs, of US$57 million (£36 million) were re-issued by
Cable & Wireless Group for US$54 million (£34 million) net proceeds. During the year ended

million) of these bonds at an average price of 197.3 cents (104.9 pence).

    - US$319 million (£200 million) listed bonds due in 2019 with a carrying amount, net of costs, of
US$234 million (£147 million). Interest is payable at 8.625% per annum. During the year ended
31 March 2008, the Cable & Wireless Group repurchased but did not cancel US$64 million (£32
million) of these bonds at an average price of 204.6 cents (102.1 pence).

Various US dollar-based loans of approximately US$179 million were held by various subsidiaries across the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group at 30 September 2009. In 2008/9, interest on these loans ranged from
2% and 6.5%. The loans are repayable over a period up to 2013.

In May 2008, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group entered into a three year bank facility of US$415
million, which was drawn down in full during the year ended 31 March 2009 and was repaid in full on
29 January 2010.

In 2008/9, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group also arranged a US$42 million (£29 million) financing
secured by the 2019 bonds held by Cable & Wireless Communications Group. This loan is repayable in February
2012.

**_Convertible Bonds_**

On 24 November 2009, Cable and Wireless plc (the Initial Issuer) issued £230 million convertible bonds due
2014 (the Convertible Bonds).

The Convertible Bonds are senior debt obligations of Cable and Wireless plc and are convertible into fully paid
ordinary shares of Cable and Wireless plc. Upon Worldwide Admission, subject to the satisfaction of the
substitution conditions described below prior to Worldwide Admission and the execution of the Worldwide
Substitution Deed and, unless previously converted, redeemed or purchased and cancelled, the Convertible
Bonds become debt obligations of Cable & Wireless Worldwide and convertible into fully paid ordinary shares
of Cable & Wireless Worldwide.

The conditions for the substitution of Cable & Wireless Worldwide as the principal debtor under the Convertible
Bonds upon Worldwide Admission require that a certificate signed by two directors of Cable & Wireless
Worldwide (the Substitution Compliance Certificate) is delivered to the bond trustee on the business day in
London prior to the date of Worldwide Admission, certifying that the (i) total net debt for the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group equals no more than £225 million; (ii) total secured bank debt for the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group equals no more than £200 million; (iii) the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has freely
available, uncommitted and unsecured cash and cash equivalents and available credit facilities of not less than
£200 million; and (iv) Cable & Wireless Worldwide is the ultimate holding company of the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group.

The Demerger is conditional upon the delivery by Cable & Wireless Worldwide to the bond trustee of the
Substitution Compliance Certificate. Cable & Wireless Communications will, shortly before Demerger, transfer
the proceeds of the Convertible Bonds to Cable & Wireless Worldwide, thereby allowing Cable & Wireless
Worldwide to deliver the Substitution Compliance Certificate to the bond trustee prior to the Demerger. Pursuant
to the terms of the Separation Agreement, the execution by Cable & Wireless Communications and Cable &
Wireless Worldwide of the Worldwide Substitution Deed which effects the substitution of Cable & Wireless
Worldwide as principal debtor in respect of the Convertible Bonds, will take place no later than immediately
prior to the Worldwide Admission in consideration for, and subject to, Cable & Wireless Communications
having, shortly before Demerger (as described above), transferred such proceeds to Cable & Wireless
Worldwide. Therefore, all necessary conditions for the substitution of Cable & Wireless Worldwide as principal
debtor under the Convertible Bonds, subject only to Worldwide Admission taking place, will have been met, de
_facto, prior to Worldwide Admission._

88


-----

In the event that the conditions to transfer the Convertible Bonds to Cable & Wireless Worldwide plc are not met
or the Demerger does not otherwise complete, Cable and Wireless plc (or, subject to the fulfilment of certain
conditions, Cable & Wireless Communications) shall remain principal debtor under the Convertible Bonds and
the Convertible Bond proceeds will be returned to the principal debtor thereunder. The principal debtor under the
Convertible Bonds from time to time is referred to below as the Convertible Issuer.

The Convertible Bonds carry a coupon from and including 24 November 2009 of 5.75% per annum payable
semi-annually in arrears in equal instalments on 30 June and 30 December in each year, with a long first coupon
on 30 June 2010 of £3,440.57 per £100,000 principal amount of the Convertible Bonds and a short last coupon on
the maturity date of £2,309.43 per £100,000 principal amount of the Convertible Bonds, in each case, in respect
of each Convertible Bond. The conversion price is £1.841 per £100,000 principal amount of the Convertible
Bonds and is subject to adjustment from the issue date of the Convertible Bonds. Unless previously redeemed,
converted or purchased and cancelled, the Convertible Bonds will be redeemed on 24 November 2014 at their
principal amount together with accrued (but unpaid) interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption.

The Convertible Bonds and the trust deed (the Convertible Trust Deed) are governed by English law. An
application will be made by the Convertible Issuer for the Convertible Bonds to be admitted to listing on the
Official List of the UK Listing Authority and admitted to trading on the Professional Securities Market of the
London Stock Exchange by no later than 30 June 2010.

**_Secured £29 million (US$42 million) loan facility_**

Cable and Wireless plc has obtained an aggregate £29 million loan facility secured by the sterling-denominated
bonds due in 2019 held by Cable and Wireless plc. Cable and Wireless plc is required to repay this loan facility
together with accrued but unpaid interest, in February 2012. Upon repayment, the creditor will deliver to Cable
and Wireless plc (or its successor) such sterling-denominated bonds (or if such bonds have been redeemed, the
redemption proceeds of such bonds). (See Note 27 to the historical financial information of Cable & Wireless
Communications Group in “Historical Financial Information of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group”
on page F-43 of this documents).

See also “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements”.

**CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s historical financial information as of and for the years ended
31 March 2009, 2008 and 2007 have been prepared under IFRS (as adopted by the European Union, and with
some exceptions common to historical financial information). The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with IFRS (as adopted by the European Union, and with some exceptions common to historical
financial information) requires the use of accounting estimates and assumptions. It also requires management to
exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s accounting
policies. The Directors consider that of its significant IFRS accounting policies, the following are important to
the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s financial condition and results and involve a higher degree of
judgement and complexity, and are therefore considered critical. A full list of critical assumptions is included in
“Historical Financial Information of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group”, a selection of which are
presented below.

**Revenue recognition: Revenue, which excludes discounts, value added tax or other sales taxes, represents the**
amount receivable in respect of services provided to customers and is accounted for on the accruals basis to
match revenue with the provision of service. Revenue is recognised monthly as services are provided. Revenue in
respect of services invoiced in advance is deferred and recognised on provision of the services. Revenue in
respect of unbilled services is accrued.

Judgement is required in assessing the application of these principles and the specific guidance in respect of the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s revenue, including the presentation of revenue as principal or as
agent in respect of income received from transmission of content provided by third parties.

**LTIP: The LTIP creates a reward pool over a five year period from 1 April 2006 (or until a vesting event, if**
earlier) depending on the extent to which the business has grown in value from its base valuation at the start of
the period (this period was changed from four to five years in July 2009).

Base valuations are adjusted over the performance period (i) to reflect additional capital notionally treated as
borrowed by the business, (ii) to reflect capital notionally treated as returned by the business, and (iii) increased
by the notional weighted average cost of capital of the business (which will be at least 8% per annum

89


-----

compounded). If the business’ value is lower than its adjusted base valuation at the end of the performance
period, there will be no reward pool. To the extent that the business’ value exceeds its adjusted base valuation at
the end of the performance period, 10% of the excess growth in value goes into the reward pool.

Part of the reward pool was payable to participants at the end of year three (31 March 2009), with a portion
payable (less payments made at end of year three) to participants at the end of year four (31 March 2010) and the
balance in full at the end of year five (31 March 2011). Measurement of the size of the reward pool is carried out
every six months to correspond with the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s accounting periods.
However, apart from good leavers, nothing vests to the participants until the end of year three. In the event of a
potential payment to an individual in excess of US$31 million, the deferral period would be extended until
31 March 2012 or for a period of up to one year following a vesting event, if earlier.

The LTIP charge calculated in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits requires estimation of the valuation of
the Cable & Wireless Communications Group to determine the obligation for the LTIP. The estimates require the
use of a number of assumptions which, by their nature, are subjective.

**Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets: The directors of the Cable & Wireless**
Communications Group assess the impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (excluding
goodwill) whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable
or otherwise as required by accounting standards. Factors that are considered important and which could trigger
an impairment review include the following:

    - Obsolescence or physical damage;

    - Significant changes in technology and regulatory environments;

    - Significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;

    - Significant changes in the use of its assets or the strategy for its overall business;

    - Significant negative industry or economic trends; and

    - Significant decline in its stock price for a sustained period and its market capitalisation relative to net
book value.

In addition, the directors of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group test goodwill, which is not amortised,
at least annually for impairment.

The identification of impairment indicators, the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of the
recoverable amount for assets or cash generating units requires significant judgement concerning the
identification and validation of impairment indicators, the timing and amount of expected cash flows and
applicable discount rates.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group determines any impairment by comparing the carrying values of
each of its cash generating units to their recoverable amounts which is the higher of net realisable value and the
value in use. Net realisable value represents market value in an active market less the cost to sell. Value in use is
determined by discounting future cash flows arising from the asset (or the cash generating unit to which it refers).
Future cash flows are determined with reference to the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’ own
projections using discount rates which represent the estimated weighted average cost of capital for the respective
businesses.

**DIVIDEND POLICY AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE**

**Dividend policy**

Cable and Wireless plc previously announced that, subject to trading performance in the second half of 2009/10,
it intends to recommend a final dividend of 6.34 pence per Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Share, resulting in a
2009/10 total dividend of 9.50 pence per Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Share. Payment of this final dividend
is expected to be apportioned between each of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group and the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group.

Subject to completion of the Demerger, shareholder approval, availability of sufficient distributable reserves,
general market conditions and financial and trading performance, the Cable & Wireless Communications Board
has confirmed that the dividend expected to be payable by it in August 2010 in respect of 2009/10 will be 3.34
pence per Cable & Wireless Communications Ordinary Share.

90


-----

For 2010/11 onward, dividends payable by Cable & Wireless Communications will be declared in US dollars, in
line with the intended post-Demerger reporting currency of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group. Such
dividends will be payable in sterling or, at the election of the relevant shareholder, in US dollars. Accordingly,
the actual sterling amount of the dividend payable by Cable & Wireless Communications from time to time will
be based on the sterling/US dollar exchange rate in effect on a date chosen by the directors of Cable & Wireless
Communications nearer to the relevant dividend payment date.

For 2010/11, the Cable & Wireless Communications Board has confirmed that, subject to shareholder approval,
availability of sufficient distributable reserves, general market conditions and financial and trading performance,
the aggregate dividend expected to be payable by it will be 8.00 US cents per Cable & Wireless Communications
Ordinary Share, equivalent to approximately 5.00 pence per Cable & Wireless Communications Ordinary Share
(subject to movements in the sterling/US dollar exchange rate).

Beyond 2010/11, the Cable & Wireless Communications Board intends to pursue a policy of dividend growth
that reflects the underlying earnings and cash flow of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group. The Cable
& Wireless Communications Board expects the structure of the dividends to be split approximately one third as
an interim dividend and approximately two thirds as a final dividend.

**Capital Structure**

**_Cable & Wireless Communications Group_**

At Demerger, both the Cable & Wireless Communications Group and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group
will have sufficient cash and credit lines to support their businesses and to meet at least three years of projected
financing and refinancing needs post-Demerger, with good liquidity during this period.

At Demerger, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group is expected to have net debt representing
approximately 0.8 times, on a consolidated basis, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s 2009/10
EBITDA (excluding exceptional items) guidance of US$880 – US$900 million and approximately 1.2 times on a
proportionate ownership basis. This guidance does not include US$42 million of Central operations costs. The
Cable & Wireless Communications Group has signed new three year facilities totalling US$500 million
(comprising a US$400 million revolving credit facility and a US$100 million term loan) with margins of between
3.25% and 4.00% over LIBOR with a group of leading banks. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group has
repaid and/or cancelled its previously existing US$415 million facility and other undrawn facilities on or prior to
29 January 2010. At Demerger, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group debt will, in addition to the Notes,
also include the existing Cable and Wireless plc sterling bonds due in 2012 (£195 million, approximately
US$311 million as of 30 September 2009), Cable & Wireless International Finance B.V.’s sterling bonds due in
2019 (£147 million, approximately US$234 million as of 30 September 2009) and a Cable and Wireless plc
secured financing of £29 million as of 30 September 2009 (approximately US$42 million) as well as other debt
held in Cable & Wireless Communications’s local operations. The total amount of new and replacement
Demerger financing for the Cable & Wireless Communications Group will be US$1 billion. All Cable &
Wireless Communications Group financing described above, including the Notes, will remain with the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group after the Demerger.

**_Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group_**

At Demerger, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group will have negligible net debt, no material loans maturing
within three years and will have sufficient liquidity to cover its seasonal working capital requirements and invest
in its business to support customer growth during this period.

Upon Worldwide Admission, the Convertible Bonds issued by Cable and Wireless plc in November 2009 become
obligations of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group and, shortly before Demerger, the Convertible Bonds net
proceeds will be transferred to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group
has also agreed an amendment to its existing £200 million secured credit facility which, upon Worldwide
Admission, will be increased to a three year £300 million secured credit facility. This amended credit facility is
provided by a group of leading banks and carries a margin over LIBOR of 3.50%. As a result of the receipt of the
Convertible Bond net proceeds and the credit facility, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group will have cash and
available credit of approximately £500 million. Post-Demerger, Cable and Wireless plc will transfer £78 million
cash to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group to fund the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s share of the
2009/10 final dividend. Further information on the Convertible Bonds and the credit facility is provided in the
section entitled “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Convertible Bonds”.

**PENSIONS**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group operates defined benefit and defined contribution pension
schemes for its current and former UK and overseas employees.

**_Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund_**

In the United Kingdom, Cable and Wireless plc is the principal employer of the Cable & Wireless
Superannuation Fund, a multi-employer pension scheme that provides defined benefit and defined contribution
pension benefits for certain current and former employees of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group. The
Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund has been closed to new defined benefit members since 1998. The
Lifetime Benefits Plan is a section of the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund that provides defined
contribution benefits to members.

The assets of the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund are held by a trustee board, Cable & Wireless Pension
Trustee Limited, separately from the Cable & Wireless Communications Group. The trustee has the power to
trigger the winding-up of the Fund if it resolves that it is in the best interests of the Fund members as a whole. If
the trustee uses this power, the participating employers would become liable by statute to make contributions to
the pension scheme to remove any deficit calculated on the conservative, buy-out basis, enabling the trustee of
the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund to purchase individual annuity policies for all members of the Cable
& Wireless Superannuation Fund.

Following Demerger, current members of the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund who are employed in the
business of Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group will accrue benefits in the Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Retirement Plan on the same basis as applied to them under the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund. The
Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund will remain in the Cable & Wireless Communications Group.

The latest full actuarial valuation of the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund was carried out as at 31 March
2007 by independent actuaries. On an ongoing basis, there was a deficit of £15 million. The ongoing funding
position is expected to have significantly deteriorated since the 31 March 2007 valuation. On an IAS 19 basis, at
30 September 2009, the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund had a deficit of £305 million. Following the
Demerger and the bulk transfer of assets and liabilities, the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund is expected to
have a deficit. If the bulk transfer had been effected at 30 September 2009, it is expected that the pension deficit
allocated to the Cable & Wireless Communications Group would have been approximately half of the Cable &
Wireless Superannuation Fund deficit.

During 2008, the trustee of the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund agreed an insurance buy-in of the UK
pensioner liabilities, approximately half of the total liabilities, with Prudential Insurance. The buy-in involved the
purchase of a bulk annuity policy by the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund under which Prudential
Insurance assumed responsibility for the benefits payable to the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund’s UK
pensioners with effect from 1 August 2008. These pensioner liabilities and the matching annuity policy remain
with the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund. Following Demerger, the buy-in policy will be split between
the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund and the newly-established Cable & Wireless Worldwide Retirement
Plan in accordance with the allocation of the corresponding members.

**_Bulk transfer to Cable & Wireless Worldwide_**

The key commercial terms and legal principles of the bulk transfer are included in a binding heads of terms
agreement between Cable and Wireless plc, Cable & Wireless Worldwide Services Limited and the trustee of the
Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund. Before Demerger, the same parties and the trustee of the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Retirement Plan will enter into a Pensions Agreement which sets out the full terms of the
bulk transfer.

Following the Demerger, the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund will remain in the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group. On or soon after Demerger, there will be a bulk transfer of approximately half of the
assets and liabilities of the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund to the newly-established Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Retirement Plan in respect of current and former employees of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group. The membership will be split on the basis of the last known employer of each member. This split will
result in approximately 6,300 defined benefit members remaining with the Cable & Wireless Superannuation
Fund and approximately 8,700 defined benefit members moving to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Retirement
Plan.

92


-----

**_Funding of the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund_**

As a result of the Demerger, the number of active and deferred members remaining in the Cable & Wireless
Superannuation Fund will be significantly reduced, which will reduce the average duration of the Cable &
Wireless Superannuation Fund’s liabilities. As a result Cable & Wireless Communications has agreed with the
trustee of the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund a further de-risking of the Cable & Wireless
Superannuation Fund’s investment strategy over the next ten years. The estimated impact of this de-risking on
the valuation of the liabilities is £25 million. Cable & Wireless Communications has agreed to make a special
contribution of this amount on or shortly after Demerger.

The next triennial valuation of the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund is due as at 31 March 2010. Cable and
Wireless plc has agreed pursuant to the pensions heads of terms that the funding for any deficit arising from that
valuation will not be longer than six years from the valuation date based on its current financial projections and
the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund’s financial position at 30 September 2009. It has also been agreed
that the interim funding plan agreed between Cable and Wireless plc and the trustee of the Cable & Wireless
Superannuation Fund in July 2009 will be split and two new interim funding plans will be established, one for the
Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund and one for the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Retirement Plan. Pursuant
to the Cable & Wireless Communications agreement, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group will make
payments of £9 million in October 2010 and £20 million in April 2011 to the residual Cable & Wireless
Superannuation Fund.

A new contingent funding agreement will also be entered into with the trustee of the Cable & Wireless
Superannuation Fund, providing security of £100 million by way of escrow account or letter of credit in certain
circumstances, based on agreed financial and business triggers. The existing contingent funding agreement will
cease to apply on Demerger.

In addition, Cable & Wireless Communications and certain other Cable & Wireless Communications Group
companies have agreed to guarantee the pension obligations of the principal employer of the Cable & Wireless
Superannuation Fund.

**_Clearance from the Pensions Regulator_**

A number of companies and directors within the Cable & Wireless Communications Group have sought
clearance from the Pensions Regulator in respect of the Demerger and bulk transfer of pensions assets and
liabilities from the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund such that the Pensions Regulator would consider that
it was not reasonable in the circumstances of the Demerger to impose any liability on those applicants under a
contribution notice or financial support direction under the Pensions Act 2004 in respect of the Cable & Wireless
Superannuation Fund and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Retirement Plan.

Clearance is expected to be granted on the basis that the bulk transfer from the Cable & Wireless Superannuation
Fund and the other terms of the heads of terms appropriately address the effect of the Demerger on the Cable &
Wireless Superannuation Fund and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Retirement Plan.

**_Merchant Navy officers pension fund (MNOPF)_**

Companies within the Cable & Wireless Communications Group have previously participated in the MNOPF.
All Cable & Wireless Communications Group companies have since ceased to participate in the MNOPF, but
following a court judgment on the nature of the MNOPF rules, Cable and Wireless plc may be liable for future
contributions to fund a portion of any future MNOPF funding deficit. Currently, the estimated outflow for this
potential liability is not expected to have a significant adverse impact on the financial position of the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group.

**_Overseas Schemes_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group also operates defined benefit pension arrangements in Macau,
Jamaica, Barbados and Guernsey as well as having unfunded liabilities in the United Kingdom relating to
pension provisions for former directors and other senior employees in respect of their earnings in excess of the
previous Inland Revenue salary cap.

**CURRENT TRADING, TRENDS AND PROSPECTS**

Below is an extract from Cable and Wireless plc’s 2 February 2010 trading update covering Cable and Wireless
plc, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group:

_“Cable and Wireless plc confirms the 2009/10 EBITDA guidance given on 5 November 2009: Worldwide_
_continues to expect that its 2009/10 EBITDA will be approximately £430 million; Communications continues to_
_expect that its 2009/10 EBITDA will be in a range of approximately US$880 million to US$900 million; and_
_Central costs are still expected to be approximately £28 million._

_The costs and expenses related to demerger are expected to be approximately £22 million, to be shared_
_approximately £12 million by Cable & Wireless Communications and approximately £10 million by Cable &_
_Wireless Worldwide._

**_Communications_**

_Communications continues to trade in the EBITDA range of US$880 million to US$900 million. It now expects_
_2009/10 capital expenditure to be lower than our guidance of US$325 million. Exceptional costs are expected to_
_be in line with our November 2009 guidance before any costs arising from the demerger._

_Trading continues to be challenging within the Caribbean. Whilst we are holding market share, lower usage by_
_customers and more aggressive price promotions means that revenue and EBITDA continue to trend in line with_
_the first half of 2009/10. We believe that the market conditions within the Caribbean region will remain difficult_
_through the remainder of this year and into next._

_Trading in our other three businesses continues to progress satisfactorily. In Panama, we maintained mobile_
_market share and are starting to see more government enterprise projects. Trading continues to be in line with_
_performance at the half year as we maintained discipline around operating costs. The economy in Macau has_

94


-----

_benefited in the last quarter from increased tourist numbers and a resumption of a number of the hotel and_
_casino projects. However, we would not expect the resumption of economic growth to fully filter through to our_
_results during this financial year. Monaco & Islands has seen some impact in the third quarter from a more_
_competitive trading environment in Guernsey, but this has been offset by better trading in the Maldives._

**_Worldwide_**

_Worldwide continues to make excellent progress with strong new contract wins in the third quarter. Worldwide_
_expects to achieve its EBITDA and operating cash flow guidance for 2009/10, with EBITDA of approximately_
_£430 million, capital expenditure of approximately £280 million and exceptional costs (cash and P&L) of_
_approximately £70 million and £55 million respectively before any costs arising from the demerger._

_In the third quarter we saw strong sales of our strategic product set—Data, IP and Hosting—up more than 40%_
_on the same period last year. These are long term contracts and can take nine months or more to convert into_
_revenue. The recessionary effects that we saw earlier in the year are showing some signs of abating; for example_
_voice minutes have stabilised and we have seen the anticipated improvement in the levels of project work. In the_
_second half, revenue will reflect the previously noted regulatory price changes which will have a minimal effect_
_on our margins. Gross margin continues to grow in line with our expectations._

_The integration of Thus continues to make good progress and we are on track to deliver the expected synergies of_
_£104 million by 2011/12.”_

**PROFIT FORECAST**

**Profit forecasts for each of Cable and Wireless plc, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group, the Cable &**
**Wireless Communications Group and the Central operations of the Cable and Wireless Group for the year**
**ending 31 March 2010**

On 5 November 2009, Cable and Wireless plc published its Interim Results for the six months ended 30 September
2009. The Interim Results contained the following statements in respect of the Cable & Wireless Group:

_“We have updated our Group outlook for the poor economic environment in the Caribbean as well as the_
_consolidation of Dhiraagu, our business in the Maldives, in the second half._

**_Cable & Wireless Communications Group_**

_In May 2009, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group[*]_ _set guidance at approximately US$935 million_
_based on our planning exchange rates and the view then prevailing of the economic backdrop. Since the_
_summer we’ve seen further deterioration in Caribbean trading conditions with no immediate signs of_
_improvement and the IMF has recently forecast GDP will decline across the region for this year and next._
_Within our other markets, despite a more difficult first quarter for Panama and Macau, the second quarter_
_showed more promise and we remain on track in Panama, Macau and Monaco & Islands. As a_
_consequence, we are now expecting the Cable & Wireless Communications Group EBITDA for the second_
_half to be around the same level as the first, excluding the consolidation of the Maldives, and we are_
_revising our Cable & Wireless Communications Group 2009/10 EBITDA guidance to a range of US$880_
_million—US$900 million, including the Maldives._

**_Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group_**

_With EBITDA growth of 44% in the first half, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group business is_
_performing well as we continue to increase margin from our strategic product set and reduce costs in the_
_face of a global recession which has led to lower traditional voice revenue and less discretionary project_
_work. We continue to expect that the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group 2009/10 EBITDA will be_
_approximately £430 million._

_We have reclassified £20 million of cost to achieve the Thus synergies from exceptionals to capital_
_expenditure, reflecting a change in how the costs are expected to arise. We have reduced our expected_
_Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group P&L exceptional costs for 2009/10 by £15 million to £55 million,_
_reflecting the reclassification of Thus costs to achieve, partially offset by bringing forward £5 million of_
_exceptional restructuring costs from 2010/11. Overall, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s cash_
_guidance remains unchanged.”_

at the date of the Interim Results.

The statements above regarding post-exceptional EBITDA (and excluding Demerger costs) in 2009/2010 for
each of Cable & Wireless Communications Group, Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group, the Central operations
of the Cable & Wireless Group and Cable & Wireless Group represent profit forecasts under the Prospectus
Rules. The Directors have considered the above statements and continue to believe that they are valid based on
the assumptions below.

The Directors do not expect the full year tax profile for each of Cable & Wireless Communications Group,
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group and the Cable & Wireless Group to be materially different from that set out
in the income statements for each of Cable & Wireless Communications Group, Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group and the Cable & Wireless Group for the six months ended 30 September 2009, included in the section
entitled “Historical Financial Information of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group” and in “Annex A—
_Historical Financial Information of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group”._

**Basis of Preparation**

The Directors confirm that the profit forecasts described above (the Profit Forecasts) have been properly
compiled on the basis of the assumptions stated below and using accounting policies which are in accordance
with IFRS as adopted in the EU and consistent with those adopted by Cable & Wireless Communications and
Cable & Wireless in the preparation of the accounts included in “Historical Financial Information of the
_Cable & Wireless Communications Group” of this document._

The Profit Forecasts for Cable & Wireless Communications Group and the Central operations of the Cable &
Wireless Group are based upon the unaudited consolidated results for the six months ended 30 September 2009
(set out in “Cable & Wireless Communications Group Operating and Financial Review” of this document), the
results shown by unaudited management accounts for the three months ended 31 December 2009 and the Cable
& Wireless Communications Directors’ forecast of the results for the three month period ending 31 March 2010.

The Profit Forecast for the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group is based upon the audited results for the six
months ended 30 September 2009 set out in “Annex A—Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group Operating and
_Financial Review”, the results shown by unaudited management accounts for the three months ended 31_
December 2009 and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide directors’ forecast of the results for the three month period
ending 31 March 2010.

The Profit Forecast for the Cable & Wireless Group is based upon the unaudited consolidated results for the six
months ended 30 September 2009 (set out in “Cable & Wireless Communications Group Operating and
_Financial Review” of this document), the results shown by unaudited management accounts for the three months_
ended 31 December 2009 and the Cable & Wireless Communications and Cable & Wireless Worldwide
directors’ forecast of the results for the three month period ending 31 March 2010.

The Profit Forecast for the Cable & Wireless Group has been prepared on the basis that the Cable & Wireless
Group comprises the Cable & Wireless Communications Group, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group and
Central operations for the full 12 month period ending 31 March 2010. However, the Demerger is expected to
complete on or about 26 March 2010. If the Demerger completes before 31 March 2010, the annual reported

96


-----

results of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group for the year ending 31 March 2010 will not include the
trading of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group for the period following completion of the Demerger and the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group will be treated as a discontinued operation. The Directors have not restated
the Cable & Wireless Group Profit Forecast for the exclusion of the trading of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group for the 5 day period between the expected completion of the Demerger and 31 March 2010 as they do not
consider that this is material to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group Profit Forecast.

Post-exceptional EBITDA represents earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, LTIP credit/
charge and net other operating income/expense.

The Profit Forecasts do not include any costs related to the Demerger.

The Profit Forecasts are stated on the basis of the EBITDA after exceptional items rather than profit before tax
due to the extent of existing guidance which has been provided to the market by Cable and Wireless plc on both
EBITDA and exceptional items. Guidance on the EBITDA performance of each of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group, the Central operations of the Cable & Wireless
Group and the Cable & Wireless Group has been provided for a number of years as it represents the measure on
which management consistently assess the performance of the business and it is also the measure on which both
shareholders and analysts attach greatest significance. During the course of 2009, Cable and Wireless plc also
provided guidance on the level of exceptional items in each of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group, the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group, the Central operations of the Cable & Wireless Group and the Cable &
Wireless Group. Accordingly, the Cable & Wireless Communications Directors consider EBITDA after
exceptional items to be the most appropriate basis to present the Profit Forecasts.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s Profit Forecast has been prepared using the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s 2009/10 planning exchange rates, the principal rates used are:

US dollar : sterling . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.5000

**OVERVIEW**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group (formerly known as Cable & Wireless International (CWI)),
headquartered in London, England, owns and operates full-service telecommunications businesses providing
mobile, broadband and domestic and international fixed line services to consumers, small and medium-sized
enterprises, corporate customers (including other carriers) and governments. The Cable & Wireless
Communications Group is the market leading telecommunications provider in the majority of its markets. The
business is managed as four regional operations—the Caribbean, Panama, Macau and Monaco & Islands—each
of which is profitable and cash generative in its own right. These four regional operations span 38 countries
through 33 subsidiaries and five joint ventures, with Panama, Macau, Jamaica, the Maldives and Monaco being
the main markets by revenue. The ownership of these businesses varies—some are wholly owned and others are
partly owned with either public, governmental or corporate partners.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group is the only full service telecommunications provider in the
majority of its markets. It is the market leader in 19 out of 27 mobile markets in which it competes, 25 out of 34
broadband markets in which it competes and 25 out of 27 fixed line markets in which it competes. As at
30 September 2009, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group, through its subsidiaries and joint ventures,
provided services to approximately 8.3 million mobile, 0.6 million broadband and 1.8 million fixed line
customers.

Following the Demerger, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group will comprise Cable & Wireless
Communications and the entities forming the Cable and Wireless Group, other than those entities comprising the
demerged Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group. Principally, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group will
comprise the Cable & Wireless Communications Group businesses and the Central operations of the Cable &
Wireless Group.

**HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT**

Cable & Wireless is one of the world’s leading international communications companies. For more than 130
years Cable & Wireless has provided telecommunications services, networks and equipment to business,
government and residential customers around the world. Cable & Wireless traces its history to a number of
British telegraph companies founded by Sir John Pender in the 1860s. In 1866, a Pender-led consortium laid the
first submarine cable across the Atlantic Ocean using Brunel’s ship, the “Great Eastern”. The “Great Eastern”
also laid the cable from Bombay to Porthcurno in the far south west of England in 1870, the first cable into what
subsequently became, for a period, the biggest cable station in the world. Following this success, further
submarine cables were laid from the United Kingdom to the Caribbean, Asia, Australia and the United States.

98


-----

With the development of wireless telegraphy, the Eastern and Associated Telegraph Company expanded its
interests by merging with the Wireless Telegraph Company founded by Marconi in 1929 to form the Imperial
and International Communications Company. This merger led to the formation of the biggest wireless and cable
company in the world and the company was renamed Cable & Wireless Limited in 1934.

During World War II, Cable & Wireless’s communications network played a vital strategic role and following
the war, the company was nationalised, acknowledging the vital importance of the international communications
infrastructure. Cable & Wireless became the international communications business of the British Post Office.

Cable and Wireless plc was one of the first privatisations of the Thatcher government with its initial sale of 49%
of Cable & Wireless in 1981. The remaining 51% was offered to the public in two tranches in 1983 and 1985. In
1981, Mercury Communications was created within the Cable & Wireless Group as a competitor to BT to
provide fixed line telecommunications services in the United Kingdom. In 1993, One2One, a Mercury
Communications division, launched mobile communications to the UK consumer market. In 1997, Mercury
merged with several UK telecommunications operators and was renamed Cable & Wireless Communications
(CW Communications); Cable & Wireless owned a 53% stake in CW Communications. Following the Mercury
merger, Cable & Wireless initiated a significant disposal programme, which included the following disposals: the
Cable & Wireless Group’s stake in One2One to Deutsche Telekom in 1999, its CW Communications consumer
operations stake to NTL in 2000, its Hong Kong Telecom stake to PCCW in 2000 and its Australian Optus stake
to Singapore Telecom in 2001. At the same time, the Cable & Wireless Group began developing its business
around a global IP network with a strategy to sell global IP services and build its hosting expertise.

In 2003, Sir Richard Lapthorne was appointed as Chairman to lead a turnaround of the business following a
downturn in financial performance. This turnaround included resolving a significant tax issue relating to its
disposal of the Cable & Wireless Group’s stake in One2One, the sale of the Japanese business and the exit from
the loss-making US operations. In 2004, Cable & Wireless successfully competed for the opportunity to purchase
a stake in Monaco Telecom. The following year, in a transformational move, Cable & Wireless bought Energis,
an acquisition which strengthened Cable & Wireless’ position in the United Kingdom. In 2006, Cable & Wireless
internally re-structured into two standalone divisions—Cable & Wireless International (since renamed the Cable
& Wireless Communications Group) and Cable & Wireless Europe, Asia & US (EAUS) (since renamed the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group).

In 2008, Cable & Wireless completed the purchase of THUS Group plc, a UK telecommunications group. The
integration of Thus is ongoing and a new company, Thus Limited, has been set up as a stand-alone business
within the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group focused on offering a full suite of advanced business
communications to small and medium sized enterprises.

In November 2009, the Cable and Wireless plc Board announced its intention to separate the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group, reflecting its belief that the businesses had
reached a position where they would deliver increased value to shareholders as independently listed companies.
The separation is the culmination of work which began in April 2006, when Cable and Wireless plc created two
largely distinct operating units under the Cable and Wireless plc umbrella to reflect their differing characteristics
and the establishment of clear strategies for both. As a result of the significant progress made since then, the
Cable and Wireless plc Board considers that the two businesses have now put in place the necessary
arrangements to operate as independent, publicly-quoted businesses.

The Cable and Wireless plc Board believes that the separation will deliver further value for shareholders by:

    - allowing the Cable & Wireless Communications Group and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group to
pursue their strategies independently with greater flexibility over management of resources and
opportunities;

    - creating two separately listed companies with distinct investment profiles and clear market valuations;

    - sharpening management focus further, helping the two businesses maximise their performance; and

    - providing a transparent capital structure and an efficient balance sheet for each business.

**MARKET OVERVIEW**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group operates in 38 countries, with Panama, Macau, Jamaica, the
Maldives and Monaco currently being the main markets by revenue, and offers mobile, broadband, domestic and
international fixed line services, as well as enterprise services. The telecommunications markets in the countries

99


-----

in which it operates differ in terms of technological development and customer penetration for each product and
service. For example, Macau is a market with a high level of mobile penetration at approximately 183% as at
30 September 2009, and operates leading technologies (including third-generation (3G) mobile services which
enable high-speed Internet connections via a mobile device, such as a phone or a USB dongle). The broadband
markets in Panama and some parts of the Caribbean, on the other hand, are examples of early stage markets, with
low broadband penetration.

Highly-penetrated markets require provision of new services or offers to maintain or grow average revenue per
user (ARPU) and careful management of operating costs to maintain or improve margins. Lower-penetrated
markets offer growth opportunities through customer acquisition and overall market growth. The Cable &
Wireless Communications Board believes it has a balanced mix of highly and lower-penetrated markets.

The economies of the countries in which the Cable & Wireless Communications Group operates also range from
developing to highly-developed. Highly-developed markets such as Macau, Monaco, the British Virgin Islands (BVI)
and the Channel Islands tend to have high levels of income per capita. Developing markets such as St Vincent & the
Grenadines, Jamaica and those in West Africa have lower levels of income per capita. While developing markets
typically offer further growth opportunities through overall market growth potential, they are often more sensitive to
fluctuations in general economic conditions and require the Cable & Wireless Communications Group to adopt
specific approaches, such as emphasis on pre-pay arrangements to mitigate customer risk.

Many of the economies in which the Cable & Wireless Communications Group operates are dependent on
tourism. Other economic drivers within the business include offshore finance (the BVI, the Cayman Islands,
Bermuda, Turks & Caicos, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands), insurance and reinsurance (Bermuda),
international transport (Panama) and gaming and leisure (Macau and the Channel Islands).

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group not only expects to benefit from long-term growth trends in local
economies, but also from the essential nature of communications services in the everyday lives of its customers.
The rapid growth in business and personal communications services available over mobile and broadband
technologies is also a key driver in the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business.

The development of new products and services (particularly in mobile and mobile broadband) has created new
revenue streams for telecommunications providers, and has driven increased demand for network capacity, or
bandwidth, to deliver the new services. Competition for customers drives telecommunications companies to
invest in capacity and new technology to provide these services. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group
commits capital expenditure each year to the development of its network and technologies, enabling it to bring a
wide range of services to its customers.

The emergence of specialist enterprise telecommunications services for large organisations, such as companies
and government bodies, is also a developing market for the Cable & Wireless Communications Group, for
example in Panama and Macau.

**_Competitive landscape_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group is a strong competitor in most of its markets. It is the market leader
in 19 out of the 27 mobile markets in which it competes and in 25 out of 34 broadband markets. It is also the market
leader in 25 out of 27 fixed line markets. As at 30 September 2009, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group,
through its subsidiaries and joint ventures provided services to approximately 8.3 million mobile, 0.6 million
broadband and 1.8 million fixed line customers.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group has adapted its business model and strategy to address
liberalisation in its markets to ensure it can continue to provide customers with the best products and services
available in each territory. Competitors tend to be local or regional in nature, such as Jersey Telecom in the
Channel Islands, Bharti-Airtel in the Channel Islands and Seychelles or Digicel in the Caribbean and Panama.
Unlike many of its competitors, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group can bring global scale and
experience to bear in these markets as well as the competitive advantage of bundled propositions, where
permitted by law, enabled by its wider range of network platforms. It competes against major global
telecommunications companies in certain of its markets, such as Telefonica (Movistar) and America Movil in
Panama and SFR in Monaco.

The Board believes that it is essential that there is a level competitive playing field both for existing operators
and new entrants. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group, through its subsidiaries has worked with local
regulators to ensure fair and efficient regulation in the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s markets.

Further information on the regulatory environment in which the Cable & Wireless Communications Group
operates is set out in the section entitled “—Regulatory Overview”.

**STRENGTHS**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group has significant competitive strengths and the Board believes it is
well positioned to deliver strong cash generation and long-term earnings growth to create further shareholder
value. These competitive strengths include:

**_Market leadership_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group is the market leader in the majority of its markets and the primary
challenger in others. It is the market leader in 19 out of 27 markets in mobile, 25 out of 34 markets in broadband
and 25 out of 27 markets in fixed line services. Among its main markets by revenue, Cable & Wireless
Communications Group is the market leader in all services in Panama, Macau, Monaco and the Maldives.

**_Cable & Wireless Communications is an integrated, full service provider_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group provides fixed, broadband and mobile services in the majority of
its markets, and is broadening its proposition into entertainment (such as pay-TV) and enterprise services. In
several markets, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group is the only full service telecommunications
provider including in Panama, Macau, Monaco, the Seychelles, the Maldives and several countries in the
Caribbean. In these markets, its major competitors do not provide all three of mobile, broadband and fixed line
services. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s integrated capability allows it to provide ‘bundled’
offers to its customers, under which they are able to buy all telecommunications needs from one provider,
provided it is permitted by law or regulation. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group believes this
‘bundled’ product offering enhances customer retention and serves to limit customer churn.

**_Diversity across geography and product_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group operates in 38 countries, spanning the Caribbean, Central
America, Europe, Africa, Middle East, Asia as well as the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. In financial terms, the
spread of geographies from which it draws revenue reduces Cable & Wireless Communications exposure to any
single country or region. For the six months ended 30 September 2009, the split of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s EBITDA across the four regional operations was as follows: Panama (34%),
Caribbean (33%), Macau (17%) and Monaco & Islands (16%). The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s
revenue is also spread across a range of products and services, reducing its reliance on any single product line.
For the six months ended 30 September 2009, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group reported revenue
was split across its product set as follows: mobile (39%), broadband (9%), domestic voice (21%), international
voice (8%), enterprise, data and other products (23%).

**_Strong cash generation and cash conversion of profit_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group is a highly cash generative group of businesses and has a good
track record of converting its EBITDA to cash flow with US$1.6 billion of cash repatriation since April 2006. A
strong existing asset base and management discipline on capital expenditure underpins the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s focus on cash generation.

**_Brand strength_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group has a recognised and respected brand in “Cable & Wireless”,
which has been used for more than 70 years. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group will be able to
continue to leverage the “Cable & Wireless” brand’s heritage and recognition following the Demerger. In
Panama, the Seychelles, Bermuda and the South Atlantic islands business units, the “Cable & Wireless” brand is
the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s primary product brand, while in the rest of the business it
remains an important secondary brand, which is known in the market and is used particularly with government,
regulatory and enterprise customers. In the Caribbean, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group uses the

101


-----

“LIME” brand, in Macau the “CTM” brand and in Monaco, the “Monaco Telecom” brand, each of which are
recognised as strong brands in their respective markets, associated with the Cable & Wireless name.

**_Exposure to markets with enhanced GDP growth_**

Certain markets within the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business have in recent years enjoyed
economic growth above the rates of growth being achieved in more developed markets such as the US and Europe.
Panama and Macau, in particular, have enjoyed enhanced GDP growth in the past few years. In 2009, Panama
achieved an estimated GDP growth rate of 1.8%, in contrast to the economic recessions suffered in many other
countries. In 2008, Panama reported official GDP growth of 9.2%. Macau’s economy has also grown rapidly in
recent years, driven by the construction and operation of large-scale casinos. In 2007 and 2008, its GDP figures
grew by 32.0% and 15.5% respectively. In the early part of 2009, Macau suffered an economic downturn, in part
due to visa restrictions on Chinese mainland tourists travelling to Macau, but its economy began to recover in the
middle of 2009 as restrictions were relaxed. In July to September 2009, Macau reported GDP growth of 1.2%.

**_Network reach and fixed line infrastructure strength_**

In many of its markets, including Panama, Macau, Monaco and many of its markets in the Caribbean, the Cable
& Wireless Communications Group operates the largest fixed line telecommunications network, providing the
most comprehensive coverage. In several markets, including Macau, Monaco and the Maldives, the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group is currently the sole fixed line network operator, providing a significant
strategic advantage, and positioning it as the leading provider of fixed voice and broadband services.

**_Ownership of, and access to, regional cable networks_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group owns solely or in partnership, or has substantial IRU capacity on
a number of regional sub-sea cable systems with land capacity in over 60 countries. This allows the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group to carry large amounts of voice and data traffic on behalf of consumers,
enterprises and carriers and provides inbuilt resilience due to the capability of rerouting traffic.

**_Management experience and diversity_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group has a senior executive team which combines international as well as
local experience. Each business has a local management team which reports into one of the four regional operations.
The senior executive team has more than 125 years of experience in the telecommunications industry among them.

**_Positive and constructive government relations_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group has long-standing governmental relationships in most of the
countries where it operates. In several countries where the Cable & Wireless Communications Group provides
services, for example, Panama, Macau, Monaco, Grenada, Dominica and the Maldives, the government part-owns
the relevant business and works with the Cable & Wireless Communications Group as a partner. In several markets,
the Cable & Wireless Communications Group is also one of the largest employers and corporate taxpayers.

**STRATEGY AND GROWTH**

**_Strategy_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s strategy is focused on developing and growing its businesses to
drive strong returns to shareholders. Each regional operation operates as a stand-alone competitive
telecommunications enterprise, and is required to meet annual financial performance targets. Each is profitable
and cash generative in its own right and strives to deliver world class metrics. The Cable & Wireless
Communications Group operation in London brings scale, collaboration, expertise, access to finance and
governance on behalf of shareholders to the entire Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s regional
operations.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s strategic plan focuses on generating growth and value for
shareholders through three elements:

(a) _Delivering operational excellence_

Each business operation seeks to drive service excellence and efficiency to maintain a strong competitive
foundation, enabling the businesses to win new customers as well as retain existing customers. Each
business will strive to achieve leading positions in service and network coverage in its markets increase its
efficiency and streamline its processes.

102


-----

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business operations target operational excellence in
customer services, aiming to provide market leading service against metrics such as response times to repair
faults or responses to customer enquiries. Network coverage is another area in which the strategy of
operational excellence is applied, with new processes and technology being deployed and, where necessary,
new capital expenditure investment to ensure superior coverage for customers on both wireless and fixed
networks.

The strategy of operational excellence requires business units to streamline their current cost bases and
capital expenditure, while striving to achieve improved service and coverage. An example of this is the
mobile tower sharing agreement into which the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s subsidiary in
Jamaica has entered with one of its competitors which has increased network coverage and lowered longterm capital expenditure costs. Other cost reduction activities may include outsourcing and increased
collaboration amongst Cable & Wireless Communications Group companies on procurement activities to
maximise synergies.

(b) _Expanding product offering through new services_

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group is focused on capturing new organic growth opportunities
from services which can be offered to its customer base. These services, in most cases, will leverage the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s strengths, for example, mobile market leadership, fixed line
networks and strength, ownership of and access to regional cable networks. The introduction of new
services aims to drive revenue and offset any decline in existing services as well as repositioning the
business to the changing demands of the markets in which it operates.

New services include:

—Managed services

A service in which the Cable & Wireless Communications Group takes on the management of a
corporate or government customer’s telecommunication services, as well as providing the telecom
service (e.g. voice and data) itself. The Panama operation has won several managed services contracts
with the Panamanian government including running the telecom platform for the country’s “911”
emergency services.

—Cable/Carrier

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group has substantial cable assets in the Caribbean and
Central American regions, which offer new commercial opportunities as the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s focus broadens from using these assets for internal purposes only to
capitalising on the growing wholesale market. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s cable
assets are strategically placed to capture the rapidly increasing demand for resilient and large
bandwidth data transit between Central and South America, and the United States.

—Pay-TV

Pay-TV services enable the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business operations to offer
bundled ‘triple-play’ (pay-TV, fixed line and broadband) or ‘quad-play’ (pay-TV, fixed line, broadband
and mobile) services where permitted by law. Pay-TV operators have emerged in several
telecommunications markets as a competitive threat to telecommunications companies, as many have
the capability to provide fixed line and broadband services. In Panama, the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group launched a pay-TV service in December 2009.

—Mobile data

Mobile data services have emerged through the development of higher capacity mobile networks—in
particular 3G networks—and the development of mobile handsets being capable of receiving the
Internet (data) at, relatively, high speeds. In markets in which it operates high capacity networks, the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group is able to offer its customers mobile broadband propositions
and value-added services, such as commercial services available over the Internet and instant
messaging services.

(c) _Developing core regional hubs_

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s long-term business development strategy is focused around
a small number of core regional hubs from which it will develop a scalable platform of services, capabilities

and management. This focuses on: Latin America, led by the Panama operation; the Caribbean; Macau; and
the clusters of the Monaco & Islands business. In developing these hubs, the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group is seeking to take advantage of its proximity to markets adjacent to each hub, as
well as creating a base for offering cross-border telecommunication services, such as managed services for
multinational customers. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group will also manage its business
around these regional hubs to deliver value to shareholders. This will include considering the acquisition of
licences and the roll out of services into adjacent territories, acquisitions or disposals or increasing its stake
in current investments, for example, the recent additional investment in the Maldives, when it is possible to
enhance value.

**_Growth_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s strategic approach is to capitalise on growth opportunities and
trends in its core mobile, fixed line and broadband product set. In particular, the Directors believe growth
opportunities exist in the following segments:

(i) Broadband—Low levels of broadband penetration in some markets across the business offer growth
potential. Panama, some parts of the Caribbean and several regions in the Monaco & Islands business have
lower levels of broadband penetration than more developed markets. Network improvement and marketing
initiatives such as bundled services provide an opportunity, where permitted, to grow this segment in lowerpenetrated markets. As the market leader in fixed line in many of its markets and the only full service
provider in most, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group is well positioned to offer competitive
broadband services to customers. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group has also started offering
pay-TV services in certain markets, with the intention of both growing revenue and retaining customers
which might otherwise turn to new competitors offering bundled services;

(ii) Enterprise—Revenue earned from enterprise customers has recorded strong growth in the past 18 months
and provides an opportunity for further growth. Governments have been a major customer for managed
services applications, particularly in Panama. The growth of large enterprises in certain markets, such as
large casino groups in Macau, resort and hotel groups in the Seychelles, financial services businesses in the
Caribbean and the Channel Islands and insurance and reinsurance businesses in Bermuda, has provided an
expanding potential customer base for enterprise services. Services include data access and hosting services
for companies that conduct large amounts of business over the Internet or other networks. The Cable &
Wireless Communications Group has good existing data centre capability, particularly in Guernsey and
Panama. The Directors believe the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s position as a trusted local
partner in these territories provides a competitive advantage; and

(iii) Mobile—Opportunities exist for capturing additional value through the introduction of new services, as well
as improving market share.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s strategy is also designed to capture the benefit of favourable
macroeconomic and microeconomic factors in each of the markets it operates in. A predicted return to economic
growth is expected to generate increased demand for telecommunications services and benefit several of the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s markets. In microeconomic terms, the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group also benefits from a range of localised drivers:

(i) Panama: A large government-sponsored capital works programme including a multi-billion US dollar
investment programme to expand the capacity of the Panama Canal is expected to complete in 2014.
Panama is also building an increasing role as a hub for Latin America, and achieving GDP growth—11.5%
in 2007, 9.2% in 2008 and 1.8% in 2009 amidst adverse global economic conditions;

(ii) Macau: Growth arising from the development of gaming, tourism and corporate conferencing sectors.
Macau surpassed Las Vegas in annual gaming revenue from 2006. Macau attracts a large numbers of
visitors, particularly from China and Southeast Asia;

(iii) Caribbean: The Caribbean region has suffered a significant economic downturn in recent times, but remains
one of the most popular leisure tourism regions in the world. The region stands to benefit from an
anticipated recovery of the US and European economies led by increasing tourism, as well as offshore
financial services; and

(iv) Monaco & Islands: While affected by the economic downturn, the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group’s businesses operate in economies which benefit from gaming (Monaco and Channel Islands), luxury
tourism (Seychelles, the Maldives and Monaco), as well as offshore financial services (Channel Islands, Isle
of Man, Monaco and Bermuda).

**NETWORK TECHNOLOGY**

Differing market conditions and histories mean that the precise technical details of network deployment vary
across the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s regional operations. However, the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s larger full service (fixed/mobile/broadband) operations exhibit common themes in
existing and planned network technologies:

- Second generation (2G) digital mobile networks based on international standard GSM technology, providing
voice and “2.5G” GPRS/EDGE data services. 2G geographic coverage is extensive in all the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group’s operations that operate mobile networks. The largest networks are in the
Caribbean, Panama and Macau with 950, 571 and 263 radio base stations respectively. The Caribbean and
Panama networks operate in the American standard 850 and 1900 MHz spectrum bands. Other networks
operate in the European/Asian standard 900 and 1800 MHz spectrum bands.

- Third generation (3G) digital mobile networks based on internationally standard UMTS technology provide
enhanced voice and data services. In addition to basic 3G services, “3.5G” High Speed Packet Access
technology provides high speed mobile broadband services. The extent of 3G mobile network deployment
depends on the maturity of the market. 3G coverage is extensive in Macau, Monaco and the Channel Islands.
In Panama, Jamaica and the Maldives, 3G coverage is currently provided in the major population centres and
is in the process of being deployed more widely. In Panama and the Caribbean, 3G is deployed in the
American standard 850 MHz spectrum band to provide enhanced in-building coverage. 3G is deployed in the
European/Asian standard 2100 MHz spectrum band in other operations.

- The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s history in fixed line services is voice telephony based on
copper access lines. The largest networks are in the Caribbean, Panama and Macau with 725,000, 422,000
and 182,000 lines in service respectively. Electronic voice switches are still predominantly based on Time
Division Multiplexing technology. Some obsolete switches have been replaced by VoIP technology, and this
replacement is progressing on an “as needed” basis.

- In recent years, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group has invested heavily in providing high speed
fixed broadband services using Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) technology over copper. The extent of fixed
broadband rollout depends on the maturity of the market. Monaco, Macau and Barbados have the highest levels
of deployment with 67%, 70% and 36% respectively of fixed customers subscribing to broadband with speeds
in the 4Mbps to 15Mbps range. Fixed broadband is also deployed in the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group’s other fixed line businesses with broadband speeds generally in the 1Mbps to 4Mbps range.

- The Cable & Wireless Communications Group operates Hybrid Fibre Coax (HFC) cable TV networks in
Monaco (16,000 customers) and St. Lucia (23,000 customers), and is in the process of rolling out HFC digital
cable TV in Panama (at launch approximately 80,000 customers).

- The Cable & Wireless Communications Group provides fibre-to-the-premise fixed access lines for its larger
business customers, enabling very high speed converged voice/data/video services. Some limited deployment
of fibre-to-the-premise has also taken place for selected high value residential customers.

- By operating both fixed and mobile services in most of its markets, the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group has been able to optimise its in-country backhaul and transmission networks. Core networks are
mostly based on Internet Protocol (IP) fibre transmission operating at multiple Gbps speeds, with Multi
Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) based switching and routing to efficiently handle converged voice/data/
video services with high resilience and predictable quality of service. The Cable & Wireless Communications
Group’s largest networks are in Panama with 200 primary access network nodes and 2,750 kilometres of fibre
cable, Jamaica with 120 primary access network nodes and 2,750 kilometres of fibre cable and Macau with
10 primary access network nodes and 640 kilometres of fibre cable.

- Terrestrial cable distribution corresponds to the electrical power utility practices in each country. For
example, in the Caribbean and Panama, this is mostly overhead cabling on poles, while in Europe, this is
mostly underground ducted and buried.

- The Cable & Wireless Communications Group either owns outright or through a consortium, or has longterm-leases for, international cable capacity to serve its largest businesses. The extensive undersea cable
systems diversely connect the Caribbean, Panama and Bermuda to the US and have approximately 60 Gbps
of total capacity. Macau has 24 Gbps of diverse cable capacity to connect to Hong Kong and mainland China.
The Maldives has 10 Gbps of undersea capacity connecting to Sri Lanka. The Cable & Wireless
Communications Group currently uses satellite systems only on a limited basis, principally in the Seychelles
and the South Atlantic islands, and to provide connectivity to Africa.

-----

(i) **_Panama_**

Cable & Wireless Panama (CWP) is the market leader in mobile, broadband and fixed line services in the
expanding Panamanian economy. As at 30 September 2009, CWP had 1.8 million active mobile customers
and 127,000 broadband customers in a total population of approximately 3.4 million. In fixed line, CWP is
the largest operator in the country with 418,000 customers, a position of significant strategic advantage.
CWP has also recently entered the pay-TV market, through the development of a pay-TV platform. CWP
also offers several managed services (such as emergency telecommunications services) to the Panamanian
government. Panama is also a regional hub for telecommunications traffic between North and South
America.

CWP became a subsidiary of the Cable & Wireless Group upon its acquisition in 1997. Cable and Wireless
plc holds 49% of CWP’s shares, in partnership with the government of Panama, which also owns 49%, and
a local employee trust, which controls the balancing 2%. Despite holding only 49%, Cable & Wireless has
management control of the Panama business through the appointment of 5 of the 9 members of the board,
including the Chief Executive Officer and the Executive President.

CWP operates in a competitive market in Panama, particularly in mobile. The largest mobile competitor is
Movistar (a subsidiary of Telefonica) which is the second largest operator behind CWP. The other mobile
competitors are Digicel and America Movil, both of which entered the market in the last year or so. CWP
has been successful at broadly maintaining its market share and brand leadership following the entry of
these two new competitors. In fixed line, broadband and pay-TV, CWP’s major competitor is Cable Onda, a
pay-TV business which has broadened its business into fixed and broadband services.

CWP is led by its CEO, Jorge Nicolau, and an experienced management team. Mr Nicolau was appointed as
Chief Executive Officer of CWP in January 2007 and is the first Panamanian CEO of Cable & Wireless
Panama since the acquisition by Cable and Wireless plc.

CWP’s strategy is focused on: defending its market leading positions; growing its pay-TV operation and
targeting market leadership in the long-term; developing its bundled offers; building its proposition in
mobile data and enterprise and employing cost reduction programmes to maintain its margins.

(ii) Macau

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business in Macau, CTM, is the exclusive provider of
domestic and international fixed line services. It is the sole provider of broadband services and the leading
mobile operator in the Macau Special Administrative Region (SAR). At 30 September 2009, CTM had
395,000 active mobile customers in one of the world’s most competitive mobile markets as well as 182,000
fixed line and 127,000 broadband customers. The Macau economy and CTM are well-positioned to benefit
from the anticipated economic growth in China and the South East Asian region. Macau is one of the
premier destinations for Chinese tourists and it received 22 million visitors in 2009 (Source: Macau DSEC:
Statistics and Census Service) and is one of the world’s largest gaming markets by revenue.

CTM was established in 1981 and has four shareholders. Cable and Wireless plc holds 51%, and has
management control, with the remaining 49% held by Portugal Telecom (28%), CITIC Pacific (20%), and
the Macau SAR government (1%). CTM retains exclusivity over the region’s fixed line services under an
operating arrangement in place with the Macau SAR government. On 6 November 2009, CTM signed a
revision of the operating agreement with the government of Macau. The revised agreement extended CTM’s
operating arrangement until 2016, with an additional automatic extension until 2021, securing the long-term
future of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business there notwithstanding expected
competition in fixed line data services from 2010 and the anticipated liberalisation of fixed line voice
services in 2012. Going forward, CTM’s strategy will be to maintain its market leading positions, further
develop its services including mobile data and enterprise and consider the introduction of other new
services, such as pay-TV.

In June 2007, CTM was the first operator in Macau to introduce 3G technology, enabling it to expand the
range of mobile services it offers to customers. CTM now offers mobile voice, data and Internet services to
business and residential customers. In broadband, CTM offers high download speed services to residential
and business customers. It also offers enterprise solutions, including leased lines.

CTM operates in a competitive market in mobile, competing with Hutchison, China Telecom and
SmarTone. Each operator in this market holds a licence to offer 3G services. CTM currently remains the
exclusive operator in fixed line voice services and is currently the sole provider of fixed line broadband
services, with competition expected to enter the market in 2010.

107

CTM is led by Vandy Poon, who in September 2007 became the first local Chinese to be appointed as the
Chief Executive Officer of a large utility corporation in Macau. Prior to this appointment, Mr. Poon had
served as Deputy CEO.

(iii) Caribbean

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group is the largest telecommunications provider by revenue across
the Caribbean markets in which it operates, with subsidiary operations in 13 national markets, in addition to
a joint venture in Trinidad and Tobago. Historically operated as a group of separate businesses, the
subsidiary businesses were integrated in 2008 into one regional operating entity as part of the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group’s ongoing “One Caribbean” transformation programme and rebranded
under the name LIME. The Caribbean business is the largest of the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group’s four regional operations by revenue.

As at 30 September 2009, LIME had 1,279,000 mobile customers, 645,000 fixed line customers and
204,000 broadband customers. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s joint venture in Trinidad
and Tobago had 892,000 mobile customers, 294,000 fixed line customers and 71,000 broadband customers
as at 30 September 2009. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group is the market leader in fixed line in
all of the markets in which it operates apart from Antigua. In mobile, it is the market leader in nine of the
markets in which it has subsidiaries and in Trinidad and Tobago, and is the second-placed operator in the
other four (Jamaica, St Lucia, St Vincent and Grenada). The Cable & Wireless Communications Group is
the market leader in broadband in each of its markets in the Caribbean apart from Cayman and Turks and
Caicos. It has the competitive advantage of offering the widest range of mobile, broadband and fixed line
services across the region with the ability to offer customers the convenience of a single bill and bundled
proposition across many of the national markets.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group wholly owns eight of the businesses it operates in the
Caribbean, and owns a further five businesses in partnership with either the local government (for example,
in Dominica) or the public, via listing on the local stock exchange (for example, in Jamaica, Barbados and
St Kitts and Nevis), or a combination of both (for example, in Grenada). In Trinidad and Tobago, it holds a
non-controlling stake (49%) in the largest local operator, Telecommunications Services of Trinidad and
Tobago Limited (TSTT) in partnership with the government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago (51%).

Most of the Caribbean businesses are operating in a fully competitive environment. Following liberalisation
over the past 10 years, the liberalisation process in each market is now complete (apart from Montserrat,
where the liberalisation process commenced in 2009 and Antigua, where the government retains a monopoly
over domestic fixed line services and LIME retains exclusivity on international voice services) and, while
each business has made progress, considerable scope remains for further efficiencies and growth. In
Jamaica, where LIME has faced tough competition in mobile, a turnaround is in progress as part of the One
Caribbean programme. The transformation programme is ongoing through a range of initiatives: the further
development of the LIME brand and culture; continuing cost reduction initiatives and ongoing service
improvements; and improving network infrastructure. The business aims to have a leaner and more efficient
structure to capture the benefit of the expected economic upturn. Its future growth will be supported by the
expansion of its mobile network and its drive into new service segments, including pay-TV, enterprise and
managed services and carrier services.

In the Caribbean, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group competes with a range of different
competitors across its 13 national markets. In mobile, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s main
competitor is Digicel, which operates in 13 markets in common with the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group. Other mobile competitors include America Movil (Jamaica) and CCT Global Communications
(BVI). In fixed line and broadband, there are a range of local island competitors to LIME, including Digicel
(Jamaica and Cayman), America Movil (Jamaica), Flow (Jamaica and Grenada), TeleBarbados (Barbados),
WestTel (Cayman), TeleCayman (Cayman), CCT Global Communications (BVI) and Caribbean Cable
Communications (Anguilla and Nevis) and Karib Cable (St. Lucia and St. Vincent).

The Caribbean regional operation is led by David Shaw, CEO. Mr Shaw was appointed in July 2009, and in
addition to running the 13 LIME businesses, is responsible for leading the second phase of the “One
Caribbean” transformation programme, focusing on improving customer service and culture.

(iv) Monaco & Islands

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s Monaco & Islands operation incorporates Monaco and a
host of island nations including Bermuda, Guernsey, Jersey, Isle of Man, Seychelles, the Maldives and
several UK overseas territories such as the Falkland Islands and St Helena. It has a presence in 22 markets

108


-----

in total. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group has 159,000 mobile customers, 217,000 fixed line
customers and 34,000 broadband customers in Monaco & Islands subsidiaries as at 30 September 2009. Its
joint venture businesses have 3.7 million mobile customers, 47,000 fixed line customers and 14,000
broadband customers as at 30 September 2009. Across the business, strategic focus is to: grow the mobile
and broadband business; improve service quality through initiatives such as boosting mobile indoor
coverage; develop managed services particularly for the financial services, gaming and hotels industries and
deliver operational efficiency.

The largest business within the Monaco & Islands operation is the Dhiraagu business in the Maldives. From
October 2009, Dhiraagu has been accounted for as a subsidiary of Monaco & Islands, rather than as a joint
venture. Dhiraagu is the market leader in mobile, broadband and fixed line services. Dhiraagu competes
with Wataniya in the mobile market, and is the exclusive provider of fixed line and broadband services.
Dhiraagu, which is 52% owned by the Cable & Wireless Communications Group, is run in partnership with
the Government of the Maldives, holding a 48% interest. The Maldives government has declared its
intention to sell down part of its stake via an initial public offering in the 2010/11 financial year. Dhiraagu’s
focus is to maintain market leadership and customer service excellence.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group holds 49% of the total share capital of Monaco Telecom and
has voting and economic rights in respect of an additional 6% through a contractual arrangement. The
Principality of Monaco holds the remaining 45%. Monaco Telecom, which is the market leader in Monaco,
is the exclusive provider of broadband, fixed line and television services. Broadband penetration is 86% as
at 30 September 2009 and while mobile penetration is high, the Directors believe that value added services
offer growth potential in this market, which has a proportionately high number of high net worth individuals
and successful businesses. Monaco Telecom competes in mobile with French operators SFR and Bouygues
in the Principality, but is the exclusive provider of fixed line services and fixed line broadband services.

Monaco Telecom has also developed an international business, which has invested in several
communications businesses in developing nations and pursuant to contractual arrangements, provides
managed telecommunications services to PTK, a telecommunications operator in Kosovo. Among these
investments is Monaco Telecom’s 36.75% stake in Roshan, a mobile phone operator in Afghanistan, and its
65% stake in Connecteo, a high-speed broadband service in West Africa (covering Benin, Burkina Faso,
Cameroon, Guinea, Niger and Senegal). Monaco Telecom also owns 99.9% of Divona Algerie, a
telecommunications operator providing broadband services in Algeria. Monaco Telecom also has a contract
with OnAir, an operator which provides phone services on aircraft.

In the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, where the Cable & Wireless Communications Group operates
through wholly owned subsidiaries, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group provides services under
the “Sure” brand and has capitalised on enterprise customer opportunities, particularly with financial and
gaming companies. In mobile, Sure competes with Wave Telecom and Airtel in Guernsey, Jersey Telecom
and Airtel in Jersey and Telefonica (Manx Telecom) in the Isle of Man. In Guernsey, Wave and Airtel also
offer fixed and broadband services. Cable & Wireless Communications Group aims to defend its market
position in Guernsey and grow market share in Jersey and the Isle of Man.

In Bermuda, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group, through Cable & Wireless Bermuda, has been
providing international telecommunications to the island since 1890. Bermuda is a premier tourist
destination, and has a thriving insurance and reinsurance industry. As well as providing IDD telephone
services to over 200 countries, Cable & Wireless Bermuda’s digital fibre optic communication systems
facilitate a wide range of services such as data centre and disaster recovery services. Cable & Wireless
Bermuda competes with three other international service providers: Keytech, TBI and Brasil Telecom.

In the Seychelles, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group is the market leader in fixed line, mobile
and broadband services. The Seychelles constitute an archipelago of 41 islands, 33 of which are inhabited.
This geographic spread means that broadband penetration is low, and services are generally provided via
satellite as opposed to cable, but the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s investment in the network
is expected to drive growth. Cable & Wireless Seychelles is wholly-owned by Cable and Wireless plc, and
has a 110 year history with Cable and Wireless plc. In the Seychelles, Cable & Wireless Seychelles
competes with Airtel in mobile, fixed line and broadband services; with Intelvision in fixed voice and
broadband services and with Kokonet for broadband services.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group, through wholly-owned subsidiaries of Cable and Wireless
plc, is also the sole telecommunications provider in a group of UK overseas territories including the
Falkland Islands, St Helena and Diego Garcia and provides a full service offering in Ascension Island.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group also has joint ventures in the Solomon Islands (Solomon
Telekom), Fiji (Fintel) and Telecom Vanuatu (in Vanuatu).

The Monaco & Islands operation is led by Denis Martin, CEO, who was appointed in April 2009.
Mr. Martin was promoted to this position from his former appointment as CEO of Monaco Telecom, and
has previous industry experience with the French SFR-Cegetel group.

**REGULATORY OVERVIEW**

Each of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s businesses is subject to telecommunications regulation,
as well as other applicable laws, in the markets in which they operate. The regulatory regime varies from market
to market, and is influenced by factors such as population, economic development, geographical landscape,
available technologies, customer penetration, political factors, government social and economic policy and the
number of existing competitors.

In some markets at a more advanced stage of liberalisation, regulators are gradually introducing regulation to
encourage further competition. Depending on the characteristics of the particular market, this regulation may
include obligations such as number portability both in fixed line and mobile services, mandated access to mobile
networks and other forms of service reselling such as Indirect Access and Local Loop Unbundling (LLU). For
instance, number portability currently is in operation in Macau, Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man in respect
of mobile services. Number portability has been in operation in Panama in fixed line (in onward forwarding
method) since 2003, with only 1% of fixed lines being ported to date, and will be mandatory from August 2010
for mobile and fixed line (in all call query methodology). Number portability has been mandated for
implementation on both fixed line and mobile services in the Cayman Islands. The regulator is in consultation on
fixed and mobile number portability in Bermuda. Number portability policies are changing in many of the
markets in which Cable & Wireless Communications Group operates and number portability may become
mandatory in additional Cable & Wireless Communications Group markets. Indirect Access and regulated resale/
wholesale regulation is in force in certain parts of the Caribbean. Access-based regulation is likely to develop
slowly and will be shaped heavily by local factors at play in each market. LLU regulation was implemented in
Panama in 2006. However, to date, no requests have been received to unbundle any lines.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group operates largely in competitive markets. However, in a small
number of markets, including Monaco, Macau, Montserrat, Antigua and the Solomon Islands, the relevant Cable
& Wireless Communications Group company was granted exclusivity in respect of some services. In these
markets, there is a risk that such exclusivity will be terminated prior to the end of the term granted by the
regulator. In Montserrat and Solomon Islands, for example, the regulators have terminated exclusivity in 2009,
ahead of the scheduled expiration date of the monopoly granted to the Cable & Wireless Communications Group.
In Macau, competition in the remaining exclusive operations, fixed line data and fixed line voice markets, is
expected in 2010 and 2012 respectively. The businesses are readying themselves for the onset of competition in
the market by ensuring that they continue to provide the best products and services available in the territory.
Additionally, the businesses have engaged proactively with the local government and regulators with a view to
achieving fair compensation and tariff rebalancing, as appropriate.

Each of the businesses works with local regulators with a view to ensuring fair and efficient regulation that is
appropriate to the particular characteristics of the relevant market. Regulatory compliance is carefully managed
by each business, supported by its local legal and regulatory team. For a description of the risk of regulatory
changes, see “Risk Factors—Risks relating to the Telecommunications Industry and Market in which the Cable &
_Wireless Communications Group Operates”._

**PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT**

In each of its businesses Cable & Wireless Communications owns or controls, through long term leases, licences
or easements, the property, plant and equipment necessary to provide telecommunications services to residential
consumers, small and medium-sized enterprises, corporate customers and governments. Cable & Wireless
Communications’ telecommunications services vary from region to region but typically include mobile,
broadband and domestic and international fixed line services, as well as cable TV and other pay-TV services in
some locations.

Cable & Wireless Communications’ property portfolio includes land, office space, retail shop space and space on
or within various existing structures used to house plant and equipment which provides connectivity and
transmission. The plant and equipment comprises of data switching, routing, transmission and receiving
equipment; computer systems, connecting lines (cables, wires, fibres, poles, antennas, towers and other support
structures, ducting and similar items); international submarine cables and Indefeasible Rights of Use and other
miscellaneous property including retail equipment, furniture and other office equipment, and plants under
construction.

**MATERIAL LITIGATION**

Save as set out in the paragraph below, there are no governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings (including any
such proceedings which are pending or threatened of which Cable & Wireless Communications is aware), during
a period covering at least the previous 12 months preceding the date of this document which may have, or have
had in the recent past significant effects on Cable & Wireless Communications, the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group and/or the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s financial position or profitability.

In July 2007, Cable and Wireless plc and four Cable & Wireless Communications Group subsidiaries along with
Telecommunications Services of Trinidad and Tobago Limited (TSTT), in which Cable and Wireless plc holds a
49% interest, were served with proceedings in the English High Court by a Caribbean competitor, Digicel. The
claim alleged that the relevant Cable & Wireless Communications Group subsidiaries delayed Digicel’s entry
into six Caribbean markets (St. Lucia, St. Vincent & the Grenadines, Grenada, Barbados, the Cayman Islands and
Turks & Caicos) in breach of applicable statutory and contractual obligations concerning interconnection
services. A similar allegation was made against TSTT. In addition, it was alleged that Cable and Wireless plc and
its four subsidiaries (but not TSTT) conspired to cause delay to Digicel.

The Directors of Cable & Wireless Communications believe the claim is without foundation and it has been
vigorously defended in the English High Court. Although, based on legal advice, the Directors of Cable &
Wireless Communications expect to defend this claim successfully, the Directors of Cable & Wireless
Communications cannot predict the outcome of this legal proceeding. An adverse ruling could lead to the
payment of damages. At this time, it is not possible to estimate potential exposure in the event of an adverse
ruling, as the English High Court is considering only liability and not damage claims. However, as the Directors
of Cable & Wireless Communications expect to successfully defend this claim, they do not expect material
damages to be awarded.

Trial in the English High Court began in May 2009 and closed in November 2009. Cable & Wireless
Communications and Cable and Wireless plc are currently awaiting judgment.

**MATERIAL CONTRACTS**

Save as set out below and in “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements”, there are no contracts, except
those entered into in the ordinary course of business, that are or may be material and:

    - have been entered into by members of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group within the two
years immediately preceding the date of this document; or

    - have been entered into by members of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group and contain any
provision under which any such member has any obligation or entitlement that is material to the Cable
& Wireless Communications Group as at the date of this document.

**Joint Venture and Shareholders’ Agreements**

**_Monaco shareholders’ agreement_**

On 18 June 2004, Cable and Wireless plc, La Société Nationale de Financement (SNF), La Compagnie
Monégasque de Communication (CMC) and La Compagnie Monégasque de Banque (CMB) entered into a

111


-----

shareholders’ agreement to establish Monaco Telecom S.A.M. (MT). MT provides public telecommunications
services in the territory of the Principality of Monaco (Monaco). Cable and Wireless plc directly holds a 49%
stake in the share capital of MT, with voting and economic rights in respect of an additional 6% through
contractual arrangement.

The agreement’s change of control clause provides that upon a Cable and Wireless plc change of control, CMC
will assign MT’s securities to SNF at a price determined by mutual agreement of the parties, or, if no agreement
is reached, at market value, subject to the condition that the State of Monaco or CMC, as appropriate, has given
its prior consent to such change of control. The agreement contains a similar provision in respect of a change of
control of SNF. Pursuant to a letter of amendment dated 18 October 2008, the parties to the agreement consented
to any change of control of Cable and Wireless plc under the Demerger Proposals and therefore no transfer of
MT’s securities is required.

Cable and Wireless plc has also given a joint and several guarantee in favour of SNF, guaranteeing the payment
of certain sums that may be payable by CMC to SNF under the agreement, including all default interest, charges
and ancillary expenses. The agreement prohibits Cable and Wireless plc from competing with MT within
Monaco. The agreement gives SNF the right, under certain specified circumstances, to exercise a put option in
respect of its MT securities.

**_The Maldives shareholders’ agreement_**

On 17 May 1988, Cable and Wireless plc and the government of the Republic of Maldives (the Maldives
**Government) entered into a shareholders’ agreement, pursuant to which a joint company called Dhivehi**
Raajjeyge Gulhun Private Limited (Dhiraagu) was established to own, operate, manage and maintain the
national and international Maldives telecommunications systems and services of the Republic of Maldives (the
**Maldives). Cable and Wireless plc’s interest was subsequently transferred to Cable & Wireless Middle East &**
Islands Limited (CWMEIL). The shareholders’ agreement was amended and restated on 18 October 2009,
pursuant to which the parties agreed to the terms and conditions upon which Dhiraagu would be regulated and
managed.

CWMEIL owns a controlling stake of 52% in Dhiraagu and the Maldives Government owns the remaining 48%
On 24 December 2008, the Communication Authority of the Maldives granted Dhiraagu a non-exclusive licence
to operate telecommunications services in the Maldives for a period of 15 years, commencing 1 January 2009.
Under the terms of the amended and restated shareholders’ agreement, any transfer of shares by a shareholder in
Dhiraagu is subject to pre-emption rights, whereby the non-selling shareholder has the right to buy the relevant
shares from the selling shareholder at a price to be mutually agreed or, otherwise, determined by an independent
accountant. If the controlling shareholder, in this case CWMEIL, proposes to transfer its shares, the non-selling
shareholder has tag-along rights to sell its shares on the same terms as those of the controlling shareholder.
CWMEIL may however transfer its shares within the Cable & Wireless Group without restriction. Any
amalgamation or reconstruction directly involving Dhiraagu will require a special resolution.

**_Trinidad and Tobago agreement_**

The Trinidad and Tobago Telephone Company Limited (now TSTT) is 49% owned by Cable & Wireless (West
Indies) Limited (CWWI) and 51% owned by National Enterprises Limited. Under the terms of an agreement the
government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago (the TT Government) authorised TSTT, by way of licence,
to maintain and operate an external telecommunications network for Trinidad and Tobago until July 2009, with
an option for renewal which was exercised. CWWI may sell, charge or create a lien over its 49% shareholding
after full payment, provided it maintains a minimum interest of 29% in the issued share capital of TSTT at any
one time. This is conditional upon approval by the TT Government, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld. Under an operating agreement dated 31 December 2005, the TT Government and the
Telecommunications Authority of Trinidad and Tobago authorised TSTT, by way of a renewable licence, to
operate a public telecommunications network and provide telecommunications and broadcasting services in
Trinidad and Tobago, which may be subject to certain anti-competitive provisions, for a period of ten years with
effect from 30 December 2005. On 30 December 2005, the TT Government granted TSTT a renewable spectrum
licence (the Spectrum Licence) to operate and use radio communications services and radio transmitting
equipment in Trinidad and Tobago. The Spectrum Licence was granted to TSTT to operate on different
bandwidths and the licence periods range from two and a half to ten years with effect from 30 December 2005.
The Spectrum Licence is transferable subject to the prior written approval of the Telecommunications Authority
of Trinidad and Tobago which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

-----

**_Macau agreement_**

On 20 August 1981, Cable and Wireless plc and the Government of Macau (the Macau Government), entered
into an agreement (the Original Agreement), under which Cable and Wireless plc agreed to form a company—
Companhia De Telecomuniçacões de Macau S.A.R.L. (CTM) to operate, on an exclusive basis, public
telecommunications services in Macau. The Original Agreement was successively amended on 6 December 1999
and by a revised agreement dated 6 November 2009 (the Revised Agreement).

Cable and Wireless plc holds 51%, Portugal Telecom holds 28%, CITIC Pacific holds 20% and the Macau
Government holds 1%, of the issued share capital of CTM. Under article seven of the statutes of CTM, any
transfer of shares between shareholders or disposal of shares to persons unconnected with CTM requires the prior
written consent of the Governor of Macau, the Macau Government and the founding members. Such transfer and/
or disposal are subject to the pre-emption rights of the non-selling shareholders. Where more than one
shareholder indicates that he wishes to exercise his right, preference will be given to the shareholder with the
largest shareholding and, where that shareholding is the same, preference will be given to the shareholder of
longest standing.

In addition to the Revised Agreement, CTM operates pursuant to the terms of Mobile Services Licence for 2G
and 3G mobile services (the Mobile Licences) and an Internet Services Licence (the Internet Licence). CTM
was appointed as the exclusive operator of public telecommunications in Macau on 20 August 1981 pursuant to
the Original Agreement and was re-appointed as exclusive operator in fixed line on 6 December 1999 and
6 November 2009 under the Revised Agreement. CTM has also been appointed as a licencee under a 2G Mobile
Licence for a period of eight years from 2002, extended for a further two years from 2010, as a licencee under a
3G Mobile Licence for a period of eight years from 2007, and as a licencee under the Internet Licence for a
period of five years from 2003, renewed for another five years from 2008. CTM must pay to the Macau
Government a royalty of 5% of the fixed and mobile network revenue per annum but not in respect of Internet
revenue, for which no royalty is payable. The Revised Agreement is transferable either through payment or free
of charge with the prior approval of the Macau Government and contains various provisions binding CTM to
maintain and develop the telecommunications systems of Macau. The Internet Licence is transferable, either
through payment, or free of charge with the permission of the Secretary for Transport and Public Works. The
Mobile Licence is also transferable, either through payment, or free of charge with the permission of the
Secretary for Transport and Public Works.

**_Panama agreement_**

On 20 May 1997, the Republic of Panama, acting as seller, and Cable and Wireless plc, acting as purchaser (the
**Purchaser) entered into a sale and purchase agreement (the SPA) for the transfer of 245 million Class B Shares**
(the Panama Shares) representing 49% of the share capital of the Panama Company Instituto Nacional de
Telecomunicaciones, S.A. (INTEL).

INTEL was renamed CWP after the share purchase. Cable and Wireless plc, although its wholly owned
subsidiary, Cable and Wireless (Panama Holdings) Limited owns 49% of the issued share capital of CWP, the
Republic of Panama owns 49% of the issued share capital of CWP and a local trust (where beneficiaries are the
employees of CWP) owns 2% of the issued share capital of CWP. Under the SPA, the Republic of Panama has a
right of first refusal in relation to the Panama Shares in accordance with Section 2, paragraph 4 of Act No. 5
(Section 2) for as so long as such Section 2 is in force. While Section 2 remains in force, the Purchaser’s stake in
CWP must not exceed 49%. In the event that Section 2 is modified so as to allow the Purchaser to increase its
stake in CWP, the Republic of Panama will grant to the Purchaser a right of first refusal to purchase such
percentage of Class A Shares as is necessary to effect a 5% increase in the Purchaser’s stake in the CWP. The
Purchaser is not allowed to transfer any of its rights or obligations under the SPA without the prior written
consent of the Republic of Panama.

**Demerger Transaction Agreements**

**_Demerger Agreement_**

Cable & Wireless Communications has entered into a Demerger Agreement with Cable & Wireless Worldwide
and Cable and Wireless plc. The Demerger Agreement sets forth the agreements between Cable & Wireless
Communications, Cable & Wireless Worldwide and Cable and Wireless plc regarding the principal transactions
necessary to effect the Demerger, including the conditions to implementation of the Scheme and the Demerger.
The Demerger Agreement also contains customary warranties from Cable & Wireless Worldwide, Cable &

which the Cable & Wireless Communications Group may incur but which relate exclusively to the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group and vice versa and in respect of an agreed proportion of liabilities which do not relate
exclusively to one group or the other. In consideration for a reciprocal undertaking given by Cable & Wireless
Worldwide, Cable & Wireless Communications also agrees to use its reasonable endeavours to procure that each
member of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group is released from all guarantees and indemnities given in
respect of any liability or obligation of any member of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group and,
pending the release of such guarantees and indemnities, indemnifies the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group
against all liabilities associated therewith. In addition, Cable & Wireless Communications (in respect of
guarantees given by the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group) and Cable & Wireless Worldwide (in respect of
guarantees given by the Cable & Wireless Communications Group) shall pay a negotiated fee for the
maintenance of such guarantees until such time as they are released. The Separation Agreement also includes
provisions relating to the allocation of tax liabilities and the conduct of tax affairs of the Cable & Wireless

-----

agreed the terms of the new contingent funding agreement for the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund
providing security of up to £100 million by way of escrow account or letter of credit in certain circumstances
based on agreed financial and business triggers.

Before Demerger, Cable and Wireless plc, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group and the trustee of the Cable
& Wireless Superannuation Fund and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Retirement Plan will enter into a
pensions agreement which sets out the full terms of the bulk transfer to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Retirement Plan and other agreed details regarding the future funding and investment strategy of the Cable &
Wireless Superannuation Fund.

**_Intellectual Property Arrangements_**

Prior to the Demerger Effective Time, all rights held by the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group and the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group in the Cable & Wireless Trademarks will be assigned to a UK joint venture
company. Shares in the joint venture company will be held 50% by Cable and Wireless plc and 50% by Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Holdings. Cable and Wireless plc will be granted a licence by the joint venture company in
respect of use of the Cable & Wireless Trademarks in the Cable & Wireless Communications Territory (and also
certain rights worldwide) (the Cable & Wireless Communications Licence) and will be granted a licence by the
joint venture company in respect of use of the Cable & Wireless Trademarks in the Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Territory (and also certain rights worldwide) (the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Licence). The Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Brand will be assigned by Cable and Wireless plc to Cable & Wireless Communications at
the Demerger Effective Time and in effecting the Demerger, Cable & Wireless Communications will transfer the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Brand to Cable & Wireless Worldwide.

Under the Cable & Wireless Communications Licence, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group is granted
a licence to use and exploit (including by way of sublicensing) the Cable & Wireless Trademarks in the Cable &
Wireless Communications Territory, and the “Cable & Wireless Globe” logo and the acronym “CWC” globally.
The Cable & Wireless Communications Group is also authorised to use and exploit the Cable & Wireless
Trademarks outside of the Cable & Wireless Communications Territory for certain incidental uses (e.g. use on
the Internet which is targeted to customers in the Cable & Wireless Communications Territory or in order to
identify Cable & Wireless Communications Group companies incorporated outside the Cable & Wireless
Communications Territory), certain grandfathered use on existing materials and for restricted use directly related
to its corporate headquarters and public listing in London and for the purposes of marketing to investors and
financiers. Additionally, in relation to its Carrier Business, Cable & Wireless Communications Group is licensed
to use the Cable & Wireless Trademarks outside the Cable & Wireless Communications Territory in conjunction
with a suffix indicating its country of origin to assist in the identification of the Carrier Business in the global
marketplace. The Cable & Wireless Communications Licence is (save for certain similar global rights in relation
to its Carrier Business and certain similar incidental and grandfathered rights granted to the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group) exclusive in the Cable & Wireless Communications Territory. Under the terms of the Cable
& Wireless Communications Licence, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group is largely unrestricted in its
use of the Cable & Wireless Trademarks within the Cable & Wireless Communications Territory and in relation
to its Carrier Business globally and in its use of the “Globe logo” and the acronym “CWC” globally. The Cable
& Wireless Communications Group’s use of the Cable & Wireless Trademarks outside the Cable & Wireless
Communications Territory other than the “Globe logo” and the acronym “CWC” or in areas other than its Carrier
Businesses is severely restricted to subsidiary use in conjunction with other trademarks or for incidental use or
certain grandfathered use.

Under the terms of the Cable & Wireless Communications Licence, the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group is responsible, within the Cable & Wireless Communications Territory and, in relation to the “Cable &
Wireless Globe” logo and the acronym “CWC” only, also outside the Cable & Wireless Communications
Territory, for prosecuting applications for registration and maintaining existing trademark registrations of the
Cable & Wireless Trademarks at its own cost. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group can also call upon
the joint venture company to file (at the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s cost) new applications for
registration of the Cable &Wireless Trademarks in jurisdictions within the Cable & Wireless Communications
Territory and the “Cable & Wireless Globe” logo and the acronym “CWC” globally, whereupon the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group also assumes responsibility for prosecuting such applications and (once
registered) maintaining such registrations at its own cost.

Under the terms of the Cable & Wireless Communications Licence, the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group has the first right (at its own cost) to take action against third-party infringers of the Cable & Wireless

115


-----

Trademarks within the Cable & Wireless Communications Territory and, in relation to the “Cable & Wireless
Globe” logo and the acronym “CWC” only, also outside the Cable & Wireless Communications Territory and the
joint venture company is obliged to provide, at the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s cost, reasonable
assistance to the Cable & Wireless Communications Group in this regard. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group has similar rights outside the Cable & Wireless Communications Territory, except that the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group does not have any such rights to the “Cable & Wireless Globe” logo.

Under the terms of the Cable & Wireless Communications Licence, the licensor may only terminate the license
or any sub-license under limited circumstances: (i) where either a member of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group or one of its sub-licensees directly or indirectly challenges the validity of any of the
Cable & Wireless Trademarks; and (ii) in relation to a country within the Cable & Wireless Communications
Territory or the Cable & Wireless Communications Licence as a whole, if the Cable & Wireless
Communications licensee is in material breach of the Cable & Wireless Communications Licence and either that
breach is in capable of remedy or it has failed to remedy that breach within 90 days of receiving notice and
following implementation of an escalation procedure under the Cable & Wireless Communications Licence. The
Cable & Wireless Communications licensee may also terminate the agreement on 120 days written notice or
similarly for a breach by the licensor. Acts or omissions of (and therefore breaches by) sub-licensees are deemed
to be acts or omissions of the Cable & Wireless Communications licensee. Aside from these specific termination
provisions, the Cable & Wireless Communications Licence is perpetual and irrevocable.

**MANAGEMENT**

**DIRECTORS OF CABLE & WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS**

**Sir Richard Lapthorne, CBE—Chairman**

Cable and Wireless plc has complied with all of the provisions set out in Section One of the Combined Code
throughout the period of its last financial year and up until 28 January 2010 (being the latest practicable date
prior to the publication of this document).

In managing the affairs of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group, the Cable & Wireless Communications
Board is committed to the principles of good corporate governance and is dedicated to achieving high standards
of business integrity, ethics and professionalism across all the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s
activities. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group will have an Ethics Policy that will apply at Cable &
Wireless Communications Board level and to all employees across the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group.

Under the Cable & Wireless Communications Articles, one third of the directors will be required to offer
themselves for re-election at each of the first two annual general meetings after the Demerger. Thereafter, all
directors will be subject to the general rule requiring rotation of directors holding office at the time of the two
preceding annual general meetings if he or she has not been elected or re-elected in that period but will be
eligible for reappointment.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Board comprises nine members: the Chairman, four Executive Directors
and four Non-executive Directors. The Cable & Wireless Communications Board acknowledges that all the
Non-executive Directors are deemed independent in character and judgement under the Combined Code.
Collectively, the Non-executive Directors bring a wide range of skills and experience as they all currently occupy
or have occupied senior positions in industry and public life and, as such, each contributes significant weight to
board decisions.

In line with the Combined Code’s recommendations, Cable & Wireless Communications has appointed Simon
Ball as Senior Independent Director (SID). The SID is charged with establishing a communication channel
between the Chairman and the Non-executive Directors and ensuring that the views of each Non-executive
Director are given due consideration. He also provides a contact point for Cable & Wireless Communications
Shareholders who are concerned that contact through their usual channels of the Chairman or Executive Directors
has failed to resolve any issue which they might have, or for which such contact is inappropriate.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Board has also established audit, remuneration and nomination
committees. The Combined Code requires that all the members of the audit committee and remuneration
committee and a majority of the members of the nominations committee should be independent Non-executive
Directors.

**Audit Committee**

The Audit Committee is comprised entirely of the Non-executive Directors: Simon Ball (Committee Chairman),
Mary Francis, Kasper Rorsted and Kate Nealon.

The terms of reference of the Audit Committee cover such issues as monitoring the effectiveness of internal
control, internal audit and risk management systems, providing accurate financial reporting and overseeing,
reviewing and monitoring management’s conduct and reporting of effective risk management. The terms of
reference also set out the authority of the committee to carry out its duties.

The Audit Committee also ensures that the external auditors remain independent of Cable & Wireless
Communications and assesses annually the external auditors’ independence and objectivity, taking into account
relevant UK professional and regulatory requirements and the relationship with the external auditors as a whole.

**Disclosure Committee**

The Disclosure Committee is chaired by Tim Pennington and includes senior management from finance, legal,
company secretarial and external affairs. The Disclosure Committee is responsible for assisting the Board of
Directors and the Audit Committee to identify and consider disclosure matters in connection with the preparation
of all market releases containing financial information.

**Remuneration Committee**

The Remuneration Committee is comprised of four Non-executive Directors and the Chairman: Mary Francis
(Committee Chairman), Simon Ball, Kate Nealon, Kasper Rorsted and Sir Richard Lapthorne. Upon
Sir Richard’s appointment as Chairman of Cable and Wireless plc, the Chairman was considered independent in
character and judgement.

The Remuneration Committee makes recommendations to the Cable & Wireless Communications Board, within
agreed terms of reference, on the framework of executive remuneration and on the specific remuneration of the
Chairman, Executive Directors and other senior executive management. The Executive Directors and any officers
and the Chairman attending meetings of the Remuneration Committee shall abstain from any discussion on their
own remuneration or contractual arrangements. In determining such policy, the Remuneration Committee takes
into account all factors which it deems necessary.

The Remuneration Committee also reviews and approves the annual salaries, incentive arrangements, service
agreements and other employment conditions for each Executive Director, reviews the remuneration of other
senior executives of Cable & Wireless Communications and approves awards to Executive Directors and other
senior executives of the Cable & Wireless Communications under the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group’s share-based plans. The Remuneration Committee is tasked with ensuring that cost-effective and
responsible remuneration packages are provided which are suitable to attract, motivate and retain members of the
executive management of the company and to encourage enhanced performance and shareholder value.

**Nomination Committee**

The Nomination Committee is chaired by Sir Richard Lapthorne, and the other members are Simon Ball, Kasper
Rorsted, Kate Nealon and Mary Francis. In accordance with the recommendations of the Combined Code, the
majority of the members of the Nomination Committee are independent Non-executive Directors. Sir Richard
Lapthorne, will not chair any meeting at which his own successor as chairman is under review; such meetings
will be chaired by the Deputy Chairman. The Committee will review the balance of Cable & Wireless
Communications Board membership and the required blend of skills, knowledge and experience by considering
its structure, size and composition.

**THE CABLE & WIRELESS LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP)**

The LTIP, which was approved by Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Shareholders in 2006, creates a reward pool
for the businesses of each of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group, depending on the extent to which each business has grown in value from its adjusted base value at 1 April
2006. The LTIP was approved by Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Shareholders on the basis that value could be
delivered in cash or otherwise than in cash.

A participant’s entitlement under the LTIP is calculated by reference to the number of units which he or she has
been awarded.

As at 28 January 2010 (being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this document), there were 12
participants within the Cable & Wireless Communications Group holding awards under the LTIP. The only
member of the Cable & Wireless Communications Board who currently participates under the LTIP is Tony
Rice. The Cable & Wireless Remuneration Committee has determined that Tim Pennington will be granted an
award of 500 Cable & Wireless Communications Group related units under the LTIP shortly after the date of this
document in consideration for Tim Pennington agreeing to waive his performance share award over 1,187,295
Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Shares granted under the IP 2001 in November 2008. These LTIP units will not
confer a right to payment in March 2010.

128


-----

The Cable & Wireless Remuneration Committee has determined that Nick Cooper will be granted an award of
250 Cable & Wireless Communications related units under the LTIP shortly after the date of this document in
consideration for Nick Cooper agreeing to waive his restricted share award over 230,038 Cable and Wireless plc
Ordinary Shares granted under the RSP 2005 that was due to vest in June 2011. These LTIP units will not confer
a right to payment in March 2010.

At the annual general meeting on 17 July 2009 Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Shareholders approved the
extension of the performance period of the LTIP to 31 March 2011. Therefore, there currently remain two more
payments to be made under the LTIP, the payment in respect of 2009/10 and the final payment in respect of
2010/11.

The Cable & Wireless Remuneration Committee’s proposals in respect of the LTIP awards relating to the Cable
& Wireless Communications Group that are held by participants employed in the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group following the Demerger are that, subject to Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary
Shareholders approving certain amendments to the LTIP rules:

(a) the Demerger should not accelerate automatically the vesting of awards under the LTIP. Awards should
continue in respect of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group until the current performance period
ends on 31 March 2011;

(b) awards would continue to be governed by the rules of the LTIP;

(c) the calculation period for the 2010 payments will be the 30 day period ending on the day immediately prior
to the Demerger Effective Date and not 31 March 2010 to avoid a discontinuity in the calculation process;
and

(d) the LTIP will be available for use by the Remuneration Committee to make further awards of unallocated
units following Admission to employees within the Cable & Wireless Communications Group until
31 March 2011.

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS**

The following is a summary of the material terms of certain financing arrangements to which the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group is or is expected to be a party. The following summaries are not complete and
are subject to the full text of the documents described below.

**Cable & Wireless Communications Facility**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group has obtained financing pursuant to the terms of a credit agreement
dated 13 January 2010 (the Cable & Wireless Communications Facility Agreement). The Cable & Wireless
Communications Facility Agreement is between Sable International Finance Limited as borrower (the Facility
**Borrower), various companies in the Cable & Wireless Communications Group as guarantors and various major**
financial institutions as lead arrangers, the financial institutions listed therein as lenders (the Facility Lenders)
and agents (the Agent). The Cable & Wireless Communications Facility Agreement is for the general corporate
purposes of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group.

Pursuant to the Cable & Wireless Communications Facility Agreement, the Facility Lenders have made available
US$400 million to the Facility Borrower by way of a US dollar revolving credit facility (the Cable & Wireless
**Communications Facilities). The Cable & Wireless Communications Facility Agreement also contemplates that**
the Facility Borrower has the option to increase the amount of the Cable & Wireless Communications Facility by
US$100 million.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Facility is guaranteed by Sable Holding Limited, CWIGroup Limited
and CWWI. Cable and Wireless plc has also given a standalone guarantee in support of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Facility. On the earlier of (a) one business day after the Cable & Wireless Communications
Reduction of Capital required as part of the scheme and (b) 14 days after the Scheme Effective Time, a similar
guarantee will be given by Cable & Wireless Communications Plc. The Facility Lenders benefit from a security
package which comprises fixed charges over the shares in the Facility Borrower and each guarantor (other than
Cable and Wireless plc and Cable & Wireless Communications Plc). The security package and the guarantees
will be shared pari passu with the lenders under the Cable & Wireless Communications Term Loan (as defined
below), holders of the Notes and lenders and/or holders in respect of any additional moneys up to an aggregate
amount of US$500 million borrowed or raised by the Facility Borrower from any Facility Lender, third-party
lender and/or pursuant to a further capital markets issue provided that certain conditions are satisfied.

Loans made under the Cable & Wireless Communications Facility Agreement will bear interest at a floating rate
per annum based on the London interbank rate as applicable plus a margin of 3.25% per annum (which may step
up to 3.75% according to the Facility Borrower’s ratio of consolidated net debt to adjusted consolidated
EBITDA). Interest is payable on the last day of each interest period selected by the Facility Borrower or, if
shorter, at six-monthly intervals.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Facility Agreement terminates on 31 March 2013. Loans under the
Cable & Wireless Communications Facilities are prepayable at par at any time at the Facility Borrower’s option,
in whole or in part in a minimum amount of US$20 million and in multiples of US$5 million plus accrued and
unpaid interest and break costs. The Cable & Wireless Communications Facilities are also mandatorily
prepayable on the occurrence of certain events such as a change of control, illegality of a lender and using the
proceeds of disposals other than reinvesting, subject to exceptions.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Facility Agreement contains a number of representations given by the
Facility Borrower and the guarantors in respect of themselves and their subsidiaries, some of which must be true
at the signing date, the date of the Demerger, the date of the Scheme of Arrangement and on each drawing date.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Facility Agreement imposes financial covenants, including certain
financial ratios that the Facility Borrower must maintain and limits on the levels of different types of
indebtedness that may be incurred by members of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group. In particular
but without limitation:

(a) debt of Sable Holding Limited and its subsidiaries (International Group) (excluding the obligors) must at
no time be greater than US$600 million; and

132


-----

(b) members of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group are prohibited from incurring debt unless, on the
date of the incurrence and after giving effect thereto on a pro forma basis, the ratio of consolidated net debt
to adjusted consolidated EBITDA of Cable & Wireless Communications Group is no greater than 2.75:1
and ratio of consolidated net debt of International Group to adjusted consolidated EBITDA of Cable &
Wireless Communications Group is no greater than 2.25:1.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Facility Agreement includes other customary covenants such as
compliance with laws, authorisations, maintenance of existence and payment of taxes. There are also certain
restrictions on the ability of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group to create security, make acquisitions,
cash movements, make distributions and change business, subject to customary carve-outs.

A breach of any of the terms of the Cable & Wireless Communications Facility Agreement and the connected
documents, failure by the Facility Borrower to make any payment due, insolvency events in respect of the Cable
& Wireless Communications Group, cross-default to other debt and various other customary events will
constitute events of default under the Cable & Wireless Communications Facility Agreement. The result of such
an event of default is that the Agent may terminate the commitments under the Cable & Wireless
Communications Facilities, and declare the loans then outstanding due and payable.

**Cable & Wireless Communications Term Loan Facility**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group has obtained financing pursuant to the terms of a credit agreement
dated 13 January 2010 (the Cable & Wireless Communications Term Loan Facility Agreement). The Cable
& Wireless Communications Term Loan Facility Agreement is between Sable International Finance Limited as
borrower (the Term Loan Borrower), various companies in the Cable & Wireless Communications Group as
guarantors and a financial institution as lead arranger and agent, and a major financial institution as lender.

Pursuant to the Cable & Wireless Communications Term Loan Facility Agreement the lenders have made
available US$100 million to the Term Loan Borrower by way of a US dollar term loan facility (the Term Loan
**Facilities, and together with the Cable & Wireless Communications Facilities, the New Credit Facilities).**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Term Loan Facility Agreement is on substantially the same terms,
including guarantees, security package and covenants, as the Cable & Wireless Communications Facility
Agreement, subject to variations including the following;

(a) the Cable & Wireless Communications Term Loan Facility is not a revolving credit facility;

(b) no option to increase the facility;

(c) loans made under the Cable & Wireless Communications Term Loan Facility Agreement will bear interest
at a floating rate per annum based on the London interbank rate as applicable plus a margin of 4.00% per
annum;

(d) mandatory prepayment is required if the aggregate amount of the Cable & Wireless Communications
Facility Agreement, the Cable & Wireless Communications Term Loan Facility and the US$ bond offering
exceeds US$1 billion; and

(e) the margin and/or fees payable under the Cable & Wireless Communications Term Loan Facility Agreement
must match those payable under the Cable & Wireless Communications Bridge Facility from 31 July 2010
onwards.

Each of the Cable & Wireless Communications Facility, the Cable & Wireless Communications Bridge Facility
and the Cable & Wireless Communications Term Loan Facility will remain liabilities of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group upon Demerger.

**Convertible Bonds**

On 24 November 2009, Cable and Wireless plc (the Initial Issuer) issued £230 million convertible bonds due
2014 (the Convertible Bonds).

The Convertible Bonds are senior debt obligations of Cable and Wireless plc and are convertible into fully paid
ordinary shares of Cable and Wireless plc. Upon Worldwide Admission, subject to the satisfaction of the
substitution conditions described below prior to Worldwide Admission and the execution of the Worldwide
Substitution Deed and, unless previously converted, redeemed or purchased and cancelled, the Convertible
Bonds become debt obligations of Cable & Wireless Worldwide and convertible into fully paid ordinary shares
of Cable & Wireless Worldwide.

133


-----

The conditions for the substitution of Cable & Wireless Worldwide as the principal debtor under the Convertible
Bonds upon Worldwide Admission require that a certificate signed by two directors of Cable & Wireless Worldwide
(the Substitution Compliance Certificate) is delivered to the bond trustee on the business day in London prior to the
date of Worldwide Admission, certifying that (i) the total net debt for the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group equals
no more than £225 million; (ii) the total secured bank debt for the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group equals no more
than £200 million; (iii) the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has freely available, uncommitted and unsecured cash
and cash equivalents and available credit facilities of not less than £200 million; and (iv) Cable & Wireless Worldwide
is the ultimate holding company of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group.

The Demerger is conditional upon the delivery by Cable & Wireless Worldwide to the bond trustee of the Substitution
Compliance Certificate. Cable & Wireless Communications will, shortly before Demerger, transfer the proceeds of the
Convertible Bonds to Cable & Wireless Worldwide, thereby allowing Cable & Wireless Worldwide to deliver the
Substitution Compliance Certificate to the bond trustee prior to the Demerger. Pursuant to the terms of the Separation
Agreement, the execution by Cable & Wireless Communications and Cable & Wireless Worldwide of the Worldwide
Substitution Deed which effects the substitution of Cable & Wireless Worldwide as principal debtor in respect of the
Convertible Bonds, will take place no later than immediately prior to the Worldwide Admission in consideration for,
and subject to, Cable & Wireless Communications having, shortly before Demerger (as described above), transferred
such proceeds to Cable & Wireless Worldwide. Therefore, all necessary conditions for the substitution of Cable &
Wireless Worldwide as principal debtor under the Convertible Bonds, subject only to Worldwide Admission taking
place, will have been met, de facto, prior to Worldwide Admission.

In the event that the conditions to transfer the Convertible Bonds to Cable & Wireless Worldwide plc are not met
or the Demerger does not otherwise complete, Cable and Wireless plc (or, subject to the fulfilment of certain
conditions, Cable & Wireless Communications) shall remain principal debtor under the Convertible Bonds and
the Convertible Bond proceeds will be returned to the principal debtor thereunder. The principal debtor under the
Convertible Bonds from time to time is referred to below as the Convertible Issuer. From a date falling prior to
the Scheme Effective Time, to be specified by Cable and Wireless plc by giving five days written notice to
bondholders, conversion rights under the Convertible Bonds will be suspended until the date falling 21 dealing
days following the Worldwide Admission on which the reset conversion price of the Convertible Bonds will be
established. To the extent that the substitution of Cable & Wireless Worldwide as principal debtor under the
Convertible Bonds has not occurred by the earlier of:

(i) 90 days following the effective date of any such suspension of conversion rights by Cable and Wireless plc
or, if earlier, 31 December 2010 or

(ii) the date on which certain change of control events described in the terms of the Convertible Bonds occur,
the terms of the Convertible Bonds provide that the suspension period shall end on the ninetieth day
following the effective date of the suspension of conversion rights by Cable and Wireless plc (or, if earlier,
30 December 2010) or as the case may be, the date of such change of control event.

The Convertible Bonds carry a coupon from and including 24 November 2009 of 5.75% per annum payable
semi-annually in arrears in equal instalments on 30 June and 30 December in each year, with a long first coupon
on 30 June 2010 of £3,440.57 per £100,000 principal amount of the Convertible Bonds and a short last coupon on
the maturity date of £2,309.43 per £100,000 principal amount of the Convertible Bonds, in each case, in respect
of each Convertible Bond. The conversion price is £1.841 per £100,000 principal amount of the Convertible
Bonds and is subject to adjustment from the issue date of the Convertible Bonds. Unless previously redeemed,
converted or purchased and cancelled, the Convertible Bonds will be redeemed on 24 November 2014 at their
principal amount.

The Convertible Bonds contain a negative pledge which provides that, so long as any of the Convertible Bonds
remain outstanding, the Convertible Issuer and its principal subsidiaries will not create or permit to subsist
security upon their respective assets to secure, guarantee or indemnify any other debt instruments that are listed
or capable of being listed. However, in respect of the Initial Issuer and Cable & Wireless Communications Plc
only, this negative pledge does not apply to the creation or subsistence of security in respect of listed
indebtedness of no more than US$500 million. The negative pledge also contains certain other customary
exemptions for the benefit of the Issuer.

Failures to pay all or any part of the principal or interest due in respect of the Convertible Bonds, cross default
and certain other events (linked, inter alia, to insolvency) may constitute events of default under the Convertible
Bonds, subject to customary thresholds and exceptions and, in certain cases, a material prejudice certification
being given by the bond trustee. Such events of default may lead to the acceleration of the repayment of principal
and accrued (but unpaid) interest under the Convertible Bonds.

134


-----

The Convertible Issuer may, subject to certain conditions, redeem all but not some only of the Convertible Bonds
at their principal amount, together with accrued (but unpaid) interest: (a) at any time on or after 15 December
2012, if the value of the ordinary shares deliverable on conversion of a Convertible Bond exceeds 130% of the
principal amount of a Convertible Bond for a prescribed period; or (b) at any time once 85% or more of the
principal amount of the Convertible Bonds have been purchased and cancelled, converted or redeemed.

Payments in respect of the Convertible Bonds are subject to a customary gross-up provision with relevant carveouts applying from the date that the Convertible Bonds are listed. From such listing date, the Convertible Issuer
will benefit from a right to redeem the Convertible Bonds on the occurrence of certain changes in the tax laws or
regulations of the United Kingdom.

For a period of 60 days following a change of control of the Convertible Issuer (or, if later, notice thereof)
excluding, for the avoidance of doubt the Demerger, the conversion price will be adjusted downwards in
accordance with a formula resulting in straight line amortisation of the conversion premium of the Convertible
Bonds. In addition, on a change of control of the Convertible Issuer each holder of Convertible Bonds may
exercise their conversion rights or, instead, require the Convertible Issuer to redeem any Convertible Bond held
by such holder at its principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest.

The Convertible Bonds contain customary anti-dilution adjustment provisions dealing with, inter alia, share
consolidations, share splits, capital distributions, extraordinary dividends, rights issues and bonus issues and
customary undertakings to protect the conversion rights of the Convertible Bonds.

The Convertible Bonds and the Convertible Trust Deed are governed by English law.

An application will be made by the Convertible Issuer for the Convertible Bonds to be admitted to listing on the
Official List of the UK Listing Authority and admitted to trading on the Professional Securities Market of the
London Stock Exchange by no later than 30 June 2010.

and Wireless plc (or its successor) such sterling-denominated bonds (or if such bonds have been redeemed, the
redemption proceeds of such bonds). (See note 27 to the historical financial information of Cable & Wireless
Communications Group in “Historical Financial Information of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group”).
These obligations are not secured on the collateral securing the Notes.

**_Enforcement of Security_**

_Enforcement Instructions_

Subject to the paragraph below, until the date on which all the Secured Debt has been fully and irrevocably paid
or discharged and all commitments in respect of such debt have expired or been cancelled, the security trustee
will (i) exercise any right or power vested in it as security trustee in accordance with any instructions given to it
by the Majority Senior Bank Lenders and (ii) not be liable for any act or omission if it acts or refrains from
taking any action in accordance with an instruction of the Majority Senior Bank Lenders.

Where (i) the Notes finance parties are permitted to take any Enforcement Action and (ii) the Majority Senior
Bank Lenders are not in the process of taking (or instructing the security trustee to take) Enforcement Action in
relation to the security documents, the Threshold will be deemed to have been reached and the trustee and the

it by the Majority Senior Bank Lenders and the holders of the Notes (together, the Majority Senior Lenders)
and (ii) not be liable for any act or omission if it acts or refrains from taking any action in accordance with an
instruction of the Majority Senior Lenders.

Any instructions given in accordance with the two preceding paragraphs will be binding on all the secured
parties. No individual secured party may take any Enforcement Action in relation to the security documents other
than the security trustee in accordance with the intercreditor agreement.

The security trustee may refrain from acting in accordance with any instructions given in accordance with the
two immediately preceding paragraphs until it has received such security as it may require for any cost, loss or
liability (together with any associated VAT) which it may incur in complying with the instructions. In the
absence of instructions, the security trustee may act (or refrain from taking action) as it considers to be in the best
interest of the secured parties. The security trustee is not authorised to act on behalf of a secured party without
first obtaining that party’s consent in any legal or arbitration proceedings relating to any secured document or the
intercreditor agreement. No secured party will be responsible to any other party under the intercreditor agreement
for any instructions given or not given to the security trustee in relation to the security documents.

Communications Facilities, the Cable & Wireless Communications Term Loan Facility or the Permitted Senior
Debt, exercises any of its rights to accelerate or the date on which any such debt is cancelled in full, or the trustee
or any other Notes finance party exercises any equivalent right under the Notes finance documents, the security
trustee (or the relevant obligor or other member of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group in the case of a
disposals referred to above) requires any release of any guarantee or security granted by any obligor or other
member of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group, each party will promptly enter into any release and/or

Cable & Wireless Communications Group in the case of a disposal referred to above) may reasonably require.

**DESCRIPTION OF NOTES**

Sable International Finance Limited (the “Issuer”) will issue US dollar-denominated notes (the “Notes”) under an
indenture (the “Indenture”) among itself, as issuer, Cable and Wireless plc (“Cable and Wireless”), as parent
guarantor, Cable and Wireless’ subsidiaries that guarantee the Notes (the “Subsidiary Guarantors”), Deutsche
Trustee Company Limited, as trustee (the “Trustee”) and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as paying
agent and registrar, in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the US Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the “US Securities Act”). The Notes each constitute a separate series of Notes. Unless
the context requires otherwise, references in this “Description of Notes” to the Notes include any additional
Notes that are issued. See “Transfer Restrictions.” The terms of the Notes include those set forth in the Indenture.
The Indenture will not incorporate or include any of the provisions of the US Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as
amended.

The following description is only a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture, the Notes and the
Security Documents and refers to the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not restate those agreements in their
entirety. You should read the Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement because they,
and not this description, define your rights as holders of the Notes. Copies of the Indenture, the form of Note, the
Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement are available as set forth below under “—Additional
Information.”

Certain defined terms used in this description but not defined below under “—Certain Definitions” have the
meanings assigned to them in the Indenture. You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this description
under the subheading “—Certain Definitions.” In this description, the term “Parent” refers (i) prior to the
consummation of the C&W Communications Scheme, only to Cable and Wireless and not to any of its
Subsidiaries and (ii) following the consummation of the C&W Communications Scheme, only to Cable &
Wireless Communications plc (“C&W Communications”) and not to any of its subsidiaries.

The registered holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered holders will
have rights under the Indenture.

**Brief Description of the Notes and the Note Guarantees**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes:

    - will be general obligations of the Issuer;

    - will be secured as set forth below under “—Security”;

    - will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is secured by
property and assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of the property and assets
securing such Indebtedness;

    - will be pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is not
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

    - will rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; and

    - will be unconditionally guaranteed by the Guarantors.

**_The Note Guarantees_**

The Notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors.

The Note Guarantee of each Guarantor:

    - will be a general obligation of such Guarantor;

    - will be secured as set forth below under “—Security”:

    - will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is
secured by property and assets that do not secure such Note Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the
property and assets securing such Indebtedness;

141


-----

    - will be pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that
is not subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee;

    - will rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is
subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee; and

    - will be effectively senior to all of such Guarantor’s existing and future unsecured Indebtedness to the
extent of the assets securing such Note Guarantee.

Not all of the Parent’s Restricted Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. However, each of the Parent’s
Subsidiaries that guarantee the New Credit Facilities will also guarantee the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy,
liquidation or reorganization of any of these non-guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor Restricted
Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of
their assets to the Guarantors. All of the trading operations of the Indigo Group are carried out through the
Parent’s non-guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries.

The operations of the Parent are conducted through its Restricted Subsidiaries and, therefore, the Parent depends
on the cash flow of its Restricted Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligations under its Note
Guarantee. The Notes will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all Indebtedness and other liabilities
and commitments (including trade and other payables and lease obligations) of the Parent’s non-guarantor
Restricted Subsidiaries. Any right of the Issuer or any Guarantor to receive assets of any of the Parent’s
non-guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries upon that non-guarantor Restricted Subsidiary’s liquidation or
reorganization (and the consequent right of the holders of the Notes to participate in those assets) will be
effectively subordinated to the claims of that non-guarantor Restricted Subsidiary’s creditors, except to the extent
that the Issuer or such Guarantor is itself recognized as a creditor of the non-guarantor Restricted Subsidiary, in
which case the claims of the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be, would still be subordinate in right of
payment to any security in the assets of the non-guarantor Restricted Subsidiary and any Indebtedness of the
non-guarantor Restricted Subsidiary senior to that held by the Issuer or such Guarantor. As of September 30,
2009, the indebtedness of the non-guarantor subsidiaries of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group (other
than the unsecured Existing Bonds due 2019 issued by Cable & Wireless International Finance B.V. and
guaranteed by Cable and Wireless) would have been US$220 million. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the
Notes—The Notes and each of the Note Guarantees will each be structurally subordinated to the liabilities and
preference shares (if any) of our non-guarantor subsidiaries.”

As of the Issue Date, only Subsidiaries of the Parent that will be Subsidiaries of the Parent immediately
following the Worldwide Business Demerger (each of the Parent’s Subsidiaries as of the time of the Worldwide
Business Demerger other than the Worldwide Business Subsidiaries) will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for
purposes of the Indenture. Each of the Worldwide Business Subsidiaries will be designated as “Unrestricted
_Subsidiaries” for so long as they are Subsidiaries of the Parent. The Parent’s Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be_
subject to the restrictive covenants in the Indenture. The Parent’s Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not guarantee the
Notes.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Issuer will issue US$500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes. The Issuer may issue additional
Notes (the “Additional Notes”) under the Indenture from time to time after this offering. Any issuance of
Additional Notes is subject to all of the covenants in the Indenture. The Notes and any Additional Notes
subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture,
including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. The Issuer will issue
Notes in denominations of US$100,000 and integral multiples of US$1,000 in excess thereof. The Notes will
mature on, 2017.

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum. Interest will be payable semi-annually in
arrears on and, commencing on, 2010. Interest on overdue principal and
interest, including Additional Amounts (as defined herein), if any, will accrue at a rate that is 1% higher than the
then applicable interest rate on the Notes. The Issuer will make each interest payment to the holders of record on
the immediately preceding and .

Interest on the Notes will accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been paid, from the
date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve
30-day months.

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a “Paying Agent”) for the Notes in each of (i) the City
of London (the “Principal Paying Agent”), and (ii) the Borough of Manhattan, City of New York. The Issuer will
undertake to maintain a Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union that is not obliged to withhold or
deduct tax pursuant to the European Union Directive 2003/48/EC or any other directive implementing the
conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of 26 and 27 November 2000 on the taxation of savings income, or
any law implementing, or complying with or introduced in order to conform to, such directive. The initial Paying
Agents will be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch in London and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas in
New York.

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (a “Registrar”) with offices in the Borough of Manhattan, City of
New York. The Issuer will also maintain a transfer agent in each of London and New York. The initial Registrar
will be Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas in New York. The initial transfer agent will be Deutsche Bank
AG, London Branch in London and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas in New York. The Registrar and
the transfer agent in New York will maintain a register reflecting ownership of Definitive Registered Notes
outstanding from time to time and will make payments on and facilitate transfer of Definitive Registered Notes
on the behalf of the Issuer. Each transfer agent shall perform the functions of a transfer agent.

The Issuer may change the Paying Agents, the Registrar or the transfer agents without prior notice to the Holders.
For so long as the Notes are listed on the London Stock Exchange and the rules of the London Stock Exchange so
require, the Issuer will publish a notice of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or transfer agent in the manner
required or otherwise permitted by such rules.

**Transfer and Exchange**

Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A (“Rule 144A”) under
the US Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global Notes in registered form without interest
coupons attached (the “144A Global Note”) and Notes and sold outside the United States pursuant to
Regulation S (“Regulation S”) under the US Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global
Notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Reg S Global Note” and together with the 144A
Global Note, the “Global Notes”).

During the 40-day distribution compliance period (as defined in Rule 902 of Regulation S), book-entry interests
in the Regulation S Global Notes may be transferred only to non-US Persons under Regulation S or to persons
whom the transferor reasonably believes are “qualified institutional buyers” within the meaning of Rule 144A in
a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with applicable transfer
restrictions and any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with DTC or Persons that may hold interests through such participants. Ownership of interests in the
Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and certification
requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions.” In addition, transfers of
Book-Entry Interests between participants in DTC will be effected by DTC pursuant to customary procedures
and subject to the applicable rules and procedures and its respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Note, or the “Restricted Book-Entry Interests,” may be transferred to a
person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Reg S Global Note and 144A Global Note,
as applicable, or the “Reg S Book-Entry Interests,” only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification
(in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with
Regulation S.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a
Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it
will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Note to which it was transferred.

143


-----

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of $100,000
principal amount and integral multiples $1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the applicable Registrar of
instructions relating thereto and any certificates and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected
that such instructions will be based upon directions received by DTC from the participant which owns the
relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will,
except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law,
be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described
more fully under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be
transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of US$100,000 in principal amount and
integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof, to persons who take delivery thereof in the form of Definitive
Registered Notes. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or
exchanging holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, furnish
information regarding the account of the transferee at DTC furnish certain certificates and opinions, and pay any
Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge
to the holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer or exchange.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer of any Definitive Registered
Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or

(4) which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control
Offer.

**Additional Amounts**

All payments made under or with respect to the Notes (whether or not in the form of Definitive Registered Notes)
or with respect to any Note Guarantee will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or
on account of, any present or future Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by
law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of any
jurisdiction in which the Issuer or any Guarantor (including any surviving corporation), is then incorporated,
engaged in business or resident for tax purposes or any political subdivision thereof or therein or any jurisdiction
from or through which payment is made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including, without
limitation, the jurisdiction of any paying agent) (each, a “Tax Jurisdiction”), will at any time be required to be
made from any payments made under or with respect to the Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee,
including, without limitation, payments of principal, redemption price, purchase price, interest or premium, the
Issuer, the relevant Guarantor or other payor, as applicable, will pay such additional amounts (the “Additional
_Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments by each holder_
(including Additional Amounts) after such withholding, deduction or imposition will equal the respective
amounts that would have been received in respect of such payments in the absence of such withholding or
deduction; provided, however, that no Additional Amounts will be payable with respect to:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been imposed but for the holder or the beneficial owner of the Notes being a
citizen or resident or national of, incorporated in or carrying on a business, in the relevant Tax Jurisdiction
in which such Taxes are imposed or having any other present or former connection with the relevant Tax
Jurisdiction other than the mere acquisition, holding, enforcement or receipt of payment in respect of the
Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee;

(2) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld as a result of the failure of the holder of the Note or beneficial
owner of the Notes to comply with any reasonable written request, made to that holder or beneficial owner
in writing at least 90 days before any such withholding or deduction would be payable, by the Issuer or any
of the Guarantors to provide timely and accurate information concerning the nationality, residence or
identity of such Holder or beneficial owner or to make any valid and timely declaration or similar claim or
satisfy any certification information or other reporting requirement, which is required or imposed by a
statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the relevant Tax Jurisdiction as a precondition to any
exemption from or reduction in all or part of such Taxes to which such Holder is entitled;

144


-----

(3) any Note presented for payment (where Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and
presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available for payment to
the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the
Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period);

(4) any estate, inheritance, gift, sale, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(5) any Taxes withheld, deducted or imposed on a payment to an individual and that are required to be made
pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other directive implementing the conclusions of
the ECOFIN Council meeting of 26 and 27 November 2000 on the taxation of savings income or any law
implementing or complying with or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive;

(6) any Note presented for payment by or on behalf of a holder of Notes who would have been able to avoid
such withholding or deduction by presenting the relevant Note to another Paying Agent in a member state of
the European Union;

(7) any Taxes payable other than by deduction or withholding from payments under, or with respect to, the
Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee; or

(8) any combination of items (1) through (7) above.

In addition to the foregoing, the Issuer and the Guarantors will also pay and indemnify the holder for any present
or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or any other excise or property taxes, charges or
similar levies or Taxes which are levied by any Tax Jurisdiction on the execution, delivery, registration or
enforcement of any of the Notes, the Indenture, any Note Guarantee, or any other document or instrument
referred to therein.

If the Issuer or any Guarantor, as the case may be, becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional
Amounts with respect to any payment under or with respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee, the Issuer or the
relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, will deliver to the Trustee on a date that is at least 30 days prior to the
date of that payment (unless the obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises after the 30th day prior to that
payment date, in which case the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor shall notify the Trustee promptly thereafter) an
Officers’ Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so
payable. The Officers’ Certificate must also set forth any other information reasonably necessary to enable the
Paying Agents to pay Additional Amounts to holders on the relevant payment date. The Trustee shall be entitled
to rely solely on such Officers’ Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary. The Issuer or
the relevant Guarantor will provide the Trustee with documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee
evidencing the payment of Additional Amounts.

The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will make all withholdings and deductions required by law and will remit
the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Tax authority in accordance with applicable law. Upon
request, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will provide to the Trustee an official receipt or, if official receipts
are not obtainable, other documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee evidencing the payment of any
Taxes so deducted or withheld. The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will attach to each certified copy or other
document a certificate stating the amount of such Taxes paid per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding. Upon request, copies of those receipts or other documentation, as the case may be, will be made
available by the Trustee to the holders of the Notes.

Whenever in the Indenture or in this “Description of Notes” there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of
amounts based upon the principal amount of the Notes or of principal, interest or of any other amount payable
under, or with respect to, any of the Notes or Note Guarantee, such mention shall be deemed to include mention
of the payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would
be payable in respect thereof.

**Note Guarantees**

The Notes will initially be guaranteed by Cable and Wireless and the Subsidiary Guarantors. Following the
completion of the C&W Communications Scheme, the Notes will also be guaranteed by C&W Communications.
These Note Guarantees will be joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. The obligations of each Guarantor
under its Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent that Note Guarantee from constituting a
fraudulent conveyance under applicable law. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—Each Note
Guarantee will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject
to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.”

145


-----

The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor (other than any direct or indirect parent entity of the Issuer) will be released:

(1) in connection with any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all
of the assets of that Subsidiary Guarantor (including by way of merger, consolidation, amalgamation or
combination) to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Parent, any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries or an Affiliate of the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(2) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Capital Stock of that Subsidiary Guarantor to a Person
that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Parent, any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries or an Affiliate of the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(3) upon repayment in full of the Notes; or

(4) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as provided below
under the captions “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge.”

The Note Guarantee of any direct or indirect parent entity of the Issuer (including C&W Communications, Cable
and Wireless and Sable Holding Limited) will be released:

(1) upon repayment in full of the Notes; or

(2) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as provided below
under the captions “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge.”

**Security**

**_General_**

The Notes and the Note Guarantees will be secured by first-ranking Liens over the Collateral. The Collateral
initially will consist of all of the Capital Stock of the Issuer and each of Sable Holdings Limited, CWIGroup
Limited and Cable and Wireless (West Indies) Limited. The Collateral will be pledged pursuant to the Security
Documents to the Security Agent on behalf of the holders of the Secured Obligations that are secured by the
Collateral, including holders of the Notes.

Under the Indenture, the Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to incur certain additional
Indebtedness in the future which may share in the Collateral, including additional Permitted Collateral Liens
securing Indebtedness on a pari passu basis with the Notes, including, among other Indebtedness, Indebtedness
under the New Credit Facilities and certain Hedging Obligations. The amount of such Permitted Collateral Liens
will be limited by the covenants described under the captions “—Certain Covenants—Liens.” The amount of
such additional Indebtedness secured by the Collateral could be significant.

The proceeds from the sale of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the holders
of the Notes. No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with this offering of the Notes. By its
nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value.
Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See “Risk Factors—
Risks Relating to the Notes—Your rights to enforce remedies with respect to the collateral securing the Notes
and the Note Guarantees are limited as long as any senior bank debt is outstanding” and “Risk Factors—Risks
Relating to the Notes—Your ability to recover under the share pledges constituting the collateral securing the
Notes may be limited.”

The enforcement of the Collateral will be governed by, and subject to the terms and conditions of, the
Intercreditor Agreement as more fully described under the caption “Description of Certain Financing
Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

**_Security Documents_**

The Issuer, the Guarantors and the Security Agent will, as applicable, enter into Security Documents defining the
terms of the Liens that secure the Notes and the Note Guarantees and the other Obligations that will be secured
by the Collateral. Subject to the terms of, and limitations under, the Security Documents, these security interests
will secure the payment and performance when due of the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the
Notes, the Indenture, the Note Guarantees and the Security Documents.

146


-----

Subject to the terms of the Indenture and the Security Documents, the Issuer and the Guarantors will have the
right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Notes and to collect,
invest and dispose of any income therefrom.

The Security Documents will, as described under the caption “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
Intercreditor Agreement”, permit the agents for the New Credit Facilities to instruct the Security Agent to take
enforcement action under the Security Documents following the occurrence of an event of default under such
Indebtedness, such Indebtedness being declared due and payable and the requisite approval or consent of the
holders of such Indebtedness. The Intercreditor Agreement will limit the ability of the Trustee to instruct the
Security Agent to take enforcement action.

**_Release of Security_**

The Collateral may be released:

(1) in connection with any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of such Collateral to a
Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Parent, any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries or an Affiliate of the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(2) if such Collateral is an asset of a Subsidiary Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries, in connection with any sale
or other disposition of Capital Stock of that Subsidiary Guarantor to a Person that is not (either before or
after giving effect to such transaction) the Parent, any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or an Affiliate of the
Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(3) upon repayment in full of the Notes; or

(4) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as provided below
under the captions “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge.”

In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for release of the Collateral upon an enforcement sale as
provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
Agreement—Release of Security and Guarantees.”

**Intercreditor Agreement**

On the Issue Date, the Trustee shall accede to the Intercreditor Agreement previously entered into with, among
others, the creditors under the New Credit Facilities and the counterparties to certain Hedging Obligations, as
described under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” The Intercreditor
Agreement will, among other things, limit the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes from taking
enforcement action until expiration of a standstill period.

**Optional Redemption**

At any time prior to, 2014, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem all or a part of the
Notes, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount of the Notes redeemed, plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of redemption, subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date.

Except pursuant to the preceding paragraph, the Notes will not be redeemable at the Issuer’s option prior to
, 2014.

On or after, 2014, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem all or a part of the Notes,
upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of
principal amount) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes
redeemed, to the applicable date of redemption, if redeemed during the twelve month period beginning on
of the years indicated below, subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive
interest on the relevant interest payment date:

**Year** **Redemption Price**

147


-----

Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or
portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

Any redemption and notice may, in the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more
conditions precedent.

**Redemption for Changes in Taxes**

The Issuer may redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, at its discretion at any time upon giving not less than
30 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice to the holders of the Notes (which notice will be irrevocable and given in
accordance with the procedures described in “—Selection and Notice”), at a redemption price equal to the
principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed by the Issuer for
redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) and all Additional Amounts (if any) then due and which will become due
on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise (subject to the right of holders of the
Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date and Additional
Amounts (if any) in respect thereof), if on the next date on which any amount would be payable in respect of the
Notes, the Issuer is or would be required to pay Additional Amounts or the Guarantors would be unable for
reasons outside their control to procure payment by the Issuer or another Guarantor and in making payment itself
the relevant Guarantor would be required to pay Additional Amounts, and the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as
applicable, cannot avoid any such payment obligation taking reasonable measures available, and the requirement
arises as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the laws or treaties (or any regulations, or rulings promulgated thereunder)
of the relevant Tax Jurisdiction (as defined above) affecting taxation which change or amendment has not
been publicly announced as formally proposed before and which becomes effective on or after the date of
this offering memorandum (or, if the relevant Tax Jurisdiction was not a Tax Jurisdiction on the Issue Date,
the date on which the then current Tax Jurisdiction became the applicable Tax Jurisdiction under the
Indenture); or

(2) any change in, or amendment to, the existing official position or the introduction of an official position
regarding the application, administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings
(including a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published
practice), which change, amendment, application or interpretation has not been publicly announced as
formally proposed before and becomes effective on or after the date of this offering memorandum (or, if the
relevant Tax Jurisdiction was not a Tax Jurisdiction on the Issue Date, the date on which the then current
Tax Jurisdiction became the applicable Tax Jurisdiction under the Indenture).

The Issuer will not give any such notice of redemption earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the
Issuer would be obligated to make such payment or withholding if a payment in respect of the Notes were then
due, and at the time such notice is given, the obligation to pay Additional Amounts must remain in effect. Prior
to the publication or, where relevant, mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing,
the Issuer will deliver the Trustee an opinion of independent tax counsel, the choice of such counsel to be subject
to the prior written approval of the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) to the effect that
there has been such change or amendment which would entitle the Issuer to redeem the Notes hereunder. In
addition, before the Issuer publishes or mails notice of redemption of the Notes as described above, it will deliver
to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate to the effect that it cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional Amounts
by the Issuer taking reasonable measures available to it.

The Trustee will accept such Officers’ Certificate and opinion of counsel as sufficient evidence of the existence
and satisfaction of the conditions precedent as described above, in which event it will be conclusive and binding
on the holders.

For the avoidance of doubt, the implementation of European Council Directive 2003/48/EC on any other
directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of 26 and 27 November 2000 on the
taxation of savings income or any law implementing or complying with or introduced in order to conform to,
such directive will not be a change or amendment for such purposes.

**Mandatory Redemption**

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.

148


-----

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

**_Change of Control_**

If a Change of Control occurs, each holder of Notes will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or
any part (equal to US$100,000 or an integral multiple of US$1,000 in excess thereof) of that holder’s Notes
pursuant to a Change of Control Offer on the terms set forth in the Indenture. In the Change of Control Offer, the
Issuer will offer a payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes repurchased to the date of purchase
(the “Change of Control Payment”), subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the
Issuer will mail a notice to each holder describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of
Control and offering to repurchase Notes on the date (the “Change of Control Payment Date”) specified in the
notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed or
delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice.

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the US Exchange Act and any other applicable
securities laws and regulations to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the
repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws
or regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the
applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the
Change of Control provisions of the Indenture the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control
Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agents an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or
portions of Notes properly tendered; and

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with an Officers’
Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being purchased by the
Issuer.

The Paying Agent will promptly mail to each holder of Notes properly tendered the Change of Control Payment
for such Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to
each holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any.
The Issuer will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the
Change of Control Payment Date.

The provisions described above that require the Issuer to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of
Control will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as
described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the
holders of the Notes to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover,
recapitalization or similar transaction.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (1) a third party
makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases
all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer, or (2) notice of redemption
has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described above under the caption “—Optional Redemption,” unless
and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance
of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement
is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.

The Issuer’s ability to repurchase the Notes pursuant to the Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number
of factors. The ability of the Issuer to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a Change
of Control may be limited by the Parent Guarantor’s and its Restricted Subsidiaries’ then existing financial
resources, and sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. We

149


-----

expect that we would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of
Control. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer
to purchase Notes would constitute a Default under the Indenture, which could, in turn, constitute a default under
the New Credit Facilities and other Indebtedness. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—The Issuer
may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance the change of control offer required by the
indenture governing the Notes.”

The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer,
conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of the Parent and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially
all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a
holder of Notes to require the Issuer to repurchase its Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or
other disposition of less than all of the assets of the Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person
or group may be uncertain.

Subject as provided in the Indenture, notices to holders relating to the Change of Control Offer will be published
in a leading English language daily newspaper circulating in the United Kingdom (which is expected to be the
_Financial Times) or, if in the opinion of the Trustee such publication shall not be practicable, in an English_
language newspaper of general circulation in Europe. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as the Notes are
represented by Global Notes held on behalf of DTC notices to holders may be given by delivery of the relevant
notice to that clearing system for communication by it to entitled account holders in substitution for publication
as required by the Indenture; provided that, so long as the Notes are admitted to the Official List and admitted to
trading on the London Stock Exchange, the notice requirements of the United Kingdom Listing Authority and the
London Stock Exchange have been complied with.

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee will select Notes for redemption on a pro
rata basis (or, in the case of Notes issued in global form as discussed under “—Book-Entry, Delivery and Form,”
based on a method that most nearly approximates a pro rata selection as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate)
unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or depository requirements.

No Notes of $100,000 or less can be redeemed in part. Notices of redemption will be mailed by first class mail at
least 30 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of Notes to be redeemed at its
registered address, except that redemption notices may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if
the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note will state the portion
of the principal amount of that Note that is to be redeemed. A new Note in principal amount equal to the
unredeemed portion of the original Note will be issued in the name of the holder of Notes upon cancellation of
the original Note. Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the
redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes called for redemption.

For Notes represented by Global Notes held on behalf of DTC notices may be given by delivery of the relevant
notices to that clearing system for communication by it to entitled account holders in substitution for the
aforesaid mailing; provided that, so long as the Notes are admitted to the Official List and admitted to trading on
the London Stock Exchange, the notice and disclosure requirements of the United Kingdom Listing Authority
and the London Stock Exchange have been complied with.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Limitation on Certain Indebtedness_**

Except as set forth below in the second and third paragraphs of this “Limitation on Certain Indebtedness”
covenant, the Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly,
create, incur, issue, assume, guarantee, or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable with respect to
(collectively, “incur”) any Public Debt or any Indebtedness under Credit Facilities; provided that (1) the Issuer or
any Guarantor may incur such Indebtedness; and (2) the Issuer and any Guarantor may guarantee such
Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor.

150


-----

In addition and except as set forth below in the third paragraph of this “Limitation on Certain Indebtedness”
covenant, the Parent will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that are not either a Guarantor or the Issuer
to incur any Indebtedness or issue any preferred stock; provided however that any such Restricted Subsidiaries of
the Parent that are not either a Guarantor or the Issuer may incur Indebtedness (other than Internationally
Syndicated Indebtedness) or issue preferred stock if on the date of such incurrence or issuance and on a pro
_forma basis (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom) each of (a) the Consolidated_
Non-Guarantor Leverage Ratio of the Parent is less than 0.75 to 1 and (b) the Consolidated Senior Secured/NonGuarantor Leverage Ratio of the Parent is less than 3.00 to 1.

Notwithstanding the preceeding two paragraphs, the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur Permitted
Indebtedness.

Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will incur any Public Debt that is secured by a Permitted Collateral Lien
unless (1) the holders of such Public Debt shall accede to the Intercreditor Agreement and (2) such Public Debt
will be subject to substantially similar provisions as contained in the Intercreditor Agreement applicable to Notes
Debt (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement). In addition, neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will incur any
Public Debt unless the holders of such Public Debt agree to be subject to a standstill on enforcement no more
favorable to the holders of such Public Debt than the standstill on enforcement then in effect with respect to the
holders of the Notes as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement.

For purposes of determining compliance with this “Limitation on Certain Indebtedness” covenant, in the event
that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in
clauses (1) through (16) of the definition thereof, or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to the second paragraph of
this covenant, the Parent will be permitted to classify such item of Indebtedness on the date of its incurrence or
later reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, in any manner that complies with this covenant. The
accrual of interest or preferred stock dividends, the accretion or amortisation of original issue discount, the
payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, the
reclassification of preferred stock as Indebtedness due to a change in accounting principles, and the payment of
dividends on preferred stock in the form of additional shares of the same class of preferred stock will not be
deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of preferred stock for purposes of this covenant;
_provided, in each such case, that the amount of any such accrual, accretion or payment is included as Senior_
Secured Debt or Non-Guarantor Debt of the Parent, as the case may be, as and when accrued. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Parent or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result
of fluctuations in exchange rates or currency values.

The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be:

(1) the accreted value of the Indebtedness, in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount;

(2) the principal amount of the Indebtedness, in the case of any other Indebtedness; and

(3) in respect of Indebtedness of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets of the specified Person, the
lesser of (a) the Fair Market Value of such assets at the date of determination; and (b) the amount of the
Indebtedness of the other Person.

**_Anti-Layering_**

Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will incur any Indebtedness that is contractually subordinated in right of
payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor unless such Indebtedness is also contractually
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and the applicable Note Guarantee on substantially identical terms;
_provided, however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to_
any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being
secured on a junior priority basis.

**_Liens_**

The Parent will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly,
create, incur, assume or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any Lien of any kind securing
Indebtedness upon any of their property or assets, now owned or hereafter acquired, except (1) in the case of any
property or asset that does not constitute Collateral, Permitted Liens or, if such Lien is not a Permitted Lien, to
the extent that all payments due under the Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees are secured on an equal
and ratable pari passu basis with the obligations so secured (and if such obligations so secured are subordinated

151


-----

in right of payment to either the Notes or any Note Guarantee, on a senior priority basis) until such time as such
obligations are no longer secured by a Lien and (2) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral,
Permitted Collateral Liens.

**_Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets_**

None of the Parent, Cable and Wireless or Sable Holding Limited will, directly or indirectly: (1) consolidate or
merge with or into another Person (whether or not the Parent, Cable and Wireless or Sable Holding Limited, as
the case may be, is the surviving corporation), or (2) sell, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of all or
substantially all of the properties or assets of the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in one
or more related transactions, to another Person, unless:

(1) either: (a) the Parent, Cable and Wireless or Sable Holding Limited, as the case may be, is the surviving
corporation; or (b) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the
Parent, Cable and Wireless or Sable Holding Limited, as the case may be) or to which such sale,
assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition has been made is organised or existing under the laws
of the jurisdiction of the entity being merged into such Person, any member state of the European Union,
Switzerland, the United States, any state of the United States or the District of Columbia, the Cayman
Islands, Jersey, Guernsey or the British Virgin Islands;

(2) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Parent, Cable and
Wireless or Sable Holding Limited, as the case may be) or the Person to which such sale, assignment,
transfer, conveyance or other disposition has been made assumes all the obligations of the Parent, Cable and
Wireless or Sable Holding Limited, as the case may be, under the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Security Documents to which the Parent, Cable and Wireless or Sable Holding Limited,
as the case may be, is a party pursuant to agreements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee;

(3) immediately after such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists; and

(4) the Parent delivers to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate and opinion of counsel, in each case, stating that
such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture comply with this covenant.

The Issuer will not, directly or indirectly: (1) consolidate or merge with or into another Person (whether or not
the Issuer is the surviving corporation), or (2) sell, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of all or
substantially all of the properties or assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries that are Restricted Subsidiaries taken
as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to another Person, unless:

(1) either: (a) the Issuer is the surviving corporation; or (b) the Person formed by or surviving any such
consolidation or merger (if other than the Issuer) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or
other disposition has been made is an entity organized or existing under the laws of any member state of the
European Union, Switzerland, the United States, any state of the United States or the District of Columbia,
the Cayman Islands, Jersey, Guernsey or the British Virgin Islands;

(2) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Issuer) or the Person
to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition has been made assumes all the
obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security
Documents to which the Issuer is a party pursuant to agreements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee;

(3) immediately after such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists;

(4) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate and opinion of counsel, in each case, stating that
such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture comply with this covenant.

A Subsidiary Guarantor (other than Sable Holding Limited and, after the C&W Communications Scheme, Cable
and Wireless) may not consolidate with or merge with or into (whether or not such Subsidiary Guarantor is the
surviving Person) another Person, other than the Issuer, the Parent or another Subsidiary Guarantor, unless:

(1) immediately after giving effect to that transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists; and

(2) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger assumes all the obligations of that
Subsidiary Guarantor under its Note Guarantee, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security
Documents to which such Subsidiary Guarantor is a party pursuant to agreements reasonably satisfactory to
the Trustee.

In addition, none of the Issuer, the Parent, Cable and Wireless or Sable Holdings Limited will, directly or
indirectly, lease all or substantially all of the properties and assets of it and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a
whole, in one or more related transactions, to any other Person.

152


-----

Clause (3) of the first and second paragraphs of this covenant and clause (1) of the third paragraph of this
covenant will not apply to (1) any transaction in which such other Person is the Issuer or a Guarantor or (2) any
merger or consolidation of the Issuer with or into, or the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer to, an Affiliate solely for the purpose of
reincorporating the Issuer in another jurisdiction.

For the avoidance of doubt, this covenant will not apply to the consummation of the Worldwide Business
Demerger and the C&W Communications Scheme as described in the C&W Communications Scheme
Documents.

**_Limitation on Issuances of Guarantees of Indebtedness_**

The Parent will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to guarantee, assume
or in any manner become liable with respect to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor unless such
Restricted Subsidiary simultaneously executes and delivers a supplemental indenture providing for the Guarantee
of the payment of the Notes by such Restricted Subsidiary, which Guarantee will be senior to or pari passu with
such Restricted Subsidiary’s guarantee of such other Indebtedness.

Each additional Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to
guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial
assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of
creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent shall not be obligated to cause such Restricted Subsidiary to Guarantee
the Notes to the extent that such Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary would reasonably be expected to give
rise to or result in a violation of applicable law which, in any case, cannot be prevented or otherwise avoided
through measures reasonably available to the Parent or the Restricted Subsidiary or any liability for the officers,
directors or shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary.

Any additional Note Guarantee will automatically and unconditionally be released under the same conditions and
circumstances that the guarantee of other Indebtedness will be released, so long as no Default or Event of Default
would arise as a result and no other Indebtedness is at that time guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor.

**_Limitation on Activities Pending the Worldwide Business Demerger_**

Prior to the consummation of the Worldwide Business Demerger and other than the Permitted Worldwide
Transactions, the Parent will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to:

(1) enter into, or make or amend, or become party to, any agreement, contract, arrangement or understanding
with any Unrestricted Subsidiary unless the terms of any such agreement, contract, arrangement or
understanding are no less favorable to the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary than those that might be
obtained at the time from Persons who are not Affiliates of the Parent;

(2) subscribe for additional Equity Interests of any Unrestricted Subsidiary other than the subscription by C&W
Communications in Equity Interests in Cable & Wireless UK Holdings Limited in consideration of certain
transactions and/or transfers in connection with the Worldwide Business Demerger;

(3) maintain or preserve the financial condition of any Unrestricted Subsidiary or cause any Unrestricted
Subsidiary to achieve any specified levels of operating results; or

(4) guarantee or otherwise directly or indirectly provide credit support for any Indebtedness of any Unrestricted
Subsidiary.

The Parent will use, and will cause its Restricted Subsidiaries to use, reasonable best efforts to obtain the
requisite approvals and, upon receipt of the requisite approvals, to complete the C&W Communications Scheme
and the Worldwide Business Demerger as soon as commercially practicable and in accordance with the terms of
the C&W Communications Scheme Documents and the Worldwide Business Demerger Documents, respectively.

The Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, amend or modify any of the C&W
Communications Scheme Documents and/or the Worldwide Business Demerger Documents to the extent such
that any such amendment or modification could reasonably be deemed to be materially adverse to the holders of
the Notes than the C&W Communications Scheme Documents or the Worldwide Business Demerger Document,
as the case may be, as in effect on the Issue Date.

153


-----

**_Limitation on Issuer Activities_**

The Issuer will at all times remain a wholly-owned direct or indirect Restricted Subsidiary of the Parent. The
Issuer will not (1) merge, consolidate, amalgamate or otherwise combine with or into another Person (whether or
not the Issuer is the surviving corporation) or, (2) other than in connection with the incurrence of a Permitted
Collateral Lien, sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of any material property or assets to any
Person in one or more related transactions, in each case, except in accordance with the covenant described under
the caption “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets”.

For so long as any Notes are outstanding, none of the Parent nor any of its Restricted Subsidiaries will commence
or take any action or facilitate a winding-up, liquidation or other analogous proceeding in respect of the Issuer.

**_Limitation on Holding Company Activities_**

Following the C&W Communications Scheme, C&W Communications will not carry on any business or own
any assets other than:
(1) ownership or holding any assets or property consisting of cash and Cash Equivalents, Capital Stock in Cable
and Wireless and other assets that are de minimis in nature;
(2) the provision of services (including treasury services) to its Subsidiaries and other Persons in which C&W
Communications owns stock of a type customarily provided by a holding company and activities related or
reasonably incidental to the establishment and/or maintenance of its corporate existence and that of any such
Persons;
(3) incurring Indebtedness (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any guarantees of Indebtedness) permitted
under the covenant described above under the caption “—Limitation on Certain Indebtedness” (including
activities reasonably incidental thereto, including performance of the terms and conditions of such
Indebtedness and the investment (including, without limitation, by loan) of the proceeds from such
Indebtedness in Subsidiaries of the Parent to the extent such activities are otherwise permissible under the
Indenture);
(4) providing guarantees (other than for Indebtedness);
(5) rights and obligations arising under any finance document relating to indebtedness incurred (including with
respect to any guarantee of Indebtedness) to which it is a party and any activity undertaken with the purpose
of, and related to, fulfilling any other obligations under such Indebtedness permitted under the Indenture;
(6) ownership, holding, investing, managing or disposing of any assets held by C&W Communications upon
completion of the C&W Communications Scheme or in connection with, contemplated by or otherwise

(7) ownership or holding of Equity Interests in Subsidiaries of the Parent and other Persons; provided that
(other than with respect to (i) any Subsidiaries and Equity Interests of other Persons directly held by the
Parent upon completion of the C&W Communications Scheme, (ii) any other Subsidiaries permitted to be
held pursuant to the preceding clause (1) and (iii) Equity Interests in Cable & Wireless UK Holdings
Limited held by the Parent as permitted by clause (2) of the covenant described under the caption
“—Limitation on Activities Pending the Worldwide Business Demerger”) the Equity Interests of such
Subsidiaries and other Persons is pledged as additional Collateral to secure the Obligations under the
Indenture, the Notes and the Notes Guarantees.

Cable and Wireless will not carry on any business or own any assets other than:
(1) ownership or holding any assets or property consisting of cash and Cash Equivalents, Capital Stock in Sable
Holdings Limited and any other direct Subsidiary as of the Issue Date and other assets that are de minimis in
nature;
(2) the provision of services (including treasury services) to its Subsidiaries and other Persons in which Cable
and Wireless owns stock of a type customarily provided by a holding company and activities related or
reasonably incidental to the establishment and/or maintenance of its corporate existence and that of any such
Persons;
(3) incurring Indebtedness (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any guarantees of Indebtedness) permitted
under the covenant described above under the caption “—Limitation on Certain Indebtedness” (including
activities reasonably incidental thereto, including performance of the terms and conditions of such
Indebtedness and the investment (including, without limitation, by loan) of the proceeds from such
Indebtedness in Subsidiaries of Cable and Wireless to the extent such activities are otherwise permissible

(4) providing guarantees (other than for Indebtedness);

154


-----

(5) rights and obligations arising under any finance document relating to indebtedness incurred (including with

of, and related to, fulfilling any other obligations under such Indebtedness permitted under the Indenture;

(6) ownership, holding, investing, managing or disposing of any assets held by Cable and Wireless as of the

(7) ownership or holding of Equity Interests in Subsidiaries of Cable and Wireless and other Persons; provided
that, other than with respect to any Subsidiaries and Equity Interests of other Persons directly held by Cable
and Wireless as of the Issue Date or upon completion of the C&W Communications Scheme and any other
Subsidiaries permitted to be held pursuant to the preceding clause (1), the Equity Interests of such
Subsidiaries and other Persons is pledged as additional Collateral to secure the Obligations under the
Indenture, the Notes and the Notes Guarantees.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Parent will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, take or knowingly or
negligently omit to take, any action, which action or omission might or would have the result of materially
impairing the security interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood that the incurrence of Liens on
the Collateral permitted by the definition of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed
to materially impair the security interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the
holders of the Notes, and the Parent will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,
grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes, and
the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, any interest
whatsoever in any of the Collateral; provided that (a) nothing in this provision shall restrict the discharge, release
or replacement of any Collateral in compliance with the terms of the Indenture as described under “—Security—
Releases” and “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” or in compliance with the applicable provisions of the
Intercreditor Agreement and (b) the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur Permitted Collateral Liens;
and provided further, however, a Security Document may be amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified or released (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least
equivalent ranking over the same assets) if, contemporaneously with such amendment, extension, replacement,
restatement, supplement, modification or renewal, the Parent delivers to the Trustee either (1) a solvency
opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee confirming the solvency of the Parent and
its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment,
extension, renewal, supplement, modification or replacement or (2) an opinion of counsel, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (subject to customary exceptions and qualifications), confirming that, after
giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement,
modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens securing the Notes created under the Security Documents so
amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified or replaced are valid and perfected Liens not
otherwise subject to any limitation imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, and that such Lien
or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, modification or replacement which shall be substantially in the form attached to the Indenture. In the
event that the Parent complies with this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary
protections and indemnifications) consent to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement,
modification or replacement with no need for instructions from holders of the Notes.

For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing does not apply to any reduction, fluctuation or impairment of the value
of any asset constituting Collateral.

**_C&W Communications Guarantee_**

C&W Communications shall become a Guarantor no later than the earlier of (1) the day falling one business day
after the Capital Reduction; and (2) 14 days after the date the C&W Communications Scheme has become
effective.

**_Security Matters_**

The Parent shall, and shall procure that each of its Restricted Subsidiaries shall, at its own expense, execute and
do all such acts and things and provide such assurances as the Security Agent may reasonable require (i) for
registering any Security Documents in any required register and for perfecting or protecting the security intended
to be afforded by such Security Documents; and (ii) if such Security Documents have become enforceable, for

155


-----

facilitating the realization of all or any part of the assets which are subject to such Security Documents and for
facilitating the exercise of all powers, authorities and discretions vested in the Security Agent or in any receiver
of all or any part of those assets. The Parent shall, and shall procure that each of its Restricted Subsidiaries shall,
execute all transfers, conveyances, assignments and releases of that property whether to the Security Agent or to
its nominees and give all notices, order and directions which Security Agent may reasonably request.

**_Payments for Consent_**

The Parent will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, pay
or cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any holder of Notes for or as an inducement to any
consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the Indenture or the Notes unless such
consideration is offered to be paid and is paid to all holders of the Notes that consent, waive or agree to amend in
the time frame set forth in the solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or agreement.

**_Maintenance of Listing_**

The Issuer will use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the listing of the Notes on the London Stock Exchange
for so long as such Notes are outstanding; provided that if at any time the Issuer determines that it can no longer
reasonably comply with the requirements for listing on the London Stock Exchange or if maintenance of listing
thereon becomes unduly onerous, it will obtain, prior to the delisting of the Notes from the London Stock
Exchange, and thereafter use its reasonable best efforts to maintain, a listing of such Notes on such other
“recognised stock exchange” as defined in Section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007 of the United Kingdom.

**_Reports_**

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Parent will furnish to the holders of Notes or cause the Trustee to

2010, annual reports containing the following information: (a) audited consolidated balance sheets of the

which should include (i) a balanced and comprehensive analysis of the development and performance of
the Parent’s business during the financial year, (ii) analysis using financial key performance indicators and

financial year; and

-----

(3) promptly after the occurrence of any material acquisition, disposition or restructuring of the Parent and the
Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any senior management changes at the Parent or any Subsidiary
Guarantor or change in auditors of the Parent or the Issuer or any other material event, in each case, that the
Parent announces publicly, a report containing a description of such event.

All financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS. Except as provided for above, no report need
include separate financial statements for the Parent or Subsidiaries of the Parent or any disclosure with respect to
the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in this Offering
Memorandum.

In addition, for so long as any Notes are deemed to be “restricted securities” within the meaning of Rule 144,
unless the Parent is subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the US Exchange Act or exempt pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b)
thereunder, the Parent will furnish to the holders of Notes or holders of any beneficial interest therein and to
prospective purchasers of Notes or beneficial interests therein designated by any such holders, upon their request,
the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the US Securities Act.

Contemporaneously with the furnishing of each such report discussed above, the Parent will also (a) file a press
release with the appropriate internationally recognized wire services in connection with such report and (b) post
such report on the Parent’s website. In addition, so long as the Notes are admitted to the Official List and
admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange, each of the Parent and the Issuer will comply with the
publication and disclosure requirements (if any) of the United Kingdom Listing Authority and the London Stock
Exchange in relation to all such reports.

**Additional or Amended Intercreditor Agreement**

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the covenants contained therein, at the request of the Parent, at or prior
to any time that the Issuer or a Guarantor incurs or guarantees any Indebtedness permitted to be secured by a
Lien on the Collateral pursuant to the definition of Permitted Collateral Liens, the Issuer, the Guarantors, the
Security Agent and the Trustee shall either amend and/or restate the Intercreditor Agreement or enter into with
the creditors and/or agents of creditors with respect to such Indebtedness an intercreditor agreement on
substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or an amendment or restatement of the Intercreditor
Agreement in lieu thereof), in either such case, to permit such Indebtedness to be subject to (and benefit from)
substantially identical terms with respect to the release of the Collateral and Guarantees, enforcement of security
interests, turnover, limitations on enforcement and other rights and limitations of the creditors of Senior Secured
Debt as contained in the Intercreditor Agreement in effect as of the Issue Date (or, in the case of any such terms,
terms more favorable to the holders of the Notes). Only one such intercreditor agreement shall be outstanding at
any one time or, if more than one such intercreditor agreement is outstanding at any one time, the collective
terms of such intercreditor agreements must not conflict and must be no more disadvantageous to the holders of
the Notes than if all such Indebtedness was a party to one such agreement.

The Indenture will also provide that, at the direction of the Parent and without the consent of the holders of the
Notes, the Trustee will upon direction of the Parent from time to time enter into one or more amendments and/or
restatements of the Intercreditor Agreement or any such additional intercreditor agreement to: (1) cure any
ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein; (2) increase the amount of Indebtedness permitted to be
incurred or issued under the Indenture of the types covered thereby that may be incurred by the Issuer or any
Guarantors that is subject thereto (including the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness); (3) add
Guarantors thereto; (4) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes); or (5) make any other such change
thereto that does not adversely affect the rights of holders of the Notes in any material respect. The Parent will
not otherwise direct the Trustee to enter into any amendment and/or restatements of the Intercreditor Agreement
or, if applicable, any additional intercreditor agreement, without the consent of the holders of a majority in
principal amount of the outstanding Notes.

The Indenture will provide that each holder of a Note, by accepting a Note, will be deemed to have agreed to and
accepted the terms and condition of the Intercreditor Agreement or any amendment and/or restatement of the
Intercreditor Agreement or any additional intercreditor agreement contemplated hereby, and the entry into such
amendment and/or restatement of the Intercreditor Agreement or additional intercreditor agreement by the
Security Agent and the Trustee and the performance of their obligations and the exercise of their rights
thereunder and in connection therewith.

**Events of Default and Remedies**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default”:

(1) default for 30 days in the payment when due of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, with respect to the
Notes;

(2) default in the payment when due (at maturity, upon redemption or otherwise) of the principal of, or
premium, if any, on, the Notes;

(3) failure by the Parent or relevant Guarantor to comply with the provisions described under the caption
“—Certain Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets;

(4) failure by the Parent or relevant Guarantor for 60 days after written notice to the Parent by the Trustee or the
holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding voting as a single class
to comply with any of the agreements in the Indenture (other than a default in performance, or breach, or a
covenant or agreement which is specifically dealt with in clauses (1), (2) or (3) above), the Notes, the Note
Guarantee or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement entered into pursuant
to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or the Indenture);

(5) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there
may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Parent or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries)
(provided that, for the purpose of the following clause (a) only, such Indebtedness is Indebtedness incurred
by the Issuer or any Guarantor (other than a Guarantee of Indebtedness in which the borrower or issuer of
such Indebtedness is a Restricted Subsidiary of the Parent that is not a Guarantor or the Issuer)), whether
such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, if that default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on, such Indebtedness prior to
the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness on the date of such default;

(b) is caused by a failure to pay principal at final maturity on such Indebtedness prior to the expiration of
the grace period provided in such Indebtedness on the date of such default; or

(c) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its Stated Maturity,

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any
other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default as described in the preceding clauses
(a) or (b) or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates $40.0 million or more;

(6) failure by the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to pay final judgments entered by a court or courts
of competent jurisdiction aggregating in excess of $40.0 million, which judgments are not paid, discharged
or stayed for a period of 60 days;

(7) except as permitted by the Indenture, any Note Guarantee is held in any judicial proceeding to be
unenforceable or invalid or ceases for any reason to be in full force and effect, or any Guarantor, or any
Person acting on behalf of any Guarantor, denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Note Guarantee;

(8) (i) any security interest created by any Security Document ceases to be in full force and effect (except as
permitted by the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents) with
respect to any of the Collateral, or an assertion by the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that any of
the Collateral is not subject to a valid, perfected security interest (except as permitted by the terms of the
indenture or Security Documents); or (ii) the repudiation by the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
of any of its material obligations under any Security Document; and

(9) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency described in the Indenture with respect to the Parent or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of its Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken
together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary.

In the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, with respect to the
Parent, any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that,
taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable
immediately without further action or notice. If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee
or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare all the
Notes to be due and payable immediately.

Subject to certain limitations, holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes
may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from holders of the Notes

158


-----

notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest,
except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal, interest or Additional Amounts or
premium, if any.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, in case an Event of Default occurs
and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the
Indenture at the request or direction of any holders of Notes unless such holders have offered to the Trustee
reasonable indemnity or security against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive
payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest or Additional Amounts when due, no holder of a Note may
pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have requested the
Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such holders have offered the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer
of security or indemnity; and

(5) holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee
a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by notice to the Trustee
may, on behalf of the holders of all of the Notes, rescind an acceleration or waive any existing Default or Event
of Default and its consequences under the Indenture except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the
payment of interest, Additional Amounts or premium, if any, on, or the principal of, the Notes.

The Parent is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture.
Upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, the Parent is required to deliver to the Trustee a
statement specifying such Default or Event of Default.

**No Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Issuer or any Guarantor, as such, will have any
liability for any obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantors under the Notes, the Indenture, the Note Guarantees,
the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of,
such obligations or their creation. Each holder of Notes by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability.
The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. The waiver may not be effective to
waive liabilities under the federal securities laws.

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The Issuer may at any time, at the option of its Board of Directors evidenced by a resolution set forth in an
Officers’ Certificate, elect to have all of its obligations discharged with respect to the outstanding Notes and all
obligations of the Guarantors discharged with respect to their Note Guarantees (“Legal Defeasance”) except for:

(1) the rights of holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, or interest
(including Additional Amounts) or premium, if any, on, such Notes when such payments are due from the
trust referred to below;

(2) the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of Notes,
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and
money for security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’
obligations in connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of the Issuer and the
Guarantors released with respect to certain covenants (including its obligation to make Change of Control Offers)
that are described in the Indenture (“Covenant Defeasance”) and thereafter any omission to comply with those

159


-----

covenants will not constitute a Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes. In the event Covenant
Defeasance occurs, all Events of Default described under “—Events of Default and Remedies” (except those
relating to payments on the Notes or bankruptcy, receivership, rehabilitation or insolvency events) will no longer
constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(1) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, cash
in US dollars, non-callable US Government Securities, or a combination of cash in US dollars and
non-callable US Government Securities (in the case of the Dollar Notes), in amounts as will be sufficient, in
the opinion of a nationally recognized investment bank, appraisal firm or firm of independent public
accountants, to pay the principal of, or interest (including Additional Amounts and premium, if any) on the
outstanding Notes on the stated date for payment thereof or on the applicable redemption date, as the case
may be, and the Issuer must specify whether the Notes are being defeased to such stated date for payment or
to a particular redemption date;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee:

(a) an opinion of United States counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that (i) the Parent
has received from, or there has been published by, the US Internal Revenue Service a ruling or
(ii) since the Issue Date, there has been a change in the applicable US federal income tax law, in either
case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion of counsel will confirm that, the holders of the
outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for US federal income tax purposes as a
result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to tax on the same amounts, in the same manner
and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred; and

(b) an opinion of counsel in the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Issuer and reasonably acceptable to the
Trustee to the effect that the holders of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for tax
purposes of such jurisdiction as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to tax in
such jurisdiction on the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have
been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee:

(a) an opinion of United States counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that the holders of
the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for US federal income tax purposes as a
result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to US federal income tax on the same amounts,
in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance
had not occurred; and

(b) an opinion of counsel in the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Issuer and reasonably acceptable to the
Trustee to the effect that the holders of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for tax
purposes of such jurisdiction as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to tax in
such jurisdiction on the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have
been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred;

(4) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on the date of such deposit (other than a
Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to such deposit);

(5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a
default under, any material agreement or instrument (other than the Indenture and the agreements governing
any other Indebtedness being defeased, discharged or replaced) to which the Issuer or any of the Guarantors
is a party or by which the Issuer or any of the Guarantors is bound;

(6) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the
Issuer with the intent of preferring the holders of Notes over the other creditors of the Issuer with the intent
of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any creditors of the Issuer or others; and

(7) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that all
conditions precedent relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance have been complied with.

**Consent to Proposed Scheme**

The holders of the Notes and the Trustee are deemed to have irrevocably given their consent to the Capital
Reductions (in each case, without any liability to any person for so doing). To the extent that express consent to

160


-----

the Capital Reductions is required by the relevant court or otherwise, the holders of the Notes authorize and
direct the Trustee to give its consent (without any liability for so doing) to the Capital Reductions. Any cost,
expense or liability of the Trustee in giving its consent shall be for the account of the Parent.

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Except as provided in the next two succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Security Document may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the
holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including, without
limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes), and
any existing Default or Event of Default or compliance with any provision of the Indenture or the Notes or the
Note Guarantees may be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of
the then outstanding Notes (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or
tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes).

Unless consented to by the holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding
Notes (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or
exchange offer for, Notes), without the consent of each holder of Notes affected, an amendment, supplement or
waiver may not (with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting holder):

(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;

(2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any Note or alter the provisions with respect to the
redemption of the Notes (other than provisions relating to the covenants described above under the caption
“—Repurchase at the Option of Holders”);

(3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest, including default interest, on any Note;

(4) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, or interest, Additional Amounts or
premium, if any, on, the Notes (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the holders of at least a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes and a waiver of the Payment Default
that resulted from such acceleration);

(5) make any Note payable in currency other than that stated in the Notes;

(6) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights of
holders of Notes to receive payments of principal of, or interest, Additional Amounts or premium, if any,
on, the Notes;

(7) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note (other than a payment required by one of the
covenants described above under the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders”);

(8) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Note Guarantee or the Indenture, except in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement;

(9) release the Lien on Collateral granted for the benefit of the holders of Notes, except in accordance with the
terms of the relevant Security Document, the Indenture and Intercreditor Agreement; or

(10) make any change in the preceding amendment and waiver provisions.

Notwithstanding the preceding, without the consent of any holder of Notes, the Issuer, the Guarantors and the
Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Security Document:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes;

(3) to provide for the assumption of the Issuer’s or a Guarantor’s obligations to holders of Notes and Note
Guarantees in the case of a merger or consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the Issuer’s or such
Guarantor’s assets, as applicable;

(4) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the holders of Notes or that does
not adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any such holder;

161


-----

(5) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Notes, any Note Guarantee, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Security Document to any provision of this Description of Notes to the extent that such provision in this
Description of Notes was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Notes, the
Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents;

(6) to (a) enter into additional or supplemental Security Documents or (b) amend, restate and/or enter into an
intercreditor agreement as provided for under the caption “—Additional or Amended Intercreditor
Agreement”;

(7) to release Collateral in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the
Security Documents or to release any Note Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement;

(8) to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the limitations set forth in the Indenture
as of the Issue Date;

(9) to allow any Guarantor to execute a supplemental indenture and/or a Note Guarantee with respect to the
Notes;

(10) provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes (provided that the
uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code, or in a manner
such that the uncertificated Notes are described in Section 163(f)(2)(B) of the Code);

(11) to evidence and provide the acceptance of the appointment of a successor Trustee under the Indenture; or

(12) to add additional parties to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Security Document to the extent permitted
hereunder and thereunder.

The consent of the holders of Notes is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes issued thereunder, when:

(1) either:

(a) all Notes that have been authenticated, except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes that have been replaced or
paid and Notes for whose payment money has been deposited in trust and thereafter repaid to the
Issuer, have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

(b) all Notes that have not been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and payable by
reason of the mailing of a notice of redemption or otherwise or will become due and payable within
one year and the Issuer or any Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the
Trustee as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the holders, or cash in US dollars, non-callable
US Government Securities, or a combination of cash in US dollars and non-callable US Government
Securities, in amounts as will be sufficient, without consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to
pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Notes not delivered to the Trustee for cancellation for
principal, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, and accrued interest to the date of maturity or
redemption;

(2) in respect of clause 1(b), no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on the date of the
deposit (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to such
deposit and any similar deposit relating to other Indebtedness and, in each case, the granting of Liens to
secure such borrowings) and the deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default
under, any other instrument to which the Issuer or any Guarantor is a party or by which the Issuer or any
Guarantor is bound (other than with respect to the borrowing of funds to be applied concurrently to make
the deposit required to effect such satisfaction and discharge and any similar concurrent deposit relating to
other Indebtedness, and in each case the granting of Liens to secure such borrowings);

(3) the Issuer or any Guarantor has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it under the Indenture; and

(4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited
money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be.

In addition, the Issuer must deliver an Officers’ Certificate and an opinion of counsel to the Trustee stating that
all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied.

162


-----

**Judgment Currency**

Any payment on account of an amount that is payable in sterling or US dollars, as the case may be (the
“Required Currency”), which is made to or for the account of any holder of the Notes or the Trustee in lawful
currency of any other jurisdiction (the “Judgment Currency”), whether as a result of any judgment or order or the
enforcement thereof or the liquidation of the Issuer or a Guarantor, shall constitute a discharge of the Issuer or
the Guarantor’s obligation under the Indenture and the Notes or Note Guarantee, as the case may be, only to the
extent of the amount of the Required Currency with such holder or the Trustee, as the case may be, could
purchase in the London foreign exchange markets with the amount of the Judgment Currency in accordance with
normal banking procedures at the rate of exchange prevailing on the first Business Day following receipt of the
payment in the Judgment Currency. If the amount of the Required Currency that could be so purchased is less
than the amount of the Required Currency originally due to such holder or the Trustee, as the case may be, the
Issuer shall indemnify and hold harmless the holder or the Trustee, as the case may be, from and against all loss
or damage arising out of, or as a result of, such deficiency. This indemnity shall constitute an obligation separate
and independent from the other obligations contained in the Indenture or the Notes, shall give rise to a separate
and independent cause of action, shall apply irrespective of any indulgence granted by any holder or the Trustee
from time to time and shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any judgment or order for a
liquidated sum in respect of an amount due hereunder or under any judgment or order.

**Concerning the Trustee**

If the Trustee becomes a creditor of the Issuer or any Guarantor, the Indenture limits the right of the Trustee to
obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim
as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions; however, if it acquires any
conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days or resign as Trustee. If the Trustee becomes the
Holder, beneficial owner or pledgee of any Notes, it may deal with the Issuer with the same rights it would have
if it were not the Trustee, Paying Agent, Registrar or any other such agent.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes will have the right to
direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the
Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture provides that in case an Event of Default occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent man in
the conduct of his own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any
of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any holder of Notes, unless such holder has offered to
the Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. The Trustee undertakes
to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in the Indenture, the Notes, the Note
Guarantees and the Intercreditor Agreement and no implied covenants or obligations will be read into the
Indenture as against the Trustee.

**Listing**

Application has been made to the Financial Services Authority in its capacity as competent authority under the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 for the Notes to be admitted to the Official List of the United Kingdom
Listing Authority and to the London Stock Exchange for the Notes to be admitted to trading on the Professional
Securities Market of the London Stock Exchange. There can be no guarantee that the foregoing applications will
be approved as of the date the Notes are issued or at any time thereafter, and settlement of the Notes is not
conditioned on obtaining this listing.

**Additional Information**

Anyone who receives this Offering Memorandum in connection with this Offering of Notes may obtain a copy of
the Indenture, the form of Note, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement without charge by
writing to Sable International Finance Limited; c/o Cable and Wireless; 3rd Floor, 26 Red Lion Square; London
WC1R 4HQ England, Attention: Group Treasurer.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the London Stock Exchange and the rules of such exchange so require,
copies of the Indenture, the form of Note, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement may be
inspected and obtained from Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch at Winchester House, 1 Great Winchester
Street, London EC2N 2DB.

163


-----

Copies, current and future, of all of the Issuer’s annual audited consolidated and unconsolidated financial
statements and the Issuer’s unaudited consolidated interim semi-annual financial statements will, when
published, be available, during usual business hours on any weekday (Saturdays and public holidays excepted),
for inspection at the specified office of the Paying Agents.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer and each Guarantor will appoint CT Corporation System, 111 Eighth
Avenue, 13th Floor, New York, New York 10011 as its agent for service of process in any suit, action or
proceeding with respect to the Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees and for actions brought under US
federal or state securities laws brought in any Federal or state court located in the City of New York and will
submit to such jurisdiction.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Because the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors are outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the
United States against the Issuer or any Guarantor, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal,
premium, interest, Additional Amounts and any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the
Notes, may not be collectable within the United States.

**Certain Definitions**

under direct or indirect common control with such specified Person. For purposes of this definition, “control,” as
used with respect to any Person, means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the
direction of the management or policies of such Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by
agreement or otherwise; provided that beneficial ownership of 10% or more of the Voting Stock of a Person will
be deemed to be control. For purposes of this definition, the terms “controlling,” “controlled by” and “under

required interest payments due on the Note through, 2014 (excluding accrued but unpaid
interest to the redemption date), computed using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate as of such
redemption date plus 50 basis points; over

“Beneficial Owner” has the meaning assigned to such term in Rule 13d-3 and Rule 13d-5 under the Exchange
Act, except that in calculating the beneficial ownership of any particular “person” (as that term is used in
Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), such “person” will be deemed to have beneficial ownership of all
securities that such “person” has the right to acquire by conversion or exercise of other securities, whether such
right is currently exercisable or is exercisable only after the passage of time. The terms “Beneficially Owns” and
“Beneficially Owned” have a corresponding meaning.

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be
represented by a global note in registered form without interest coupons attached (the Regulation S Global
**Note).**

The Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers, pursuant to Rule 144A, will initially be
represented by a global note in registered form without interest coupons attached (the 144A Global Note and,
together with the Regulation S Global Note, the Global Notes). On the closing date the Global Notes will be
deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC.

Investors who are qualified institutional buyers and who purchase Notes in reliance on Rule 144A may hold their
interests in a Rule 144A Global Note directly through DTC if they are DTC participants, or indirectly through
organisations that are DTC participants. Investors who hold beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note
may hold such interests directly through Euroclear and Clearstream if they are participants in these systems, or
indirectly through organisations that are participants in Euroclear or Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will
hold interests in the Regulation S Global Note on behalf of their participants through their respective
depositaries, which in turn will hold the interests in the Regulation S Global Note in customers’ securities
accounts in the depositaries’ names on the books of DTC. Through and including the period ending 40 days after
the commencement of the offering of the Notes (the 40 Day Period), beneficial interests in the Regulation S
Global Note may only be held through Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg (as indirect participants in DTC).
Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in
book-entry form by DTC and its participants. The Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be issued only in
denominations of US$100,000 and integral multiples of US$1,000 in excess thereof.

The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, DTC will credit on its book-entry
registration and transfer systems a participant’s account with the interest beneficially owned by such a
participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain
purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations
may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global
form, owners of interest in the Global Notes will not have the Notes registered in their names, will not receive
physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or “holder” of
Notes under the Indenture for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, DTC (or its nominees) will be considered the holders of Global
Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. As such, participants must rely on the procedures of DTC and indirect
participants must rely on the procedures of DTC and the participants through which they own Book-Entry
Interests in order to exercise any rights of holders under the Indenture.

Neither the Issuer, nor the Trustee under the indenture governing the Notes, nor any of the Issuer’s respective
agents will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the indenture governing the Notes, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive
Notes in registered form (the Definitive Registered Notes):

    - if DTC notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depository and a successor
depository is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days;

    - if the Issuer, at its option, notifies the Trustee in writing that it elects to exchange in whole, but not in
part, the Global Note for Definitive Registered Notes; or

    - if DTC so requests following an event of default under the Indenture.

In such an event, the registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and issued
in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of DTC or the Issuer, as applicable (in accordance
with its customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial
ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend referred
to in “Notice to Investors,” unless that legend is not required by the indenture governing the Notes or applicable
law.

177


-----

**Redemption of Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the holders of
the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such
Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will
be equal to the amount received by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the
redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer understands that under existing practices of
DTC, and, as applicable, Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any
time, DTC, and, as applicable, Euroclear and Clearstream, will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a
proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and
appropriate; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than $100,000, as applicable, principal
amount at maturity, or less, may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

Payments of amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, interest, additional
interest and additional amounts) will be made by the Issuer to the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent will, in turn,
make such payments to DTC or its nominee, which will distribute such payments to participants in accordance
with their respective procedures.

Under the terms of the Indenture governing the Notes, the Issuer and the Trustee will treat the registered holder
of the Global Notes (i.e., the custodian for DTC or its nominee) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving
payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, neither the Issuer nor the Trustee or any of their respective
agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

    - any aspects of the records of DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest, for any such payments made by
DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining, supervising
or reviewing the records of DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest; or

    - payments made by DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for
maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or
indirect participant relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest; or

    - DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility of
such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers registered in “street
name”.

In order to tender Book-Entry interests in the change of control offer, the holder of the applicable Global Note
must, within the period specified in such offer, give notice of such tender to the principal paying agent and
specify the principal amount of book-entry interests to be tendered.

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global Notes
will be paid to holders of interest in such Notes through DTC in dollars.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

DTC has advised the Issuer that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of Notes (including the
presentation of Notes for exchange as described above) only at the direction of one or more participants to whose
account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the
aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction.
DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the
taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the Notes,
each of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive
Registered Notes in certificated form, and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to their respective
participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in DTC will be done in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in
immediately available funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason,

178


-----

including to sell the Notes to persons in jurisdictions which require physical delivery of such securities or to
pledge such securities, such holder must transfer its interest in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal
procedures of DTC and in accordance with the provisions of the indenture governing the Notes.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Notice to Investors”. Book-Entry Interests in the
Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed in “Notice to Investors”.

During the 40 Day Period, beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note may be transferred to a person who
takes delivery in the form of an interest in the Rule 144A Global Note only if such transfer is made pursuant to
Rule 144A and the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a certificate (in the form provided in the indenture
governing the Notes) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably
believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the
requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Notice to
_Investors” and in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the United States and other_
jurisdictions.

After the expiration of the 40-day Period, beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note may be transferred to
a person who takes delivery in the form of a beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Note without compliance
with these certification requirements.

Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in “Notice to Investors” Book-Entry Interests may be transferred and
exchanged as described under “Description of Notes—Transfer and Exchange”. Any Book-Entry Interest in one
of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in the
other Global Note of the same denomination will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the firstmentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note, and accordingly, will
thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
such other Global Note for as long as it retains such a Book-Entry Interest.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only as
described under “Description of Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only if the transferor first
delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer
will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Notice to Investors”.

Transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for 144A Book-Entry Interest will be
done by DTC by means of an instruction originating from the Trustee through the DTC Deposit/Withdrawal at
Custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made to
reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the relevant Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase
in the principal amount of the corresponding 144A Global Note. The policies and practices of DTC may prohibit
transfers of Unrestricted Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Note prior to the expiration of the 40
days after the date of initial issuance of the Notes. Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is
transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will,
upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first-mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry
interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any,
and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such
a Book-Entry Interest.

**Information Concerning DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the
convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that
settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers are responsible
for those operations or procedures. DTC has advised the Issuer that it is:

    - a limited purpose trust company organised under New York Banking Law;

    - a “banking organisation” under New York Banking Law;

    - a member of the Federal Reserve System;

    - a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code; and

    - a “clearing agency” registered under Section 17A of the Exchange Act.

179


-----

DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of
transactions among its participants. It does this through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of
securities participants, eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC participants
include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other
organisations. DTC’s owners are the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. the American Stock Exchange, Inc. and the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and a number of its direct participants. Others, such as banks,
brokers and dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct
participant, also have access to the DTC system and are known as indirect participants.

Like DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organisations. They also facilitate the
clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic bookentry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their
participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of
internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear
and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks,
trust companies and certain other organisations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to
others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship
with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because DTC can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain
banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not
participate in DTC or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite
certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of
securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be
limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through DTC will receive distributions attributable to the
144A Global Notes only through DTC participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange
and to trade in DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement System, and any permitted secondary market trading activity
in such Notes will, therefore be required by DTC to be settled in immediately available funds. You should be
aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other communications
involving Notes through DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg on days when those systems are open for
business. Those systems may not be open for business on days when banks, brokers and other institutions are
open for business in the United States.

In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be problems with completing transactions involving
DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg on the same business day as in the United States. U.S. investors
who wish to transfer their interests in the Notes, or to receive or make a payment or delivery of Notes, on a
particular day, may find that the transactions will not be performed until the next business day in Brussels or
Luxembourg, depending on whether Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg is used.

Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may
be, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be
discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, any Guarantor, the Trustee or the Paying Agent will
have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or
indirect participants, of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in dollars. Book-Entry Interests owned through DTC, accounts will
follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in registered form. Book-Entry Interests will
be credited to the securities custody accounts of DTC, holders on the Business Day following the settlement date
against payment for value on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of DTC and will settle in same-day funds. Since the
purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any Book-Entry
Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made
on the desired value date.

**TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

**CAYMAN ISLANDS TAXATION**

There is no income, corporate, capital gains or withholding tax imposed in the Cayman Islands. Stamp duty may
be payable in the Cayman Islands on a Note or some of the documents to be entered into in connection with the
transactions referred to in this offering memorandum if that Note or document is executed in the Cayman Islands
or, once executed, is brought into the Cayman Islands.

**UNITED KINGDOM TAXATION**

**The following applies only to persons who are the beneficial owners of Notes and is a summary of the**
**Issuer’s understanding of current law and practice in the United Kingdom relating to certain aspects of**
**United Kingdom taxation. Some aspects do not apply to certain classes of person (such as dealers and**
**persons connected with the Issuer) to whom special rules may apply. The United Kingdom tax treatment**
**of prospective noteholders depends on their individual circumstances and may be subject to change in the**
**future. Prospective noteholders who may be subject to tax in a jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom**
**or who may be unsure as to their tax position should seek their own professional advice.**

**Interest on the Notes**

**_Payment of interest on the Notes_**

Payments of interest on the Notes may be made without deduction of or withholding on account of United
Kingdom income tax provided that the Notes continue to be listed on a “recognised stock exchange” within the
meaning of section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (the Income Tax Act 2007). The London Stock Exchange
is a recognised stock exchange. Securities will be treated as listed on the London Stock Exchange if they are
included in the Official List (within the meaning of and in accordance with the provisions of Part 6 of the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) and admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange. Provided,
therefore, that the Notes remain so listed, interest on the Notes will be payable without withholding or deduction
on account of United Kingdom tax.

Interest on the Notes may also be paid without withholding or deduction on account of United Kingdom tax
where interest on the Notes is paid by a company and, at the time the payment is made, the Issuer reasonably
believes (and any person by or through whom interest on the Notes is paid reasonably believes) that the
beneficial owner is within the charge to United Kingdom corporation tax as regards the payment of interest,
provided that HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has not given a direction (in circumstances where it has
reasonable grounds to believe that it is likely that the above exemption is not available in respect of such
payment of interest at the time the payment is made) that the interest should be paid under deduction of tax.

If, in such circumstances, the beneficial owner is not within the charge to United Kingdom corporation tax as
regards the payment of interest, the right to pay without deduction is treated as having never applied to any such
payment.

In other cases, an amount must generally be withheld from payments of interest on the Notes on account of
United Kingdom income tax at the basic rate (currently 20%). However, where an applicable double tax treaty
provides for a lower rate of withholding tax (or for no tax to be withheld) in relation to a noteholder, HMRC can
issue a notice to the Issuer to pay interest to the noteholder without deduction of tax (or for interest to be paid
with tax deducted at the rate provided for in the relevant double tax treaty).

Noteholders may wish to note that, in certain circumstances, HMRC has power to obtain information (including
the name and address of the beneficial owner of the interest) from any person in the United Kingdom who either
pays or credits interest to or receives interest for the benefit of a noteholder or, in the case of Notes that are
issued at a discount, who either pays amounts payable on the redemption of Notes to or receives such amounts
for the benefit of another person, although HMRC published practice indicates that HMRC will not exercise the
power referred to above to require this information in respect of such amounts payable on redemption of Notes
where such amounts are paid on or before 5 April 2010. Information so obtained may, in certain circumstances,
be exchanged by HMRC with the tax authorities of the jurisdiction in which the Noteholder is resident for tax
purposes.

**_Payments by a Guarantor_**

If a Guarantor makes any payments in respect of interest on Notes (or other amounts due under the Notes other
than the repayment of amounts subscribed for such Notes) such payments may be subject to United Kingdom

181


-----

withholding tax at 20% subject to such relief as may be available under the provisions of any applicable double
taxation treaty or any other exemption which may apply. It is not certain that such payments by the Guarantor
will be eligible for all the exemptions described above.

**_EU Savings Directive_**

Under EC Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income (the Taxation of Savings Income
**Directive), Member States are required to provide to the tax authorities of another Member State details of**
payments of interest (or similar income) paid by a person within its jurisdiction to an individual resident in that
other Member State or to certain limited types of entities established in that other Member State. However, for a
transitional period, Belgium, Luxembourg and Austria are instead required (unless during that period they elect
otherwise) to operate a withholding system in relation to such payments (the ending of such transitional period
being dependent upon the conclusion of certain other agreements relating to information exchange with certain
other countries). Belgium has elected to replace this withholding tax system with a regime of exchange of
information to the Member State of residence with effect from 1 January 2010. A number of non-EU countries
and territories, including Switzerland, have adopted similar measures (a withholding system, in the case of
Switzerland).

On 15 September 2008 the European Commission issued a report to the Council of the European Union on the
operation of the Taxation of Savings Income Directive, which included the Commission’s advice on the need for
changes to the Taxation of Savings Income Directive. On 13 November 2008 the European Commission
published a more detailed proposal for amendments to the Taxation of Savings Income Directive, which included
a number of suggested changes. The European Parliament approved an amended version of this proposal on
24 April 2009. If any of the proposed changes are made in relation to the Taxation of Savings Income Directive,
they may amend or broaden the scope of the requirements described above.

**_Further United Kingdom Income Tax Issues_**

Interest on the Notes constitutes United Kingdom source income for tax purposes and, as such, may be subject to
income tax by direct assessment even where paid without withholding.

However, interest with a United Kingdom source received without deduction or withholding on account of
United Kingdom tax will not be chargeable to United Kingdom tax in the hands of a noteholder (other than
certain trustees) who is not resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom unless that noteholder carries on a
trade, profession or vocation in the United Kingdom through a United Kingdom branch or agency in connection
with which the interest is received or to which the Notes are attributable (and where that noteholder is a
company, unless that noteholder carries on a trade in the United Kingdom through a permanent establishment in
connection with which the interest is received or to which the Notes are attributable). There are exemptions for
interest received by certain categories of agent (such as some brokers and investment managers). The provisions
of an applicable double taxation treaty may also be relevant for such noteholders.

**United Kingdom Corporation Tax Payers**

In general, noteholders which are within the charge to United Kingdom corporation tax will be charged to tax as
income on all returns, profits or gains on, and fluctuations in value of, the Notes (whether attributable to currency
fluctuations or otherwise) broadly in accordance with their statutory accounting treatment.

**Other United Kingdom Tax Payers**

**_Taxation of Chargeable Gains_**

A disposal of Notes by an individual noteholder who is resident or ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom or
who carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the United Kingdom through a branch or agency to which the
Notes are attributable, may give rise to a chargeable gain or allowable loss for the purposes of the United
Kingdom taxation of chargeable gains.

**_Taxation of discount_**

Notwithstanding the paragraph entitled “Taxation of Chargeable Gains” above, if the Notes constitute “deeply
discounted securities” for the purposes of Chapter 8 of Part 4 of the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act
2005 then any gain realised on redemption or transfer of the Notes by a noteholder who is within the charge to

182


-----

United Kingdom income tax in respect of the Notes will generally be taxable as income but such noteholder will
not be able to claim relief from income tax in respect of costs incurred on the acquisition, transfer or redemption,
or losses incurred on the transfer or redemption, of the Notes. The Notes would generally be treated as deeply
discounted securities for these purposes if, as at the Issue Date, the amount payable on maturity or other occasion
of redemption, other than an Optional Redemption or Redemption for Changes in Tax, (“A”) exceeds, or may
exceed, the issue price of the Notes by more than A x 0.5% x Y, where Y is the number of years between the
Issue Date and redemption.

**_Accrued Income Scheme_**

On a disposal of Notes by a noteholder, any interest which has accrued since the last interest payment date may
be chargeable to tax as income under the rules of the accrued income scheme as set out in Part 12 of the Income
Tax Act 2007, if that noteholder is resident or ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom or carries on a trade in
the United Kingdom through a branch or agency to which the Notes are attributable. The accrued income scheme
will not apply if the Notes are deeply discounted securities for the purposes of Chapter 8 of Part 4 of the Income
Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005, as to which see the paragraph entitled “—Taxation of discount”
above.

**Stamp Duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax**

No United Kingdom stamp duty or Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (SDRT) is payable on issue or transfer of the Notes.

**US TAXATION**

**TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) CIRCULAR 230, EACH**
**TAXPAYER IS HEREBY NOTIFIED THAT: (A) ANY TAX DISCUSSION HEREIN IS NOT**
**INTENDED OR WRITTEN TO BE USED, AND CANNOT BE USED BY THE TAXPAYER FOR THE**
**PURPOSE OF AVOIDING US FEDERAL INCOME TAX PENALTIES THAT MAY BE IMPOSED ON**
**THE TAXPAYER; (B) ANY SUCH TAX DISCUSSION WAS WRITTEN TO SUPPORT THE**
**PROMOTION OR MARKETING OF THE TRANSACTIONS OR MATTERS ADDRESSED HEREIN;**
**AND (C) THE TAXPAYER SHOULD SEEK ADVICE BASED ON THE TAXPAYER’S PARTICULAR**
**CIRCUMSTANCES FROM AN INDEPENDENT TAX ADVISER.**

The following is a summary of certain US federal income tax considerations relevant to US Holders and Non-US
Holders (each as defined below) acquiring, holding and disposing of Notes. This summary is based on the US
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code), final, temporary and proposed US Treasury regulations,
administrative and judicial interpretations, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect.
This summary does not discuss all aspects of US federal income taxation that may be relevant to investors in
light of their particular circumstances, such as investors subject to special tax rules (including, without limitation:
(i) financial institutions; (ii) insurance companies; (iii) dealers or traders in stocks, securities, or currencies or
notional principal contracts; (iv) regulated investment companies; (v) real estate investment trusts;
(vi) tax-exempt organisations; (vii) partnerships, pass-through entities, or persons that hold Notes through passthrough entities; (viii) investors that hold Notes as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion, constructive sale or other
integrated transaction for US federal income tax purposes; (ix) investors that have a functional currency other
than the US dollar and (x) US expatriates and former long-term residents of the United States), all of whom may
be subject to tax rules that differ significantly from those summarised below. This summary does not address US
federal estate, gift or alternative minimum tax considerations, or non-US, state or local tax considerations and
does not address the US federal income tax treatment of holders that do not acquire the Notes as part of the initial
distribution at their issue price (generally, the first price to the public at which a substantial amount of Notes is
sold for money). This summary assumes that investors will hold their Notes as capital assets for US tax purposes
(generally, property held for investment).

For the purposes of this summary, a US Holder is a beneficial owner of Notes that is for US federal income tax
purposes (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation created in, or
organised under the laws of, the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate the
income of which is capable of being included in gross income for US federal income tax purposes regardless of
its source or (iv) a trust the administration of which is subject to the primary supervision of a US court and which
has one or more United States persons who have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust. A
**Non-US Holder is a beneficial owner of Notes that is not a US Holder.**

183


-----

If any entity treated as a partnership for US federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the tax treatment of a
partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership.
A holder that is a partnership, and partners in such partnerships, should consult their tax advisors regarding the
tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes.

**US Holders**

**_Payments of Interest_**

Stated interest on a note, including the payment of any Additional Amounts other than interest on a “Discount
Note” that is not “qualified stated interest” (each as defined below under “Original Issue Discount—General”),
will be taxable to a US Holder as ordinary income at the time it is received or accrued, in accordance with the
holder’s method of accounting for tax purposes.

Stated interest on the Notes and original issue discount (as discussed below), if any, accrued with respect to the
Notes will generally constitute income from sources outside the United States, subject to the rules regarding the
US foreign tax credit allowable to a US Holder (and the limitations imposed thereon).

Should any tax be withheld, the amount withheld and the gross amount of any additional amounts paid to a US
Holder will be included in such holder’s income at the time such amount is received or accrued in accordance
with such holder’s method of tax accounting. Withholding tax, if any, imposed on a US Holder should, subject to
limitations and conditions and at the election of such holder, be treated as foreign income tax eligible for credit
against such holder’s US federal income tax liability or a deduction in computing taxable income, to the extent
such tax is not otherwise refundable. Any Additional Amounts would generally constitute income from sources
outside the United States.

In certain circumstances (see “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption”), the Issuer may be obligated to
pay amounts in excess of stated interest or principal on the Notes. According to US Treasury regulations, the
possibility that any such payments in excess of stated interest or principal will be made will not affect the amount
of interest income a US Holder recognises if there is only a remote chance as of the date the Notes were issued
that such payments will be made. The Issuer believes that the likelihood that it will be obligated to make any
such payments is remote. Therefore, the Issuer does not intend to treat the potential payment of these amounts as
part of the yield to maturity of the Notes. The Issuer’s determination that these contingencies are remote is
binding on a US Holder unless such holder discloses its contrary position in the manner required by applicable
US Treasury regulations. The Issuer’s determination is not, however, binding on the IRS, and, if the IRS were to
challenge this determination, a US Holder might be required to accrue income on its Notes in excess of stated
interest, and to treat as ordinary income rather than capital gain any income realised on the taxable disposition of
a note before the resolution of the contingencies. In the event a contingency occurs, it would affect the amount
and timing of the income recognised by a US Holder. If any such amounts are in fact paid, US Holders will be
required to recognise such amounts as income.

In addition, under certain other circumstances the Issuer may be obligated to pay a premium upon the repurchase
of the Notes due to a Change of Control. The Issuer believes that it is significantly more likely than not that it
will not have to pay a premium upon a Change of Control. Therefore, this possibility will be ignored for purposes
of determining the yield and maturity of the Notes.

**_Original Issue Discount_**

**General**

A Note will be treated as issued with OID (a Discount Note) if the excess of the Note’s “stated redemption price
at maturity” over its issue price is more than a de minimis amount (0.25% of the Note’s stated redemption price
at maturity multiplied by the number of complete years to its maturity). Generally, the “issue price” of a Note
under the applicable Final Terms will be the first price at which a substantial amount of such Notes included in
the issue of which the Note is a part is sold to persons other than Note houses, brokers, or similar persons or
organisations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents, or wholesalers. The “stated redemption
**price at maturity” of a Note is the total of all payments provided by the Note that are not payments of “qualified**
stated interest”. A “qualified stated interest” payment is generally any one of a series of stated interest
payments on a Note that are unconditionally payable at least annually at a single fixed rate (with certain
exceptions for lower rates paid during some periods), or certain variable rates, applied to the outstanding
principal amount of the Note. If a Note has de minimis OID, a US Holder must include the de minimis amount in

184


-----

income as stated principal payments are made on the Note, unless the holder makes the election described below
under “—Election to Treat All Interest as Original Issue Discount”. A US Holder can determine the includible
amount with respect to each such payment by multiplying the total amount of the Note’s de minimis OID by a
fraction equal to the amount of the principal payment made divided by the stated principal amount of the Note.

US Holders of Discount Notes must include OID in income calculated on a constant-yield method before the
receipt of cash attributable to the income, and will generally have to include in income increasingly greater
amounts of OID over the life of the Discount Notes. The amount of OID includible in income by a US Holder of
a Discount Note is the sum of the daily portions of OID with respect to the Discount Note for each day during the
taxable year or portion of the taxable year on which the US Holder holds the Discount Note (accrued OID). The
daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID
allocable to that accrual period. Accrual periods with respect to a Note may be of any length selected by the US
Holder and may vary in length over the term of the Discount Note as long as (i) no accrual period is longer than
one year and (ii) each scheduled payment of interest or principal on the Note occurs on either the final or first
day of an accrual period. The amount of OID allocable to an accrual period equals the excess of (a) the product
of the Discount Note’s adjusted issue price at the beginning of the accrual period and the Discount Note’s yield
to maturity (determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for
the length of the accrual period) over (b) the sum of the payments of qualified stated interest on the Discount
Note allocable to the accrual period. The “adjusted issue price” of a Discount Note at the beginning of any
accrual period is the issue price of the Note increased by (x) the amount of accrued OID for each prior accrual
period and decreased by (y) the amount of any payments previously made on the Note that were not qualified
stated interest payments.

**Election to Treat All Interest as Original Issue Discount**

A US Holder may elect to include in gross income all interest that accrues on a Note using the constant-yield
method described above under “Original Issue Discount—General” with certain modifications. For purposes of
this election, interest includes stated interest, OID, de minimis OID, market discount, de minimis market discount
and unstated interest, as adjusted by any acquisition premium. If a US Holder makes this election for the Note,
then, when the constant-yield method is applied, the issue price of the Note will equal its cost, the issue date of
the Note will be the date of acquisition, and no payments on the Note will be treated as payments of qualified
stated interest. This election will generally apply only to the Note with respect to which it is made and may not
be revoked without the consent of the IRS. If the election to apply the constant-yield method to all interest on a
Note is made with respect to a Note with market discount, the electing US Holder will be treated as having made
an election to include market discount in income currently over the life of all debt instruments with market
discount held or thereafter acquired by the US Holder. US Holders should consult their tax advisers concerning
the propriety and consequences of this election.

**_Sale, Exchange and Redemption of Notes_**

Generally, upon the sale, exchange or redemption of a note, a US Holder will recognise taxable gain or loss equal
to the difference between the amount realised on the sale, exchange, or redemption (less any amount attributable
to accrued but unpaid interest which, if it has not previously been included in income, will be taxable as such)
and such US Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the note. A US Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a note will generally
equal the cost of such note to such US Holder increased by the amount of any OID or market discount included
in the US Holder’s income with respect to the Note and the amount, if any, of income attributable to de minimis
OID and de minimis market discount included in the US Holder’s income with respect to the Note, and reduced
by the amount of any payments that are not qualified stated interest payments. Except to the extent attributable to
accrued but unpaid interest, such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital
gain or loss if at the time of sale, exchange or redemption the note has been held by such US Holder for more
than one year, and will generally be treated as from US sources for purposes of the US foreign tax credit
limitation. In the case of a US Holder that is an individual, estate or trust, the maximum marginal federal income
tax rate applicable to capital gains is currently lower than the maximum marginal rate applicable to ordinary
income if the Notes are held for more than one year. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to significant
limitations.

**Non-US Holders**

Subject to the discussion concerning information reporting and backup withholding below, a Non-US Holder
generally should not be subject to US federal income or withholding tax on any payments on the Notes and gain

185


-----

from the sale, redemption or other disposition of the Notes unless: (i) that payment and/or gain is effectively
connected with the conduct by that Non-US Holder of a trade or business in the US; (ii) in the case of any gain
realised on the sale or exchange of a note by an individual Non-US Holder, that Holder is present in the US for
183 days or more in the taxable year of the sale, exchange or retirement and certain other conditions are met; or
(iii) the Non-US Holder is subject to tax pursuant to provisions of the Code applicable to certain expatriates.

**Information Reporting and Backup Withholding**

In general, payments of principal, interest and OID on, and the proceeds of a sale, redemption or other
disposition of, the Notes, payable to a US Holder by a US paying agent or other US intermediary will be reported
to the IRS and to the US Holder as may be required under applicable regulations. Backup withholding will apply
to these payments if the US Holder fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number or certification of
exempt status or otherwise to comply with the applicable backup withholding requirements. Certain US Holders
(including, among others, corporations) are not subject to backup withholding.

In general, payments of principal, interest and accrued OID on, and the proceeds of a sale, redemption or other
disposition of, the Notes, payable to a Non-US Holder by a US paying agent or other US intermediary will not be
subject to backup withholding tax and information reporting requirements if appropriate certification (IRS Form
W-8BEN or other appropriate form) is timely provided by the Non-US Holder to the payer and the payer does
not have actual knowledge that the certificate is false.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

The Issuer has agreed to sell to Barclays Bank PLC, BNP Paribas, J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd., RBS Securities
Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Limited, HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. and Lloyds TSB Bank plc as the Initial
Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have severally, but not jointly, agreed to purchase from the Issuer, the
entire principal amount of the Notes. The sale will be made pursuant to a purchase agreement among the Issuer,
the Guarantors and the Initial Purchasers dated February 2010 (the Purchase Agreement). The
obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to purchase Notes
from the Issuer, are several and not joint. The Purchase Agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers will
purchase all the Notes if any of them are purchased.

The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the issue price that appears on the cover of
this offering memorandum. After the initial offering, the Initial Purchasers may change the offering price and any
other selling terms. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell Notes through certain of their affiliates. Sales in the
United States will be made through registered US broker-dealer affiliates of the Initial Purchasers. Lloyds TSB
Bank plc is not a U.S. registered broker-dealer and, therefore, to the extent that they intend to effect any sales of
the Notes in the United States, they will do so through one or more US registered broker-dealers as permitted by
the regulations of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other
charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price set
forth on the cover page hereof.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of
the Notes are subject to certain conditions precedent. The Purchase Agreement provides that the Issuer and each
Guarantor will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities
under the Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in
respect thereof.

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be
offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account of, US persons, except to qualified institutional
buyers in reliance on Rule 144A and to certain persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S.
Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are
restricted as described under “Notice to Investors”.

Each Initial Purchaser, severally and not jointly, represents, warrants and agrees that it:

    - has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of
section 21 of FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances
in which section 21(1) of FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or the Guarantors; and

    - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of FSMA with respect to anything done by
it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by the Issuer
or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or
distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to the Issuer or the Notes in any
jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly
or indirectly, and neither this offering memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in
connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in
compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This offering
memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where
such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum comes
are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the offering of the Notes, the
distribution of this offering memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Notice to Investors”.

The Issuer and the Guarantors have also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or
otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge,
contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act or the safe
harbour of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes.

187


-----

The Issuer and the Guarantors will not (i) until 30 days after 2 February 2010, syndicate or announce any
intention to syndicate any bank loan or other debt facility by any current or future obligor under the New Credit
Facilities or any other Cable & Wireless Communications Group subsidiary, except for the New Credit Facilities,
and (ii) until 60 days after 2 February 2010, offer, sell or issue, or announce an intention to offer, sell or issue, by
way of a public or private offering or placement, (a) any debt securities or discount debt securities of any current
or future obligor under the New Credit Facilities and (b) any debt securities or discount debt securities of any
other Cable & Wireless Communications Group subsidiary, provided that, in the case of each of (i) and (ii)(b)
only, such action would in the opinion of the Initial Purchasers also materially prejudice the execution of the
offering of the Notes or the formation of orderly trading or price development after the Issue Date.

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. Application has been made to the
UK Listing Authority for the Notes to be admitted to the Official List of the UK Listing Authority and to the
London Stock Exchange for the Notes to be admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange’s regulated
market. However, the Issuer cannot assure you that the Notes will be approved for listing or that such listing will
be maintained.

The Initial Purchasers have advised the Issuer that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by
applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any marketmaking activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In
addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act. Accordingly, the Issuer cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will
be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will
be favourable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks relating to the Notes—There may not be on active trading market
_for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited”._

In connection with the offering, The Royal Bank of Scotland plc as, the Stabilising Manager, or persons acting on
its behalf, may engage in transactions that stabilise, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes.
Specifically, the Stabilising Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in the open
markets to stabilise the price of the Notes. The Stabilising Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may also
over allot the offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open
market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilising Manager, or persons acting on its behalf,
may bid for and purchase Notes in market making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations
and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilise or maintain the respective market price of the Notes
above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilising Manager is not required to engage in these
activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurances can be given as to the liquidity of,
or trading markets for, the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks relating to the Notes—There may not be on active
_trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited”._

Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial
Purchaser. Stabilising transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilising
bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchase of the Notes in the open market
after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial
Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker
or dealer are purchased in a stabilising or covering transaction to cover short positions.

These stabilising transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to be
higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions, if commenced, may be
discontinued at any time.

The Initial Purchasers have, directly and indirectly through affiliates, provided investment and commercial
banking, financial advisory and other services to Cable and Wireless plc and the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group, for which they have received customary compensation. In particular, the Initial
Purchasers or certain of their affiliates are lenders under the New Credit Facilities and, in each case, they have
received customary fees and reimbursement of certain expenses in connection with the New Credit Facilities.
Barclays Bank PLC, BNP Paribas, J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd. and RBS Securities Inc. or certain of their
affiliates are also lenders under the Cable & Wireless Communications Bridge Facility and have received
customary fees and reimbursement of certain expenses in connection therewith. The Cable & Wireless
Communications Group intends to use a portion of the proceeds of the offering to repay certain amounts
outstanding under the New Credit Facilities. The Cable & Wireless Communications Bridge Facility, which is
undrawn, will be cancelled at the completion of the offering of the Notes. See “Use of Proceeds”.

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of any of the
Notes offered hereby.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, or any state securities laws, and,
unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not
subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. Accordingly,
the Notes offered hereby are being offered and sold only to qualified institutional buyers (as defined in
Rule 144A) in reliance on Rule 144A and in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S.

The Issuer has not registered and will not register the Notes under the Securities Act and, therefore, the Notes
may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, US persons except
pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities
Act. Accordingly, the Issuer is offering and selling the Notes to the Initial Purchasers for re-offer and resale only:

    - in the United States to “qualified institutional buyers,” commonly referred to as “QIBs” as defined in
Rule 144A in compliance with Rule 144A; and

    - outside the United States to non-US persons in accordance with Regulation S.

This offering document uses the terms “offshore transaction”, “US person” and “United States” with the
meanings given to them in Regulation S.

Each purchaser of Notes, by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented to and
agreed with the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers as follows:

(1) You understand and acknowledge that the Notes and the guarantees have not been registered under the
Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws and that the Notes are being offered for resale in
transactions not requiring registration under the Securities Act or any other securities laws, including sales
pursuant to Rule 144A, and, unless so registered, may not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred except in
compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws,
pursuant to an exemption therefrom or in any transaction not subject thereto and in each case in compliance
with the conditions for transfer set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5) below.

(2) You are not an “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144A) of the Issuer or acting on the Issuer’s behalf, and you
are either:

(a) a QIB, within the meaning of Rule 144A and are aware that any sale of these Notes to you will be made
in reliance on Rule 144A, and such acquisition will be for your own account or for the account of
another QIB; or

(b) you are purchasing the Notes in an offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S.

(3) You acknowledge that none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, or the Initial Purchasers, nor any person
representing any of them, has made any representation to you with respect to the Issuer or the offer or sale
of any of the Notes, other than the information contained in this offering memorandum, which offering
memorandum has been delivered to you and upon which you are relying in making your investment
decision with respect to the Notes. You acknowledge that neither the Initial Purchasers nor any person
representing the Initial Purchasers make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness
of this offering memorandum. You have had access to such financial and other information concerning the
Issuer and the Notes as you have deemed necessary in connection with your decision to purchase any of the
Notes, including an opportunity to ask questions of, and request information from, the Issuer and the Initial
Purchasers.

(4) You are purchasing the Notes for your own account, or for one or more investor accounts for which you are
acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in
connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act or any state securities laws,
subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of your property or the property of such investor
account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and subject to your or their ability to resell such
Notes pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or any other exemption from registration available under the
Securities Act.

189


-----

(5) You agree on your own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which you are purchasing the
Notes, and each subsequent holder of the Notes by its acceptance thereof will be deemed to agree, to offer,
sell or otherwise transfer such Notes prior to the date (the Resale Restriction Termination Date) that is
one year (in the case of Rule 144A Notes) or 40 days (in the case of Regulation S Notes) after the later of
the date of the original issue and the last date on which the Issuer or any of its affiliates was the owner of
such Notes (or any predecessor thereto) only (i) to the Issuer, (ii) pursuant to a registration statement that
has been declared effective under the Securities Act, (iii) for so long as the Notes are eligible pursuant to
Rule 144A to a person you reasonably believe is a QIB that purchases for its own account or for the account
of a QIB to whom notice is given that the transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A (iv) pursuant to
offers and sales that occur outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S or (v) pursuant to any
other available exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, subject in each of the
foregoing cases to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the property of such investor
account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and to compliance with any applicable state
securities laws, and any applicable local laws and regulations, and further subject to the Issuer’s and the
trustee’s rights prior to any such offer, sale or transfer (I) pursuant to clauses (iv) and (v) to require the
delivery of an opinion of counsel, certification and/or other information satisfactory to each of them and (II)
in each of the foregoing cases, to require that a certificate of transfer in the form appearing on the reverse of
the security is completed and delivered by the transferor to the Trustee. The foregoing restrictions on resale
will not apply subsequent to the Resale Restriction Termination Date.

Each purchaser acknowledges that each note will contain a legend substantially to the following effect:

THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN AND WILL NOT BE REGISTERED UNDER THE US SECURITIES
ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “US SECURITIES ACT) OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY
STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION. NEITHER THIS SECURITY NOR ANY INTEREST OR
PARTICIPATION HEREIN MAY BE OFFERED, SOLD, ASSIGNED, TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED,
ENCUMBERED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION OR
UNLESS SUCH TRANSACTION IS EXEMPT FROM, OR NOT SUBJECT TO, THE REGISTRATION
REQUIREMENTS OF THE US SECURITIES ACT.

THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY BY ITS ACCEPTANCE HEREOF AGREES TO OFFER, SELL OR
OTHERWISE TRANSFER SUCH SECURITY, PRIOR TO THE DATE (THE “RESALE RESTRICTION
TERMINATION DATE”) WHICH IS [IN THE CASE OF RULE 144A NOTES: ONE YEAR] [IN THE
CASE OF REGULATION S NOTES: 40 DAYS] AFTER THE LATER OF THE ORIGINAL ISSUE
DATE HEREOF AND THE LAST DATE ON WHICH THE ISSUER OR ANY AFFILIATE OF THE
ISSUER WAS THE OWNER OF THIS SECURITY (OR ANY PREDECESSOR OF THIS SECURITY)
ONLY (A) TO THE ISSUER, THE GUARANTORS OR ANY SUBSIDIARY THEREOF,
(B) PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION STATEMENT WHICH HAS BEEN DECLARED EFFECTIVE
UNDER THE US SECURITIES ACT, (C) FOR SO LONG AS THE SECURITIES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR
RESALE PURSUANT TO RULE 144A UNDER THE US SECURITIES ACT (“RULE 144A”), TO A
PERSON IT REASONABLY BELIEVES IS A “QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER” AS DEFINED
IN RULE 144A THAT PURCHASES FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT OR FOR THE ACCOUNT OF A
QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER TO WHOM NOTICE IS GIVEN THAT THE TRANSFER IS
BEING MADE IN RELIANCE ON RULE 144A, (D) PURSUANT TO OFFERS AND SALES THAT
OCCUR OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATION S UNDER THE
US SECURITIES ACT OR (E) PURSUANT TO ANY OTHER AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM THE
REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE US SECURITIES ACT, SUBJECT IN EACH OF THE
FOREGOING CASES TO ANY REQUIREMENT OF LAW THAT THE DISPOSITION OF ITS
PROPERTY OR THE PROPERTY OF SUCH INVESTOR ACCOUNT OR ACCOUNTS BE AT ALL
TIMES WITHIN ITS OR THEIR CONTROL AND TO COMPLIANCE WITH ANY APPLICABLE
STATE SECURITIES LAWS, AND ANY APPLICABLE LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND
FURTHER SUBJECT TO THE ISSUER’S AND THE TRUSTEE’S RIGHTS PRIOR TO ANY SUCH
OFFER, SALE OR TRANSFER (I) PURSUANT TO CLAUSE (E) TO REQUIRE THE DELIVERY OF
AN OPINION OF COUNSEL, CERTIFICATION AND/OR OTHER INFORMATION SATISFACTORY
TO EACH OF THEM, (II) IN EACH OF THE FOREGOING CASES, TO REQUIRE THAT A
CERTIFICATE OF TRANSFER IN THE FORM APPEARING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS
SECURITY IS COMPLETED AND DELIVERED BY THE TRANSFEROR TO THE TRUSTEE AND
(III) AGREES THAT IT WILL GIVE TO EACH PERSON TO WHOM THIS SECURITY IS
TRANSFERRED A NOTICE SUBSTANTIALLY TO THE EFFECT OF THIS LEGEND.

If you purchase Notes, you will also be deemed to acknowledge that the foregoing restrictions apply to
holders of beneficial interests in these Notes as well as to holders of these Notes.

190


-----

(6) You agree that you will give to each person to whom you transfer the Notes notice of any restrictions on the
transfer of such Notes.

(7) You acknowledge that until 40 days after the commencement of the offering, any offer or sale of the Notes
within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the
registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance
with Rule 144A.

(8) You acknowledge that the trustee will not be required to accept for registration or transfer any Notes
acquired by you except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to the Issuer and the trustee that the
restrictions set forth therein have been complied with.

(9) You acknowledge that the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of
your acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements and agrees that if any of the
acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements deemed to have been made by your
purchase of the Notes are no longer accurate, it shall promptly notify the Initial Purchasers. If you are
acquiring any Notes as a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, you represent that you have
sole investment discretion with respect to each such investor account and that you have full power to make
the foregoing acknowledgements, representations and agreements on behalf of each such investor account.

(10) You understand that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the United States) by the Issuer
or the Initial Purchasers that would result in a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or
distribution of this offering memorandum or any other Senior Secured material relating to the Issuer or the
Notes in any jurisdiction where action for such purpose is required. Consequently, any transfer of the Notes
will be subject to the selling restrictions set forth under “Plan of Distribution”.

**ERISA Considerations**

The US Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), imposes requirements on
employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) subject to ERISA and on entities, such as
collective investment funds and separate accounts whose underlying assets include the assets of such plans (all of
which are hereinafter referred to as ERISA Plans), and on persons who are fiduciaries (as defined in
Section 3(21) of ERISA) with respect to such ERISA Plans. The Code also imposes certain requirements on
ERISA Plans and on other retirement plans and arrangements, including individual retirement accounts and
Keogh plans (such ERISA Plans and other “plans” as defined in Section 4975 of the Code are hereinafter referred
to as Plans). Certain employee benefit plans, including governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of
ERISA), if no election has been made under Section 410(d) of the Code, church plans (as defined in
Section 3(33) of ERISA), and non-US plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) are not subject to the
prohibited transaction rules of ERISA or the Code but may be subject to similar rules under other applicable laws
or documents. Accordingly, assets of such plans may be invested in the Notes without regard to the prohibited
transaction considerations under ERISA and the Code described below, subject to the provisions of other
applicable federal, state, local or non-US law (Similar Law).

Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA’s general fiduciary requirements, including the requirement of
investment prudence and diversification, requirements respecting delegation of investment authority and the
requirement that an ERISA Plan’s investments be made in accordance with the documents governing the ERISA
Plan. Each ERISA Plan fiduciary, before deciding to invest in the Notes, must be satisfied that investment in the
Notes is a prudent investment for the ERISA Plan, that the investments of the ERISA Plan, including the
investment in the Notes, are diversified so as to minimize the risk of large losses and that an investment in the
Notes complies with the ERISA Plan and related trust documents.

Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code prohibits Plans from engaging in certain transactions
with persons that are “parties in interest” under ERISA or “disqualified persons” under the Code with respect to
such Plans (collectively, Parties in Interest). The types of transactions between Plans and Parties in Interest that
are prohibited include, without limitation: (a) sales, exchanges or leases of property, (b) loans or other extensions
of credit and (c) the furnishing of goods and services. Certain Parties in Interest that participate in a non-exempt
prohibited transaction may be subject to an excise tax under ERISA or the Code. In addition, the persons
involved in the prohibited transaction may have to rescind the transaction and pay an amount to the Plan for any
losses realised by the Plan or profits realised by such persons and certain other liabilities could result that have a
significant adverse effect on such persons. Certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction provisions of
Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code may apply depending in part on the type of Plan fiduciary
making the decision to acquire a Note and the circumstances under which such decision is made. Included among

191


-----

these exemptions are Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA (relating to certain transactions between a plan and a
non-fiduciary service provider), Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption (PTCE) 95-60 (relating to investments
by insurance company general accounts), PTCE 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment
funds), PTCE 84-14 (relating to transactions effected by a “qualified professional asset manager”), PTCE 90-1
(relating to investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts) and PTCE 96-23 (relating to
transactions determined by an in-house asset manager). There can be no assurance that any of these exemptions
or any other exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the Notes.

Any insurance company proposing to invest assets of its general account in the Notes of the Issuer should
consider the extent to which such investment would be subject to the requirements of ERISA in light of the US
Supreme Court’s decision in John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Harris Trust and Savings Bank,
510 US 86 (1993). In particular, such an insurance company should consider the extent of the relief granted by
the US Department of Labor in PTCE 95-60, and the effect of Section 401(c) of ERISA as interpreted by the
regulations issued thereunder by the US Department of Labor in January 2000. There can be no assurance that
any of the exceptions to the look-through rule applies or that PTCE 95-60 will be available.

Under a “look-through rule” set forth in regulations issued by the US Department of Labor at 29 C.F.R.
Section 2510.3-101, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA (Plan Assets Regulation), if a Plan invests in an
“equity interest” of an entity that is neither a “publicly-offered security” nor a security issued by an investment
company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Plan’s assets include both the equity interest
and an undivided interest in each of the entity’s underlying assets, unless it is established that the entity is an
“operating company” or that equity participation in the entity by “benefit plan investors” is not “significant”. The
Plan Assets Regulation defines equity participation in an entity by “benefit plan investors” as “significant” if
25% or more of the value of any class of equity interest in the entity is held by “benefit plan investors”. Benefit
**Plan Investors include any (i) employee benefit plan as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, that is subject to Title**
I of ERISA, (ii) plan described in Section 4975 of the Code, that is subject to Section 4975 of the Code, including
without limitation, an individual retirement account or Keogh plan or (iii) entity whose underlying assets include
assets of a plan described in (i) or (ii) by reason of a plan’s investment in such entity, including but not limited to,
as applicable, an insurance company general account, an insurance company separate account or a collective
investment fund.

If the assets of the Issuer were deemed to be plan assets of a Plan, the Issuer would be subject to certain fiduciary
obligations under ERISA and certain transactions that the Issuer might enter into, or may have entered into, in the
ordinary course of business might constitute or result in non-exempt prohibited transactions under ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code and might have to be rescinded.

The Issuer believes that the Notes issued by it should not be considered to be “equity interests” for purposes of
the Plan Assets Regulation and will be treated as indebtedness. Nevertheless, prohibited transactions within the
meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code may arise if any of the Notes are acquired by a
Benefit Plan Investor with respect to which the Issuer is a Party in Interest. Accordingly, each purchaser and
subsequent transferee of any Note (or any interest therein) will be deemed by such purchase or acquisition of any
Note (or any interest therein) to have represented and warranted, on each day from the date on which the
purchaser or transferee acquires the Note (or any interest therein) through and including the date on which the
purchaser or transferee disposes of such Note (or any interest therein), that either (i) it is not, is not using the
assets of and shall not at any time hold such Note (or any interest therein) for or on behalf of a Benefit Plan
Investor or a governmental, church or non-US plan or (ii) its acquisition, holding and disposition of such Note (or
any interest therein) will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or, in the case of a governmental, church or non-US plan, a violation of any
applicable Similar Laws.

Any Plan fiduciary that proposes to cause a Plan to purchase any Notes (or any interest therein) should consult
with its counsel regarding the applicability of the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of
ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code to such an investment, and to confirm that such investment will not
constitute or result in a prohibited transaction or any other violation of an applicable requirement of ERISA or
the Code. Similarly, fiduciaries of any governmental, church or non-US plans should consult with their counsel
before purchasing any of the Notes (or any interest therein).

Any purchaser, including, without limitation, any fiduciary purchasing on behalf of (i) a Plan, (ii) a Benefit Plan
Investor, or (iii) a governmental, church or non-US plan which is subject to the fiduciary responsibility or

192


-----

prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA or the provisions of Section 4975 of the Code or Similar Law,
transferee, or holder of the Notes (or any interest therein) will be deemed to have represented, in its corporate and
fiduciary capacity, that:

(a) With respect to the acquisition, holding and disposition of Notes, (or any interest therein), (1) either (A) it is
not, and it is not acting on behalf of (and for so long as it holds such Notes or any interest therein will not
be, and will not be acting on behalf of), a Plan, a Benefit Plan Investor, or a governmental, church or
non-US plan which is subject to Similar Laws, and no part of the assets used or to be used by it to acquire or
hold such Notes (or any interest therein) constitutes the assets of any such Plan, Benefit Plan Investor or
governmental, church or non-US plan which is subject to Similar Laws, or (B)(i) its acquisition, holding and
disposition of such Notes (or any interest therein) does not and will not constitute or otherwise result in a
non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code (or, in the
case of a governmental, church or non-US plan, a non-exempt violation of any Similar Law); and (ii) none
of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, Trustee or any of their respective affiliates, is a sponsor
of, or a fiduciary (within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA or, with respect to a governmental, church
or non-US plan, any definition of “fiduciary” under Similar Law) with respect to, the acquirer, transferee or
holder in connection with any acquisition or holding of such Notes (or any interest therein), or as a result of
any exercise by the Issuer or any of its affiliates of any rights in connection with such Notes (or any interest
therein), and no advice provided by the Issuer or any of their affiliates has formed a primary basis for any
investment or other decision by or on behalf of the acquirer or holder in connection with such Notes (or any
interest therein) and the transactions contemplated with respect to such Notes (or any interest therein); and
(2) it will not sell or otherwise transfer such Notes (or any interest therein) otherwise than to a purchaser or
transferee that is deemed (or if required by the applicable indenture, certified) to make these same
representations, warranties and agreements with respect to its acquisition, holding and disposition of such
Notes (or any interest therein).

(b) The purchaser (or, as applicable, any transferee) and any fiduciary causing it to purchase any Notes (or any
interest therein) agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the
Trustee, and their respective affiliates, from and against any cost, damage or loss incurred by any of them as
a result of any of the foregoing representations and agreements being or becoming false.

(c) Any purported purchase or transfer of any Note (or any interest therein) to a purchaser or transferee that
does not comply with the requirements of the above provisions shall be null and void ab initio.

**ENFORCEABILITY OF JUDGEMENTS**

The United States and the Cayman Islands do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. The Cayman Islands are a party to the United Nations
Convention on the Recognition of Foreign Arbitral Awards (the New York Convention) and Courts of the
Cayman Islands will generally recognise and enforce arbitral awards made pursuant to an agreement to arbitrate
in a jurisdiction which is party to the New York Convention. Any judgment rendered by any federal or state court
in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities law,
would not be directly enforceable in the Cayman Islands. In order to enforce any such judgment in the Cayman
Islands, proceedings must be initiated by way of civil law action on the judgment debt before a court of
competent jurisdiction in the Cayman Islands. In this type of action, a Cayman Islands court generally will not
(subject to the matters identified below) reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court.

A Cayman Islands court will generally give judgment only if the following conditions are satisfied:

    - the relevant U.S. court had jurisdiction (under the rules of private international law in the Cayman
Islands) to give the judgment; and

    - the judgment is final and conclusive on the merits and is for a definite sum of money (not being a sum
payable in respect of taxes or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or other penalty or
otherwise based on a penal, revenue or other public law of the United States).

A court in the Cayman Islands will also refuse to enforce such a judgment if it is established that:

    - the enforcement of such judgment would contravene public policy or statute in the Cayman Islands;

    - the enforcement of the judgment is prohibited by statute;

    - the proceedings in the Cayman Islands were not commenced with the relevant limitation period;

    - before the date on which the U.S. court gave judgment, the issues in question had been the subject of a
final judgment of a court in the Cayman Islands or of a court of another jurisdiction whose judgment is
enforceable in the Cayman Islands;

    - the judgment has been obtained by fraud or in proceedings in which the principles of natural justice
were breached; or

    - the bringing of proceedings in the relevant U.S. court was contrary to an agreement under which the
dispute in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in that court (to whose jurisdiction
the judgment debtor did not submit).

If a court in the Cayman Islands gives judgment for the sum payable under a U.S. judgment, the Cayman Islands
judgment would be enforceable by the methods generally available for this purpose. In addition, it may not be
possible to obtain a judgment in the Cayman Islands or to enforce that judgment if the judgment debtor is subject
to any insolvency or similar proceedings, or if the judgment debtor has any set-off or counterclaim against the
judgment creditor.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce judgments in the Cayman Islands in civil and
commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts in the manner described above using the methods
available for enforcement of a judgment of a court in the Cayman Islands.

publicised on its ITU ICT eye website at http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ICTEYE/Default.aspx; in this case, the
relevant Communications Group Company is determined to be the market leader where its number of
subscribers (based on the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s internal records) exceeds 50% of the
total number of subscribers in the market as recorded on the ITU ICT eye website;

(b) where the ITU ICT eye website does not provide categorical evidence of the relevant Communications
Group Company being a market leader (for example, in relation to mobile markets in Panama and the
broadband market in Barbados), market share analysis prepared for the 2009 calendar year by Business
Monitor International; in this case, the relevant Communications Group Company is determined to be the

205


-----

market leader if the Business Monitor International report concludes that such Communications Group
Company is the market leader or ascribes to such Communications Group Company, the greatest market
shares;

(c) in respect of Afghanistan, due to more than two decades of war and the resulting impact on, among other
things, infrastructure, technology and human resources, few statistics about the Afghan mobile
telecommunications market are available and, to the extent such statistics are available, it is difficult to
ascertain their accuracy. Because the ITU does not report a total subscriber number of Afghan mobile
telecommunications customers, the designation of Roshan, a joint venture of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group, as the market leader in the Afghan mobile market, is based on Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s own internal market research and data;

(d) in respect of Macau, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group calculates its Macau mobile and
broadband market shares by dividing its total number of customers for Macau mobile or broadband services,
as the case may be, (based on its own internal records) by the total customer numbers used for the Macau
mobile or broadband market, as the case may be, which were publicly reported to DSEC (the statistics and
census service for the Macau SAR government) http://www.dsec.gov.mo/Statistic.aspx;

(e) in respect of each of Montserrat, the Falkland Islands and Diego Garcia, the local Cable & Wireless
Communications Group subsidiary has been designated the market leader of Montserrat, the Falkland

provider of broadband services in such jurisdiction, subject, in the case of Montserrat, to a liberalisation
process in that jurisdiction, which began in 2009;

(f) in respect of each of Antigua, Guernsey and Fiji, based on its internal market research and data, LIME has
the largest Antigua broadband market share, Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s Fiji subsidiary has
the largest Fiji broadband market share and Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s Guernsey
subsidiary has the largest Guernsey broadband market share; however, two other companies compete in the
Antigua broadband market and other companies compete in each of the Fiji and Guernsey broadband
markets and it is mathematically possible for one of these companies to have a market share equal to or
exceeding that of LIME, Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s Fiji subsidiary or Cable & Wireless
Communication Group’s Guernsey subsidiary, as the case may be; and

(g) in respect of BVI, no data on the BVI broadband market is available through ITU or Business Monitor
International; therefore, LIME has been designated as the BVI broadband market leader based on Cable &
Wireless Communication Group’s internal market research and data.

As explained in note 2.1, certain administrative costs, interest, tax and pension amounts of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group reflect the management and capital structure of the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group prior to Demerger. Accordingly these amounts, together with the respective earnings per share figures,
may not be comparable with actual amounts that would have occurred had the Demerger been in effect during the
periods presented.

**CABLE & WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS GROUP**
**NOTES TO THE HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

**1.** **General information**

Cable & Wireless Communications Group is an international telecommunications group offering mobile,
broadband and domestic and international fixed line services to residential and business customers in 38
countries. It has four major operations being the Caribbean, Panama, Macau and Monaco & Islands.

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies**

2.1 Basis of preparation

The historical financial information represents the financial record for the three years ended 31 March 2009
of those businesses that will be held by the Cable & Wireless Communications Group at the date of
admission of the shares of Cable & Wireless Communications to the London Stock Exchange. Following
the Demerger, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group will comprise Cable & Wireless
Communications and the entities forming the Cable & Wireless Group other than those entities comprising
the demerged Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group. The principal entities, including associated undertakings
and joint ventures, included within the historical financial information are set out in note 42.

The financial record is based on historical financial information extracted from the consolidation schedules
which supported the audited financial statements of the Cable & Wireless Group for the three years ended
31 March 2009.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group has not in the past formed a separate legal group and
therefore it is not meaningful to show share capital or an analysis of historical reserves for the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group. The net assets of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group are
represented by the cumulative investment in the Cable & Wireless Communications Group companies
(shown as “invested capital”).

_Application of IFRS_

The historical financial information has been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European
Union except as described below. The historical financial information has also been prepared in accordance
with applicable listing rules and requirements of the Prospectus Directive (including the regulation
regarding issuers with complex financial histories).

IFRS does not provide for the preparation of extracted historical financial information. Accordingly, the
historical financial information in this document has been prepared using certain commonly used accounting
conventions (as described in the Annexure to SIR 2000 (Investment Reporting Standard applicable to public
reporting engagements on historical financial information) issued by the UK Auditing Practices Board). The
application of these conventions results in the following material departures from IFRS as adopted by the
European Union. In all other aspects, IFRS as adopted by the European Union have been applied.

_Carved out and combined financial information_

The historical financial information combines only the financial information for those businesses that
will be held by the Cable & Wireless Communications Group and therefore excludes financial
information for those subsidiaries of the Cable & Wireless Group that will form the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group. Such excluded Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group subsidiaries, were, however,
subsidiaries of entities within the Cable & Wireless Communications Group during the three years
ended 31 March 2009. Such an approach differs from the consolidation requirements of IAS 27
_Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements which requires consolidation of all subsidiaries._

_Non-trading balances with the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group_

On Demerger, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group will not be required to repay non-trading
balances with the Cable & Wireless Communications Group. For this reason, these amounts have been
deducted from the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s invested capital, rather than being
treated as assets as required by IFRS.

F-8


-----

_Earnings per share_

The weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding used to calculate earnings per share is
based on the number of shares expected on listing of Cable & Wireless Communications. The shares
expected on listing of Cable & Wireless Communications will be equal to the outstanding shares of
Cable and Wireless plc prior to the Scheme of Arrangement. Therefore, these shares are considered to
be the most appropriate denominator on which to compute earnings per share for the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group.

As a result of the above matters, no statement of compliance with IFRS can be included in respect of the
historical financial information.

_Other principles applied_

In addition, the following principles have been applied in preparing the historical financial information.

 - There has been no allocation of the corporate head office costs of the Cable & Wireless Group to the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group. This is because any allocation would be arbitrary in nature and
may not reflect properly the costs relating to functions such as financial reporting and treasury and
board costs as would have been incurred by that business. Therefore, the costs of the corporate head
office in Cable & Wireless Communications Group represent 100% of the corporate head office costs
of the Cable & Wireless Group. These costs are not representative of the level of historical head office
costs of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business or of the costs that may be required
in the future.

 - The historical financial information is presented in US dollars (US$) and rounded to the nearest
million. Historically, the financial information in respect of those businesses included within the
historical accounts of Cable and Wireless plc was presented in pounds sterling (£) as this was the
dominant functional currency of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group entities when the Cable
& Wireless Communications Group included other Cable & Wireless Group companies. However, as a
result of the Demerger of those entities, the dominant functional currency of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group entities has been determined to be US dollars as this is the primary currency in
which the exchange transactions of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group are priced.
Accordingly, the historical financial information has been presented as though US dollars was the
presentation currency throughout the period. The key exchange rates between sterling and US dollars in
the periods presented were:


**Year**

**31 March**
**2007**

- Trading balances with the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group are presented within receivables and
payables as though they were with an external party.

- The main UK defined benefit scheme operated by the Cable & Wireless Group provides benefits to
current and past employees of, and therefore represents obligations of, both the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group. For the period since 1 April
2006, the two Groups have each borne a proportion of the service costs of this scheme based on the
approximate split of active membership. The scheme’s expected return on assets and interest expense
have been apportioned between the two Groups based on the directors’ assumptions about the
underlying liabilities, being 20% Cable & Wireless Communications Group and 80% Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group. The assets, liabilities, actuarial gains and losses and cash flows relating to the
scheme have been apportioned based on 20% Cable & Wireless Communications Group and 80%
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group.

Detailed disclosures relating to this scheme are provided in note 32.

On Demerger and as agreed with the scheme trustees, the liabilities of the main UK defined benefit
pension scheme operated by the Cable & Wireless Group will be allocated approximately equally
between the Cable & Wireless Communications Group and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group.

F-9


-----

Management believes presenting the historical financial information according to the historical
allocation better represents the underlying pension cost of the two Groups over the periods presented.

If the historical financial information (which has been prepared on the basis of a split of 20% Cable &
Wireless Communications Group and 80% Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group) had been prepared on
the basis of the approximate actual split of liabilities to be applied post-Demerger (i.e. a split of 50%
Cable & Wireless Communications Group and 50% Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group), the impact
on the relevant financial statements of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group would have been
as follows:

**Year ended 31 March**

**2007** **2008** **2009**

**US$m** **US$m** **US$m**
Impact on the statement of financial performance (increase in profit) . . . . . . . . . 8 11 6
Impact on the statement of comprehensive income (increase/(decrease) in
comprehensive income) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 65 546 (464)

assets) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25 — (14)
Impact on the statement of cash flows (decrease in cash) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (6) (15) (9)

    - Tax charges in the historical financial information have been determined based on the tax charges
recorded by the Cable & Wireless Communications Group companies in their local statutory accounts
as well as certain adjustments relating to those entities made for Cable & Wireless Group consolidation
purposes. The tax charges recorded in the historical income statement have been affected by the tax
arrangements within the Cable & Wireless Group and are not necessarily representative of the tax
charges that would have been reported had the Cable & Wireless Communications Group been an
independent group. They are not necessarily representative of the historical tax charges attributable to
the Cable & Wireless Communications Group or tax charges that may arise in the future.

This historical financial information has been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain
financial instruments held at fair value. Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale are stated at the
lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. The preparation of the historical financial
information in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions
that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. These
estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are
considered to be reasonable under the circumstances. They form the basis of judgements about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual outcomes may differ
from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on a continuing basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
Critical judgements and areas where the use of estimates is significant are discussed in note 3.

The accounting policies used in the historical financial information have been applied consistently by Cable
& Wireless Communications Group entities.

2.2 Application of recently issued International Financial Reporting Standards

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group has considered the implications, of the upcoming
amendments to IFRS, issued up to 30 September 2009, in the historical financial information.

The amendment clarifies how existing hedge accounting
principles should be applied to the designation of a one-sided risk
in a hedged item and to inflation in a hedged item. This
amendment will not have a material impact on the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group.

The main changes in the revised IFRS 3 include the separate
accounting of acquisition related costs, changes to business
combinations achieved in stages and changes to the accounting for
business combinations where less than 100% of the equity is
acquired. These changes will be effective for businesses purchased
by the Cable & Wireless Communications Group after 31 March
2010. As such, no assessment can be determined of their impact.

The revisions to IAS 27 specify that changes in a parent’s
ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in the loss of
control must be accounted for as equity transactions. This
amendment is consistent with current Cable & Wireless
Communications Group policy.

These amendments allow the reassessment of embedded
derivatives on reclassification of financial instruments out
of the fair value through the income statement category.
The amendments will not have a material impact on the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group.

This interpretation applies to non-cash dividends
excluding those controlled by the same party before and
after the transaction. It clarifies the recognition and
measurement of non-cash dividends payable. This
interpretation does not affect the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group.


On or after 1 July The IFRIC clarifies how existing IFRSs are applied to
2009. agreements in which an entity receives an asset from a
customer which it then uses to connect the customer to a
network to provide ongoing access to goods or services.
The Cable & Wireless Communications Group is currently
considering the implications of this interpretation.


This amendment contains further disclosure requirements
to enhance the information available to investors about
fair value measurement and liquidity risk associated with
an entity’s financial instruments. This is a disclosure
standard only and will not have a material impact on the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group.

The Improvements to IFRS contains miscellaneous
necessary but non-urgent amendments to IFRSs. These
improvements will not have a material impact on the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group.

These amendments clarify the scope of IFRS 2 and its
interaction with other standards. They also address how
an entity should account for some share-based payments
in its own financial statements if its parent or another
entity in the Cable & Wireless Communications Group
will pay for goods or services that it has received. These
amendments will not have a material impact on the Cable
& Wireless Communications Group.

2.3 Basis of consolidation

The historical financial information has been prepared on the basis that the companies that will form the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group were a group for consolidation purposes during the periods
covered by the financial information and includes the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s share of
the results and net assets of its joint ventures and associates. The accounts of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s main trading subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates have been prepared to
align with the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s reporting date.

(a) _Subsidiaries_

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by and forming part of the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group. Control exists when the Cable & Wireless Communications Group has the power to govern the
financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing
control, the existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable are considered.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which the Cable & Wireless Communications Group
effectively takes control until the date that control ceases. Accounting policies of subsidiaries are
aligned with the policies adopted by the Cable & Wireless Communications Group to ensure
consistency.

The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, liabilities incurred or
assumed and equity instruments issued at the date of exchange plus costs directly attributable to the
acquisition. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s share of the identifiable net assets and contingent liabilities acquired is
recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the
subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.

Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Cable & Wireless
Communications Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the
transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.

(b) _Joint ventures and associates_

Investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting
and are initially recognised at cost. Joint ventures are entities over which the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group exercises joint control. Associates are entities over which the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group has significant influence but not control over the financial and
operating policies. This generally accompanies a shareholding of between 20% and 50%. The Cable &
Wireless Communications Group’s investment in joint ventures and associates includes goodwill (net
of any accumulated impairment loss) identified on acquisition. Accounting policies of joint ventures
and associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by
the Cable & Wireless Communications Group.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s share of its joint ventures’ and associates’ postacquisition profits or losses is recognised in the income statement. Its share of post-acquisition
movements in reserves is recognised in invested capital. The cumulative post-acquisition movements
are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment.

When the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s share of losses in a joint venture or associate
exceeds its investment (including any other unsecured long-term receivables), the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group does not recognise further losses unless it has incurred obligations or made
payments on behalf of the investee.

Unrealised gains on transactions between the Cable & Wireless Communications Group and its joint
ventures and associates are eliminated to the extent of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s
investment.

2.4 Segmental reporting

Cable & Wireless Communications Group is an international telecommunications service provider. It
operates integrated telecommunications companies in 38 countries offering mobile, broadband and domestic
and international fixed line services to residential and business customers. It has four principal operations
being the Caribbean, Panama, Macau and Monaco & Islands.

F-12


-----

IFRS 8 Segmental Reporting requires disclosures in respect of the operating segments of the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group according to the ‘management approach’. This approach reflects the type
and extent of information presented to the chief operating decision-maker of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group (the Cable & Wireless Communications Group Board).

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group Board considers the performance of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s four principal operations in the Caribbean, Panama, Macau and Monaco &
Islands in assessing the performance of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group and making decisions
about the allocation of resources. Accordingly, these are the operating segments disclosed. The operating
segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group Board.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group also operates the Central operations, a small central function
which acts as a portfolio manager and operational support provider. This operational support includes risk
management, best practice sharing, facilitating the development and enhancement of Customer Relationship
Management strategies and billing systems, as well as provision of specialist procurement, networks,
technology, legal, finance, tax, communications and human resources services. The Central operations are
not considered to be an operating segment as it does not earn revenue from its activities. The results of the
Central operations are reported in the other and eliminations column.

2.5 Foreign currency translation

(a) _Functional currency_

Items included in the financial statements of each of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s
entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity
operates (the functional currency).

(b) _Foreign currency translation_

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency of each entity using the
exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting
from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.

(c) _Foreign operations_

The results and financial position of all the Cable & Wireless Communications Group entities that have
a functional currency different from the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s presentation
currency of US dollars are translated as follows:

(i) assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the reporting date;

(ii) income and expenses are translated at rates closely approximating the rate at the date of the
transactions; and

(iii) resulting exchange differences are recognised in invested capital.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets
and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.

On disposal of a foreign entity, accumulated exchange differences are recognised in the income
statement in the same period in which the gain or loss on disposal is recognised.

Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities are taken to
invested capital. Where investments are matched in whole or in part by foreign currency loans, the
exchange differences arising on the retranslation of such loans are also recorded as movements in the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s invested capital.

There are no Cable & Wireless Communications Group entities operating in a hyperinflationary
economy.

2.6 Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment
losses. The cost of property, plant and equipment includes labour and overhead costs arising directly from
the construction or acquisition of an item of property, plant and equipment.

F-13


-----

The estimated costs of dismantling and removing an asset and restoring the site on which it is located are
included in the cost of property, plant and equipment. The corresponding obligation is recognised as a
provision in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.

Subsequent costs are included in an asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other
subsequent costs (primarily repairs and maintenance) are charged to the income statement during the
financial period in which they are incurred.

Interest costs relating to borrowings made to finance separately identifiable major capital projects (those that
take six months or more to complete) are capitalised as part of the cost of assets when it is probable that
they will result in future economic benefits to the entity and the costs can be measured reliably. Any interest
costs included are only those that are incurred up to the time that those projects are ready for service.

Depreciation is not recognised on freehold land or assets under construction. On other property, plant and
equipment, depreciation is recognised on the difference between the cost of an item and its estimated
residual value, on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

**Lives**

Cables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . up to 20 years
Network equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 to 25 years
Ducting . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 40 years
Freehold buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 40 years
Leasehold buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . up to 40 years or term of lease if less

Asset residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date. An
asset’s carrying amount is written down to its recoverable amount if the carrying amount is greater than its
recoverable amount through sale or use.

Gains and losses on the sale of property, plant and equipment are determined by reference to the proceeds
and net book values. These gains and losses are recognised in the income statement.

Engineering spares held for use by the Cable & Wireless Communications Group over a period exceeding
one year are included in assets under construction. They are stated at cost and include an appropriate
allocation of labour and overheads. The cost is determined on a weighted average basis. Provision is made
for deterioration and obsolescence.

2.7 Intangible assets

(a) _Goodwill_

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s share of the identifiable net assets and contingent liabilities of the acquired
subsidiary, joint venture or associate. It is not amortised. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is
included in intangible assets. Goodwill on acquisitions of joint ventures and associates is included in
the carrying value of those investments. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost
less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of
impairment testing.

(b) _Other intangible assets_

Costs that are directly associated with the purchase and implementation of identifiable and unique
software products by the Cable & Wireless Communications Group are recognised as intangible assets.
Expenditures that enhance and extend the benefits of computer software programs beyond their original
specifications and lives are recognised as a capital improvement and added to the original cost of the
software.

Expenditure is only capitalised if costs can be measured reliably, the product is technically and
commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable and the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group has sufficient resources to complete development and to use the asset.

Intangible assets relating to licences and customer contracts have been obtained as part of the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group’s business combinations. They are recorded initially at their fair
values at the date of acquisition.

Other intangible assets are amortised over their respective lives which are usually based on contractual
terms.

Other intangible assets are stated at cost less amortisation on a straight-line basis over the following
periods:

2.8 Financial assets and liabilities

_Financial assets_

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories:
financial assets at fair value through the income statement, receivables, held-to-maturity investments and
available-for-sale financial assets. The classification depends on the purpose for which the assets are held.
The Cable & Wireless Communications Group currently does not classify any assets as held-to-maturity
investments. The basis of determining fair values is set out in note 2.9.

Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition in accordance with IAS
39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and re-evaluates this designation at every
reporting date for financial assets other than those held at fair value through the income statement.

_Financial assets at fair value through the income statement_

This category has two sub-categories: financial assets held for trading and those designated at fair value
through the income statement at inception. A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired
principally for the purpose of selling in the short-term or if so designated by management. Derivatives are
also categorised as held for trading. Assets classified as financial assets at fair value through the income
statement are presented as current assets if they are either held for trading or are expected to be realised
within one year of the reporting date.

_Available-for-sale financial assets_

Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated in this
category at inception or not classified in any of the other categories. They are included in non-current assets
unless management intends to dispose of the asset within 12 months of the reporting date. Purchases and
sales of assets are recognised on the trade-date (the date on which the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group commits to purchase or sell the asset).

_Receivables_

Receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in
an active market. They arise when the Cable & Wireless Communications Group provides money, goods or
services directly to a third-party with no intention of trading the receivable. Receivables are included in
current assets, except for those with maturities greater than one year after the reporting date (where they are
classified as non-current assets). Receivables are included in trade and other receivables in the statement of
financial position.

Receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. Amortised
cost is determined using the effective interest method less an allowance for impairment if necessary. An
allowance for impairment of receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms
of the receivables. The amount of the allowance is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and
the present value of estimated future cash flows (discounted at the effective interest rate). The allowance is
initially recognised in the income statement.

_Recognition and measurement_

Financial assets at fair value through the income statement are recognised and subsequently carried at fair
value. Available-for-sale financial assets are recognised and subsequently carried at fair value plus any

F-15


-----

directly attributable transaction costs. Receivables and held-to-maturity investments are carried at amortised
cost using the effective interest method. Financial assets not carried at fair value through the income
statement are initially recognised at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs.

Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the assets have expired or have
been transferred and the Cable & Wireless Communications Group has transferred substantially all risks and
rewards of ownership. Gains and losses (both realised and unrealised) arising from changes in the value of
financial assets held at fair value through the income statement are included in the income statement in the
period in which they arise.

Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of non-monetary securities classified as
available-for-sale are recognised in invested capital. When securities classified as available-for-sale are sold
or impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments are included in the income statement.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective
evidence that a financial asset or a Cable & Wireless Communications Group of financial assets is impaired.
In the case of equity securities classified as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair
value of the security below its cost is considered in determining whether it is impaired. If any such evidence
exists for available-for-sale financial assets the cumulative loss is removed from invested capital and
recognised in the income statement. This loss is measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and
the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the income
statement. Impairment losses recognised on these instruments are not reversed through the income statement
if the fair value of the security increases in a later period.

_Derivative financial instruments_

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are
subsequently re-measured at their fair value at each reporting date. The method of recognising the resulting
gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of
the item being hedged. Gains and losses on derivative instruments that are not designated as hedge
instruments are recognised immediately in the income statement.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group only hedges net investments in foreign operations. The
Cable & Wireless Communications Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship
between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for
undertaking various hedge transactions. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group also documents its
assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in
hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values of cash flows of hedged items.

Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges by
recognising any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge in
equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income
statement.

_Financial liabilities_

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group classifies its financial liabilities into the following
categories: loans and puttable instruments. The classification depends on the terms of the liability, as
described below.

Management determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition in accordance with
IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and re-evaluates this designation at every
reporting date.

_Loans_

Loans are recognised initially at fair value net of directly attributable transaction costs incurred. Loans are
subsequently measured at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and
the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the loans using the effective
interest method.

Convertible bonds issued by the Cable & Wireless Communications Group were initially recognised at fair
value. The bond was separated into liability and equity components. The liability component was recognised
at amortised cost. The equity component represented the residual of the fair value of the bond less the
liability component. The liability component was subsequently measured on an amortised cost basis.

F-16


-----

Loans are classified as current liabilities unless the Cable & Wireless Communications Group has an
unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date (where
they are classified as non-current assets).

_Puttable instruments_

Puttable instruments on non-controlling interests issued as part of a business combination are accounted for
by the Cable & Wireless Communications Group as a financial liability. The liability is based on the present
value of the redemption amount as if the puttable instrument had been exercised at the reporting date.
Movements in the value of the liability together with dividends paid to minority interests are recognised as
adjustments to goodwill with the unwind of the discount on the fair value calculation being recognised in the
income statement.

2.9 Fair value estimation for financial instruments

The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such as publicly traded derivatives or
trading and available-for-sale securities) is based on quoted market prices at the reporting date. The quoted
market price used for traded financial assets held by the Cable & Wireless Communications Group is the
current bid price. The appropriate quoted market price for traded financial liabilities is the current offer
price. The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange market
rates at the reporting date.

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using
valuation techniques. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group uses a variety of methods which
include the use of recent arm’s length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the
same, discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models which reflect the specific instrument.

The nominal value of receivables (less estimated valuation allowances) and payables are assumed to
approximate their fair values. The fair value of financial liabilities measured at amortised cost for disclosure
purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that
is available to the Cable & Wireless Communications Group for similar financial instruments. Discounted
cash flows are used to determine the fair value for the majority of remaining financial instruments.

2.10 Impairment of assets (excluding financial instruments)

Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for
impairment. All other non-current assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. For the purposes of assessing
impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows
(cash generating units).

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group determines any impairment by comparing the carrying
values of each of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s assets (or cash generating units to which it
belongs) to their recoverable amounts which is the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its
value in use. Fair value represents market value in an active market. Value in use is determined by
discounting future cash flows arising from the asset. Future cash flows are determined with reference to the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s own projections using pre-tax discount rates which represent
the estimated weighted average cost of capital for the business. The approach, assumptions and results of the
impairment test are set out in note 17.

Impairment reviews involve management making assumptions and estimates, which are highly judgmental
and susceptible to change.

2.11 Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is the price paid less any rebates,
trade discounts or subsidies. It also includes delivery charges and import duties, but does not include value
added taxes or advertising and administration costs. Cost is based on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) principle.
For inventories held for resale, net realisable value is determined as the estimated selling price in the
ordinary course of business less costs to sell. For materials and consumables, provision is made for obsolete
and slow moving inventories as required.

F-17


-----

2.12 Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and at bank, short-term deposits, money market funds and
government securities. They are highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of
cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Cash and cash equivalents are carried
in the statement of financial position at cost. Bank overdrafts are included within loans in current liabilities
on the statement of financial position.

2.13 Invested capital

Invested capital is the cumulative investment in the Cable & Wireless Communications Group, and is
treated akin to equity in the historical financial information. It includes share capital and all other reserves
that were in existence prior to the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s Demerger from the Cable &
Wireless Group, as well as capital contributions to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group. On Demerger,
it is expected that there will be no contractual obligation for the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group to
repay these amounts and hence they have been treated as deductions from invested capital. These amounts
are recorded at cost. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or standalone options
are recognised in invested capital as a deduction from the issue proceeds. Incremental costs directly
attributable to the issue of new shares or options for the acquisition of a business are included in the cost of
acquisition.

2.14 Leases

Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Cable & Wireless Communications Group has
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are
capitalised at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset or the present value
of minimum lease payments. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as
to achieve a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The
corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in loans and obligations under finance
leases. These payments are split between capital and interest elements using the annuity method. The
property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases is depreciated over the shorter of the useful life
of the asset or the lease term.

Leases comprising a lease of land and a lease of buildings within a single contract are split into the two
component parts. The component part for buildings is then tested to determine whether the lease is a finance
or operating lease and treated accordingly.

Leases of land and all other leases are classified as operating leases and are not recognised in the statement
of financial position. Payments made under operating leases, net of lease incentives or premiums received,
are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.

2.15 Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale

When the value of non-current assets is expected to be recovered principally through sale rather than
through continuing use, they are classified as non-current assets held for sale. With the exception of deferred
tax assets, assets arising from employee benefits and financial instruments, these assets are classified as
current and are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.

Disposal groups are groups of assets and liabilities to be disposed of together as a group in a single
transaction. They are recognised as held for sale at the reporting date and are separately disclosed as current
assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position.

Measurement differences arising between the carrying amount and fair value less cost of disposal are treated
as impairment charges and separately disclosed.

2.16 Employee benefits

_Defined contribution pensions_

A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Cable & Wireless Communications Group
pays fixed contributions to a third-party. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group pays contributions
to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.
The Cable & Wireless Communications Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions

F-18


-----

have been paid. The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future
payments is available.

_Defined benefit obligations_

A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will
receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and
compensation. These schemes are generally funded through payments to insurance companies or trusteeadministered funds, determined by periodic actuarial calculations.

The asset (or liability) recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of each defined benefit
pension plan represents the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligations
and any asset ceiling adjustments at the reporting date. Defined benefit obligations for each scheme are
calculated semi-annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value
of these obligations is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of
high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid. The
bonds used will have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group recognises actuarial gains and losses, arising from
experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions, in the period in which they occur in the
statement of comprehensive income. Past service costs are recognised immediately in income, unless the
changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of
time (the vesting period). In these cases, the past service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the
vesting period.

Current service costs and any past service costs, together with the unwinding of the discount on plan
liabilities less the expected return on plan assets, are included within operating costs.

The IAS 19 surplus or deficit of defined benefit funds is adjusted to reflect the future economic benefits
available in the form of a cash refund or a reduction in future contributions, allowing for minimum funding
contributions in accordance with IFRIC 14. Any adjustment to the surplus is recorded directly in invested
capital.

_Other post-employment obligations_

Some Cable & Wireless Communications Group companies provide post-retirement healthcare benefits to
their retirees. The entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional on the employee remaining in service
up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits
are accrued over the period of employment using an accounting methodology similar to that for defined
benefit pension plans. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments, and changes in
actuarial assumptions, are dealt with in the same way as for defined benefit pension schemes. Independent
qualified actuaries value these obligations annually. Current service costs are charged to the income
statement.

_Share-based compensation_

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group operates various equity-settled, share-based compensation
plans. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised
as an expense over the vesting period. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is
determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, which excludes the impact of any
non-market vesting conditions (for example, service, profitability and sales growth targets). Non-market
vesting conditions are included in estimates about the number of options that are expected to vest. At each
reporting date, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group revises its estimates of the number of options
that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision of original non-market estimates, if any, in
the income statement, and a corresponding adjustment to invested capital over the remaining vesting period.

The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to invested capital when
the options are exercised.

_Termination benefits_

Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated before the normal retirement date or
whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Cable & Wireless

F-19


-----

Communications Group recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to the action
leading to the employee’s termination. Termination benefits falling due more than a year after the reporting
date are discounted to present value.

_Bonus plans_

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group recognises a liability where contractually obliged or where
there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.

_The Cable & Wireless Long Term Incentive Plan_

Cable and Wireless plc operates the LTIP. The plan rewards executive directors of Cable and Wireless plc
responsible for, and certain senior employees in, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group. The plan is
accounted for as an ‘other long term employee benefit’ in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits. The
amount recognised as a liability represents the estimated present value of the obligation at the reporting
date.

The LTIP creates a reward pool over a five year period from 1 April 2006 (or until a vesting event, if
earlier) depending on the extent to which the business has grown in value from its base valuation at the start
of the period (this period was changed from four to five years in July 2009).

Base valuations are adjusted over the performance period i) to reflect additional capital notionally treated as
borrowed by the business, ii) to reflect capital notionally treated as returned by the business, and iii)
increased by the notional weighted average cost of capital of the business (which will be at least 8% per
annum compounded). If the business’ value is lower than its adjusted base valuation at the end of the
performance period, there will be no reward pool. To the extent that the business’ value exceeds its adjusted
base valuation at the end of the performance period, 10% of the excess growth in value goes into the reward
pool.

Part of the reward pool was paid to participants up to the end of year three (31 March 2009), with a portion
payable (less payments made at end of year three) to participants at the end of year four (31 March 2010)
and the balance in full at the end of year five (31 March 2011). Measurement of the size of the reward pool
is carried out every six months to correspond with the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s
accounting periods. However, apart from awards held by participants who ceased employment as “good
leavers” no awards vested until the end of year three. In the event of a potential payment to an individual in
excess of US$31 million, the deferral period would be extended until 31 March 2012 or for a period of up to
one year following a vesting event, if earlier.

2.17 Tax

Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income
statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in invested capital, in which case it
is recognised in invested capital.

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using rates that have been
enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of prior
years.

Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements, except
where the difference arises from:

       - the initial recognition of goodwill; or

       - the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination,
affecting neither accounting nor taxable profit.

Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the temporary
differences reverse, based on rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available
against which the temporary differences can be utilised.

Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates and
interests in joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled
by the Cable & Wireless Communications Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not
reverse in the foreseeable future.

F-20


-----

2.18 Provisions

Provisions are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount. They are recognised when the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more
likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be
reliably estimated.

Provisions are presented in the statement of financial position at the present value of the estimated future
outflows expected to be required to settle the obligation. The discount rate is the pre-tax rate reflecting the
assessment of the settlement date. Provision charges and reversals are recognised in the income statement.
Discount unwinding is recognised as a finance expense.

Provisions are recognised for unavoidable lease payments in onerous contracts as the difference between the
rentals due and any income expected to be derived from the vacant properties being sublet. Redundancy
provisions, relating to both continuing and discontinued operations, comprise employee termination
payments. Legal provisions comprise legal fees and, where appropriate, expected settlement costs.

2.19 Revenue recognition

Cable & Wireless Communications Group revenue, which excludes discounts, value added tax and similar
sales taxes, represents the amount receivable in respect of services provided to customers. It includes sales
to joint ventures and associated companies but does not include sales by joint ventures and associated
companies or sales between Cable & Wireless Communications Group companies. Revenue is recognised
only when payment is probable.

Revenue from services is recognised as the services are provided. Revenue from service contracts that cover
periods of greater than 12 months is recognised in the income statement in proportion to the services
delivered at the reporting date. In respect of services invoiced in advance, amounts are deferred until
provision of the service.

Amounts payable by and to other telecommunications operators are recognised as the services are provided.
Charges are negotiated separately and are subject to continual review. Revenue generated through the
provision of these services is accounted for gross of any amounts payable to other telecommunications
operators for interconnect fees.

Mobile revenue comprises amounts charged to customers in respect of monthly access charges, airtime
usage, messaging, and the provision of other mobile telecommunications services. This includes data
services and information provision and revenue from the sale of equipment (including handsets).

Mobile monthly access charges are invoiced and recorded as part of a periodic billing cycle. Airtime, either
from contract customers as part of the invoiced amount or from prepaid customers through the sale of
prepaid cards, is recorded in the period in which the customer uses the service. Unbilled revenue resulting
from mobile services provided to contract customers from the billing cycle date to the end of each period is
accrued. Unearned monthly access charges relating to periods after each accounting period are deferred.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group earns revenue from the transmission of content and traffic on
its network originated by third-party providers. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group assesses
whether revenue should be recorded gross as principal or net as agent, based on the features of such
arrangements including the following indicators:

       - whether the Cable & Wireless Communications Group holds itself out as an agent;

       - establishment of the price;

       - provision of customer remedies;

       - performance of part of the service; and

       - assumption of credit risk.

Revenue from sales of telecommunications equipment is recognised upon delivery to the customer.

The total consideration on arrangements with multiple revenue generating activities (generally the sale of
telecommunications equipment and ongoing service) is allocated to those components that are separable
based on the estimated fair value of the components.

Revenue arising from the provision of other services, including maintenance contracts, is recognised evenly
over the periods in which the service is provided.

F-21


-----

2.20 Dividend income

Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established. Dividend income is
included within finance income.

2.21 Interest income

Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest
rate applicable.

2.22 Exceptional items

Exceptional items are material items which derive from individual events that fall within the ordinary
activities of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group that are identified as exceptional items by virtue
of their size, nature or incidence. Further detail on exceptional items is set out in note 6 and in the relevant
note for each item.

**3.** **Critical accounting estimates and judgements**

In the preparation of the consolidated historical financial statements, a number of estimates and assumptions have
been made relating to the performance and the financial position of the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group. Results may differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. The
Directors consider that the following discussion addresses the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s most
critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the presentation of its consolidated
financial performance and position. These particular policies require subjective and complex judgements, often
as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are uncertain.

3.1 Valuation of assets for purchase accounting

Where the Cable & Wireless Communications Group undertakes business combinations, the cost of
acquisition is allocated to tangible and other identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired and
assumed by reference to their estimated fair values at the time of acquisition. The remaining amount is
recorded as goodwill. Any value assigned to the identifiable assets is determined by reference to an active
market, independent appraisal or estimate by management based on cash flow projections. The latter
situation includes estimates and judgements regarding expectations for the economic useful lives of the
products and technology acquired. In this situation, where appropriate, third-party valuation specialists are
involved.

3.2 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group assigns useful lives and residual values to property, plant
and equipment based on periodic studies of actual asset lives and the intended use for those assets. Changes
in circumstances such as technological advances, prospective economic utilisation and physical condition of
the assets concerned could result in the actual useful lives or residual values differing from initial estimates.
Where the Cable & Wireless Communications Group determines that the useful life of property, plant and
equipment should be shortened or residual value reduced, it depreciates the net carrying amount in excess of
the residual value over the revised remaining useful life, thereby increasing depreciation expense. Any
change in an asset’s life or residual value is reflected in the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s
financial statements when the change in estimate is determined.

3.3 Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets

The Directors assess the impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (excluding
goodwill) whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable or otherwise as required by accounting standards. Factors that are considered important and
which could trigger an impairment review include the following:

       - obsolescence or physical damage;

       - significant changes in technology and regulatory environments;

       - significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;

       - significant changes in the use of its assets or the strategy for its overall business;

F-22


-----

       - significant negative industry or economic trends; and

       - significant decline in its share price for a sustained period and its market capitalisation relative to
net book value.

In addition, the Directors test goodwill at least annually for impairment.

The identification of impairment indicators, the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of the
recoverable amount for assets or cash generating units require significant judgement.

3.4 Revenue recognition

Judgement is required in assessing the application of the principles of revenue recognition in respect of
Cable & Wireless Communications Group revenues. This includes presentation of revenue as principal or as
agent in respect of income received from transmission of content provided by third parties.

3.5 Receivables valuation

The valuation allowance for trade receivables reflects the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s
estimates of losses arising from the failure or inability of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s
customers to make required payments. The allowance is based on the ageing of customer accounts, customer
credit-worthiness and the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s historical write-off experience.
Changes to the allowance may be required if the financial condition of its customers improves or
deteriorates. An improvement in financial condition may result in lower actual write-offs. Historically,
changes to the estimate of losses have not been material to the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s
financial position and performance.

3.6 Customer and supplier commitments

The nature of the telecommunications industry is such that estimates are often required to be made in
relation to customer or supplier commitments, the final outcome of which may not be known for some time.
It uses estimates of price or usage to determine the revenue and expense recognised in any period. These
estimates are periodically adjusted to reflect actual pricing or usage as such information becomes available
or is agreed. As issues arise or are resolved, accruals are created or released as appropriate—the net impact
of this is included in operating profit within the relevant line item.

3.7 Interconnection with other operators

As part of the normal course of business, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group interconnects with
other telecommunications operators. In certain instances it uses estimates to determine the amount of
revenue receivable from or expense payable to these other operators. The prices at which these services are
charged are sometimes regulated and may be subject to retrospective adjustment. Estimates are used in
assessing the likely impact of these adjustments.

Adjustments to interconnect estimates are taken to operating profit in the period in which the adjustments
are made.

3.8 Taxation

The tax charge is the sum of the total current and deferred tax charges or credits. The calculation of the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s total tax charge involves a degree of estimation and judgement
in respect of certain items where the tax treatment cannot be finally determined until a resolution has been
reached with the relevant tax authority or, if necessary, through a formal legal process. The final resolution
of some of these items may give rise to material income statement and/or cash flow variances.

The resolution of issues is not always within the control of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group
and is often dependent on the efficiency of the administrative and legal processes in the relevant tax
jurisdictions in which the Cable & Wireless Communications Group operates. Issues can, and often do, take
many years to resolve. Payments in respect of tax liabilities for an accounting period result from payments
on account and on the final resolution of open items. As a result there can be substantial differences between
the tax charge in the income statement and tax payments.

3.9 Recognition of deferred tax assets

The recognition of deferred tax assets is based upon whether it is probable that sufficient and suitable
taxable profits will be available in the future, against which the reversal of temporary differences can be
deducted. Recognition therefore involves judgement regarding the future financial performance of the
particular legal entity or tax group in which the deferred tax asset has been recognised.

3.10 Provisions

A provision is recognised when there is a present (legal or constructive) obligation in respect of a past event
as explained in the accounting policy in note 2.18. Judgement is required to quantify such amounts.

3.11 Pensions

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group provides several defined benefit pension schemes for its
employees. The asset (or liability) recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of defined
benefit pension plans represents the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit
obligations and asset ceiling adjustments at the reporting date. The expected cost of providing these defined
benefit pensions will depend on an assessment of such factors as:

       - the life expectancy of the members;

       - the length of service;

       - the rate of salary progression;

       - the rate of return earned on assets in the future;

       - the rate used to discount future pension liabilities; and

       - future inflation rates.

The assumptions used by the Cable & Wireless Communications Group are set out in note 32 and are
estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which may not necessarily be borne out in
practice but are comparable to the median estimates in this regard used by other FTSE 100 companies.
Changes to these assumptions could materially affect the size of the defined benefit schemes’ liabilities and
assets disclosed in note 32.

3.12 Fair value estimation

The basis of determining fair values is set out in note 2.9. Where market values are not available, fair values
are based on valuation methodologies which require inputs and forecasts to be made. Judgement is required
in determining the appropriate assumptions underlying those inputs and forecasts.

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using
valuation techniques. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group uses a variety of methods and makes
assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each reporting date.

Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments are used for long-term loans. Other
techniques, such as estimated discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value for the remaining
financial instruments. The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward
exchange market rates at the reporting date.

The nominal value less valuation adjustments of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate
their fair values. The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the
future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group for similar financial instruments.

3.13 Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)

The charge calculated in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits requires estimates of the valuation of
the Cable & Wireless Communications Group to determine the obligation for the LTIP. The estimates
require the use of a number of assumptions which, by their nature, are subjective.

Revenue is allocated to a geographical region based on the location in which the telecommunications services
were delivered. It does not follow necessarily that the international telecommunications traffic transiting the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s networks originates in that location. The Cable & Wireless
Communications Group does not have access to information on the original source or ultimate destination of
international telecommunications traffic.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group does not have any customers from which revenue exceeds 10% of
Cable & Wireless Communications Group revenue.

In 2008/09, the pre-exceptional gain on disposal of non-current assets of US$14 million principally arose on the
recycling of foreign currency reserve translation balances on liquidation of subsidiaries.

In 2007/08 the pre-exceptional gain on disposals of non-current assets of US$2 million reflected the release of a
provision related to the sale of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s interest in Bahrain
Telecommunications Company BSC (Batelco).

In 2006/07, exceptional gains on disposals of non-current assets of US$288 million reflected the gain on the sale of the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s interest in Batelco. The net cash proceeds received were US$481 million.
The tax charge attributable and non-controlling interest share were both US$nil. This interest was previously recorded
as assets held for sale.

insurance operation, Pender Insurance Limited (Pender), which ceased taking on new business in April 2003.

The exceptional gain of US$12 million in 2007/08 (2006/07—US$34 million) arose from the release of

Tax relief of US$nil is available on interest capitalised in the year ended 31 March 2009 (2007/08—US$2
million, 2006/07—US$2 million). Interest has been capitalised within property, plant and equipment at a rate of
5% (2007/08—7%, 2006/07—7%) on qualifying capital expenditure.

In 2008/09, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group entered into various foreign exchange contracts to
lock in the sterling cash value of the forecast cash repatriations from foreign operations as well as that of the
drawdowns on the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s US$415 million bank facility (see note 27). This
resulted in an exceptional finance expense of US$98 million from expiry of these contract during the year and
re-measuring open contracts to fair value at year end.

In 2007/08, a US$20 million exceptional finance expense related to the repurchase of convertible bonds with a
par value of US$276 million (£138 million) for cash of US$380 million (£190 million). The 2007/08 exceptional
accounting loss (not included in the table above) of US$20 million was the difference between the carrying and
fair value of the underlying debt component of the repurchased bonds. For further information, refer to note 27.

**14. Discontinued operations**

There were no businesses discontinued during the periods presented.

The net profit of US$18 million from discontinued operations in 2008/09 included the reversal of unutilised
provisions (see note 31) relating to the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s former US operations and
businesses disposed of in prior periods.

In 2007/08 the net profit of US$nil from discontinued operations relates to the reversal of unutilised provisions of

**15. Earnings per share**

Basic earnings per ordinary share is based on the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders and the
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding. The weighted average number of ordinary shares
outstanding used to calculate earnings per share is based on the number of shares expected on listing of Cable &
Wireless Communications. The shares expected on listing of Cable & Wireless Communications will be equal to
the outstanding shares of Cable and Wireless plc prior to the Scheme of Arrangement. Therefore, these shares are
considered to be the most appropriate denominator on which to compute earnings per share for the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group.

The number of shareholders electing to take all or part of their dividends in shares varies from dividend to
dividend. In 2008/09, 12,057 shareholders (2007/08—12,379 shareholders, 2006/07—13,009 shareholders)
owning 558 million shares (2007/08—708 million shares, 2006/07–370 million shares) elected to take the
interim dividend wholly or partly in shares. In 2008/09 12,138 shareholders (2007/08–12,531 shareholders,
2006/07—13,278 shareholders) owning 613 million shares (2007/08—122 million shares, 2006/07—689 million
shares) elected to take the prior year final dividend wholly or partly in shares. Consequently, total shares were
issued in 2008/09 with a value of US$83 million (2007/08—US$46 million, 2006/07—US$53 million). The
Cable & Wireless Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust waived its right to dividends on the shares held in the
trust.

**17. Impairment review**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group assessed the impairment of property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable or otherwise as required by accounting standards. Factors that are considered important, which could
trigger an impairment review, are set out in note 3.3.

**_Goodwill_**

As required by IFRS 3, a review of the carrying value of goodwill has been performed as at each year end. In
performing these reviews, the recoverable amount of goodwill has been determined by reference to the higher of
the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use of the continuing operations of the related businesses. No
impairments were required in any of the periods presented.

_Monaco Telecom_

Goodwill of US$175 million was allocated to Monaco Telecom at 31 March 2009 (31 March 2008–US$216
million, 31 March 2007—US$200 million). Three relevant cash generating units were identified for the purposes
of assessing the carrying value of Monaco Telecom’s network assets (domestic including the cable television
business, international business and other services). Goodwill has been allocated to this group of cash generating
units based on the fair value at the time of acquisition. The value in use was determined for each cash generating
unit by discounting future cash flows (based on the approved five year business plan extrapolated at long-term
growth rates of between 0% and 5%) at discount rates of between 8% and 18% (2006/07 and 2007/08—9% and
13%) (dependent on the risk adjusted cost of capital of different parts of the business). No impairment was
required in any of the periods presented.

The key assumptions in the calculation of value in use relate to revenue growth, operating cost margin and the
level of maintenance capital expenditure required to maintain the network at its current level. Monaco Telecom
operates under an exclusive operating agreement in Monaco and management’s forecasts were based on
historical experience for the business.

The goodwill’s value in use would not support the carrying value of the goodwill if earnings decreased or
maintenance capital expenditure increased by more than US$25 million per year; or the discount rate increased
by more than 9 percentage points.

**_Property, plant and equipment and other intangibles_**

_Year ended 31 March 2009_

There were no events or changes in circumstances during the year to indicate that the carrying value of property,
plant and equipment and other intangible assets had been impaired.

F-35


-----

_Year ended 31 March 2008_

There were no events or changes in circumstances during the year to indicate that the carrying value of property,
plant and equipment and intangible assets had been impaired, except as noted below:

_Cable & Wireless Jamaica_

A review of the carrying value of the property, plant and equipment of Cable & Wireless Jamaica Ltd, a
subsidiary of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group, was conducted at year end in the light of the poor
trading performance during the year.

The value in use was determined for each of the four cash generating units of the business (mobile, fixed, data
and Internet) by discounting estimated future cash flows (based on the company’s five year forecast) at a US
dollar equivalent discount rate of 11.7% The key assumptions in the calculation of value in use related to:

    - Revenue—a terminal growth rate of 0% to 2% depending on the cash generating unit;

    - Maintenance capital expenditure—assumed at an average of 5% of revenue in perpetuity; and

    - Operating costs—estimated to remain at broadly the same level throughout the projection (before
inflation).

These assumptions reflected the recent introduction of competition in the local market.

The impairment charge recognised in Cable & Wireless Jamaica Ltd that has been reflected in the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group income statement is US$74 million.

_Year ended 31 March 2007_

There were no events or changes in circumstances during the year to indicate that the carrying value of property,
plant and equipment and other intangible assets had been impaired, except as noted below:

_TSTT_

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group reviewed the carrying value of its investment in its joint venture
Telecommunications Services of Trinidad and Tobago Limited (TSTT) during the 2006/07 year in the light of the
poor trading performance and the introduction of competition during that year.

The value in use was determined for each of the three cash generating units of the business (fixed line, GSM
mobile and CDMA mobile) by discounting estimated future cash flows (based on the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s view) at a local currency discount rate of 14.2% The key assumptions in the
calculation of value related to:

    - Revenue—a decline of 18% was assumed to reflect the impact of liberalisation for the first time;

    - Maintenance capital expenditure—assumed at 7% of revenue; and

    - Operating costs—estimated to remain at broadly the same level throughout the projection (before
inflation).

These assumptions reflected the further impact of competition and fixed to mobile substitution in the local
market. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s share of the impairment charge that was reflected in the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group income statement was US$55 million.

The maximum exposure to credit risk for receivables is equal to the carrying value of those financial instruments.
There was no material difference between the carrying value and fair value of receivables during the periods
presented.

Concentrations of credit risks with respect to trade receivables were small as the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group customer base was large and unrelated. Receivables predominantly related to retail
customers, governments and corporate entities as well as other telecommunications operators.

-----

Credit risk procedures vary depending on the size or type of customer. These procedures include such activities
as credit checks, payment history analysis and credit approval limits. Based on these procedures, management
assessed the credit quality of those receivables that were neither past due nor impaired as low risk. There have
been no significant changes to the composition of receivables counterparties within the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group that indicate this would change in the future. In 2006/07 and 2007/08, there were no
material changes in the markets in which the Cable & Wireless Communications Group operates that indicated
an increased credit risk on receivables that are neither past due nor impaired. In 2008/09, there was an economic
downturn in markets in which the Cable & Wireless Communications Group operates. This would indicate an
increased credit risk on receivables that are neither past due nor impaired. However, management have assessed
this risk and, after providing additional valuation allowance where necessary, continue to support the assessment
of credit quality as low risk.

Due to the nature of the telecommunications industry, balances relating to interconnection with other carriers
often have lengthy settlement periods. Generally, interconnection agreements with major carriers resulted in
receivables and payables balances with the same counterparty. Industry practice is that receivable and payable
amounts relating to interconnection revenue and costs for a defined period are agreed between counterparties and
settled on a net basis.

There were no amounts held as collateral for trade and other receivables balances.

**_Sterling bonds_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group had the following sterling bonds at 31 March 2009:

(a) US$290 million (£200 million) listed bond due in 2012 with a balance outstanding, net of costs, of US$283
million (£195 million) (2007/08 – US$322 million (£161 million), 2006/07 – US$316 million (£161
million)). Interest was payable at 8.750% per annum. During the year ended 31 March 2009, bonds with a
par value, net of costs, of US$52 million (£36 million) were re-issued by Cable and Wireless plc for US$49
million (£34 million) net proceeds. During the year ended 31 March 2007, the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group repurchased but did not cancel US$38 million (£20 million) of this bond at an
average price of 197.3 cents (104.9 pence).

(b) US$290 million (£200 million) listed bond due in 2019 with a balance outstanding at 31 March 2009, net of
costs, of US$213 million (£147 million) (2007/08 – US$294 million (£147 million), 2006/07 – US$351
million (£179 million)). Interest was payable at 8.625% per annum. During the year ended 31 March 2008,
the Cable & Wireless Communications Group repurchased but did not cancel US$64 million (£32 million)
(2006/07 – US$2 million (£1 million)) of this bond at an average price of 204.6 cents (102.1 pence)
(2006/07 – 197.9 cents (105.25 pence)).

**_US dollar loans_**

Various US dollar-based loans of approximately US$153 million (2007/08 – US$162 million, 2006/07 – US$245
million) are held by various subsidiaries across the Cable & Wireless Communications Group, with the majority
in Panama. In 2008/09, interest on these loans ranges between 2% and 6.5%. The loans are repayable over a
period up to 2014.

**_Convertible unsecured bond_**

On 16 July 2003, £257,714,000 (US$418,572,000) of 4% convertible unsecured bonds were issued at par. Each
bond entitled the holder to convert the amount of such bond into fully paid Cable and Wireless plc ordinary
shares of 25 pence each at an amended rate of 689.655 ordinary shares for each £1,000 held at an initial
conversion price of 145 pence per ordinary share of Cable and Wireless plc at any time prior to 9 July 2010. Full
conversion of the bonds would have resulted in an additional 177,733,748 shares of Cable and Wireless plc being
issued.

During 2007/08, all of the convertible bonds in issue at 31 March 2007 were either repurchased or converted
(carrying value of US$418 million (£213 million)).

Convertible bonds with a par value of £138 million (US$276 million) were repurchased for cash of US$380
million. At the time of repurchase, the debt component of these convertible bonds had a carrying value of
US$234 million (£117 million). The fair value of the debt component of these bonds at the date of repurchase
was US$254 million (£127 million). This transaction resulted in a loss of US$20 million. The difference between
the fair value of the debt and the cash consideration (US$126 million (£63 million)) was allocated to the
repurchase of the equity component of the convertible bond.

The remaining convertible bonds, with a par value of US$240 million (£120 million), were converted into
83 million ordinary shares of Cable and Wireless plc (including 29 million treasury shares). The debt component
of these convertible bonds had a carrying value of US$206 million (£103 million).

A put option is held by the non-controlling shareholder of Monaco Telecom, the Principality of Monaco (the
Principality). This put option is measured at fair value using inputs that are not based on publicly observable
market data. The liability for the put option represents 45% of the market value of Monaco Telecom. This market
value has been determined by taking an average of published broker valuations for the business and attributing
45% of that value to the put option. The brokers have valued the business using a combination of discounted cash
flow analysis and EBITDA multiples factoring in the expected growth and risk of the business. A US$10 million
movement in the value of the put would have a US$1 million impact on the income statement.

The balance within financial liabilities held at fair value represents the fair value of the put option held by the
non-controlling shareholders of Monaco Telecom. Although the Cable & Wireless Communications Group
considers there to be only a remote likelihood of this put option being exercised, IAS 32 requires the present
value of the amount payable to be recognised as a liability regardless of the probability of exercise, as this is not
within the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s control. As this put option was issued as part of a
business combination, any change in remeasuring the derivative to fair value is recorded as an adjustment to
goodwill (refer to note 38).

The put option held by the Principality is exercisable in two tranches. The first tranche enables the Principality to
put 20% of the shares of Monaco Telecom to the Cable & Wireless Communications Group from six months
prior to 18 June 2011, 2014 and 2017. The second tranche enables the Principality to put 25% of the shares of
Monaco Telecom to the Cable & Wireless Communications Group three years after the first has been exercised.

During 2008/09, the value of the put option increased by US$24 million due to discount unwinding (see note 12).
This increase was offset by a US$12 million reduction as a result of fair value and foreign exchange movements.
This reduction was recognised against goodwill (see note 38).

**_Forward exchange contracts_**

Cable & Wireless Communications Group companies with functional currencies in sterling held forward
exchange contracts of US$225 million at 31 March 2009 hedging currency exposures in US dollars (2007/08 –
US$50 million hedging currency exposures in US dollars, 2006/07 – US$83 million hedging US and Jamaican
dollars). The Cable & Wireless Communications Group did not apply hedge accounting to the forward exchange
contracts. The contracts were revalued to fair value at each reporting date. In 2008/09, US$98 million of losses
on the contracts were recognised as an exceptional finance expense in the income statement (see note 12).

The tax losses carried forward at 31 March 2009 included UK capital losses of US$4,110 million (31 March
2008 – US$5,270 million, 31 March 2007 – US$5,390 million).

Deferred tax is not provided on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates where the Cable
& Wireless Communications Group controls the timing of remittance and it is probable that the temporary
difference will not reverse in the forseeable future. As at 31 March 2009, the aggregate amounts of temporary
differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches and joint ventures for which deferred tax
liabilities were not been recognised were US$1,007 million (31 March 2008 – US$934 million, 31 March 2007 –
US$916 million). These temporary differences relate to unremitted earnings.

**_Property_**

In the periods presented, provision was made for the lower of the best estimate of the unavoidable lease
payments or cost of exit in respect of vacant properties. Unavoidable lease payments represent the difference
between the rentals due and any income expected to be derived from the vacant properties being sub-let. The
provision was expected to be used over the shorter of the period to exit and the lease contract life.

In 2008/09, US$5 million (2007/08 – US$4 million, 2006/07 – US$6 million) of property provisions were
released in respect of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s former US operations.

**_Redundancy_**

In the periods presented, provision was made for the total employee related costs of redundancies announced
prior to the reporting dates. Amounts provided for and spent in the years primarily relate to the restructuring. The
provision was expected to be used within one year.

**_Network and asset retirement obligations_**

In the periods presented, provision was made for the best estimate of the unavoidable costs associated with
redundant leased network capacity. These provisions were expected to be used over the shorter of the period to
exit and the lease contract life.

Provision was also made for the best estimate of the asset retirement obligation associated with office sites,
technical sites, domestic and sub-sea cabling. This provision was expected to be used at the end of the life of the
related asset on which the obligation arose. Amounts utilised in the periods presented related predominantly to
cash expenditure against unavoidable costs associated with redundant network capacity.

**_Legal and other_**

In the periods presented, other provisions included amounts relating to specific legal claims against the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group, the disposal of previously discontinued US businesses, amounts relating to
specific claims held against the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s former insurance operation, Pender,
amounts relating to restructuring and rebranding, and amounts relating to acquisitions and disposals of Cable &
Wireless Communications Group companies and investments. The release of unused amounts reflected the
resolution of claims and other risks during the year.

**32. Retirement benefits obligations**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group operated pension and other retirement schemes, which covered
the majority of employees in the Cable & Wireless Communications Group. These schemes included both
defined benefit schemes, where retirement benefits were based on the employee’s remuneration and length of
service, and defined contribution schemes, where retirement benefits reflect the accumulated value of agreed
contributions paid by, and in respect of, employees. Contributions to the defined benefit schemes were made in
accordance with the recommendations of independent actuaries who value the schemes. The main UK defined
benefit pension scheme operated by the Cable & Wireless Group was closed to new members in 1998.

**_Defined contribution schemes_**

The pension cost for 2008/09 for the defined contribution schemes of the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group was US$9 million (2007/08 – US$8 million, 2006/07 – US$5 million), of which US$3 million (2007/08 –
US$4 million, 2006/07 – US$2 million) was for the main UK defined benefit pension scheme operated by the
Cable & Wireless Group.

**_Defined benefit schemes_**

_Main UK defined benefit pension scheme operated by the Cable & Wireless Group—funding valuation_

Historically the main UK scheme has been allocated between the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group and the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group on a ratio of 80:20 (see note 2.1 for further detail). The figures below
relate to the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s 20% allocation unless otherwise stated.

The latest triennial actuarial valuation was carried out by Watson Wyatt Limited as at 31 March 2007. The
projected unit credit method was used and the principal actuarial assumptions adopted were that the annual rate
of inflation would be 3.1% and that future increases in pensionable earnings would be 4.1% per annum;
investments held in respect of pensions before they become payable would average 6.2% annual rate of return;
investments held in respect of pensions after they become payable would average 4.9% annual rate of return; and
pensions would increase at an annual rate of 3% for fixed rate increasing pensions and 3.1% for inflation related
pensions. As at 31 March 2007, the value of the assets represented approximately 99% of the actuarial value of
benefits due to members calculated on the basis of pensionable earnings and service at 31 March 2007 on an
ongoing basis and allowing for projected increases in pensionable earnings.

The assumptions regarding current mortality rates in retirement were set having regard to the actual experience of
the Fund’s pensioners and dependants over the five years ended 31 March 2007. In addition, allowance was made
for future mortality improvements in line with medium cohort projections of the 1992 mortality series tables
published by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, subject to a minimum annual rate of improvement of 1.5%.

Based on these assumptions, the life expectancies of pensioners aged 60 are as follows:


**On 31 March**
**2009**
**(years)**


**On 31 March**
**2019**
**(years)**

The actuarial valuation revealed that the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s share of the deficit at
31 March 2007 in the defined benefit section was US$6 million on the basis of the funding assumptions adopted
by the actuary. An US$8 million contribution made to the scheme by Cable & Wireless Communications Group
on 28 March 2008 was calculated on the basis of the US$6 million deficit at 31 March 2007, together with the
interest cost that accrued on this amount during the year and the backdating of the increased employer’s
contribution rate to the valuation date. As a result of the US$8 million contribution and the contribution by the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group, the scheme was fully funded on an ongoing basis, based on the 2007
valuation.

The actuarial valuation showed that based on long-term financial assumptions the contribution rate required to
meet the future benefit accrual was 33.2% of pensionable earnings (28.5% employer’s and 4.7% employee’s).
This contribution rate will be reviewed when the next independent actuarial valuation is carried out, which will
be based on the position at 31 March 2010. The terms of the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund Trust Deed
also allow the trustees or Cable and Wireless plc to call for a valuation at any time. The future service
contribution rate includes an allowance of 3% for administration expenses, excluding the Pension Protection
Fund (PPF) levy. The PPF levy due for 2008/09 was US$110,409 (2007/08 – US$135,878, 2006/07 –
US$97,420). Employers therefore paid a total contribution rate in 2007/08 of 29.4% (2007/08 – 29.3%, 2006/07
– 22.3%), or US$3.7 million (2007/08 – US$4.7 million, 2006/07 – US$3.9 million).

As part of the agreement of the valuation assumptions with the trustees, the Cable & Wireless Group has agreed a
contingent funding agreement, including a requirement to provide certain financial information to allow the
trustees to monitor the Cable & Wireless Group’s financial performance. Should the Cable & Wireless Group’s
projected EBITDA fall below an agreed level, and the cash and committed facilities (net of any prior ranking

creditors) available to the Cable & Wireless Group also fall below an agreed level, the Cable & Wireless Group
would provide security to the trustees in the form of an escrow arrangement or bank letter of credit for an amount
equal to the shortfall against the agreed level of cash and committed facilities (net of any prior ranking creditors).

During 2008/09, the Pension Trustees of the main UK defined benefit pension scheme operated by the Cable &
Wireless Group agreed a buy-in of the UK pensioner element of the scheme with Prudential Insurance. The
buy-in involved the purchase of a bulk annuity policy by the scheme under which Prudential Insurance assumed
responsibility for the benefits payable to the scheme’s UK pensioners with effect from 1 August 2008. The
pensioner liabilities and the matching annuity policy remain within the scheme. The total premium for the
annuity policy was approximately US$1,750 million which the scheme settled with a combination of cash and
assets including an additional Cable & Wireless Communications Group contribution of US$4 million.

**_Main UK scheme and other schemes—IAS 19 Employee Benefits valuation_**

The actuarial valuations of the major defined benefit schemes and medical plans operated by the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group were updated to 30 September 2009 by qualified independent actuaries for all
subsidiaries. Watson Wyatt Limited prepared the valuation for the main UK scheme and unfunded schemes, and
reviewed the actuarial valuations prepared for subsidiaries. Other schemes included unfunded liabilities in the
United Kingdom relating to pension provisions for former Directors and other senior employees in respect of
their earnings in excess of the previous Inland Revenue salary cap. Also included are the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s overseas schemes in Macau, Jamaica, Barbados and Guernsey. The main financial
assumptions applied in the valuations and an analysis of schemes’ assets are as follows:

Assumptions used by the actuary are best estimates from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which may
not necessarily be borne out in practice. The assumptions shown above for Other schemes represent a weighted
average of the assumptions used for the individual schemes, which similarly may not be borne out in practice.

A one year increase or decrease in the life expectancy assumptions would have changed the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s share of the main UK defined benefit pension scheme liabilities by around US$10
million. A 0.25% change in the discount rate used to value the scheme liabilities would have changed the
liabilities by around US$34 million. A 0.25% change in the assumed rate of salary increases would have changed
the liabilities required by around US$2 million.

The overall expected rate of return for each pension scheme is a weighted average of the expected asset return for
each asset class. The expected asset return for each asset class has been set as a best estimate of the long-term
return that will be achieved for the particular asset class in the country in question having regard to investment
yields on the measurement date.

The main UK defined benefit pension scheme operated by the Cable & Wireless Group is closed to new entrants.
Under the projected unit credit method used for the valuation of liabilities, the current service cost will increase
when expressed as a percentage of pensionable payroll as the members of the scheme approach retirement.

During 2008/09, the defined benefit and retirement medical plans of Cable & Wireless Jamaica were restructured
in order to reduce financial risk materially. The restructure involved the purchase of annuities for all of the
defined benefit obligations, a change in member benefits and the transfer of all of the retirement medical plan
obligations to a third-party insurer. The restructure resulted in a curtailment gain of US$18 million. The transfer
of the retirement medical plan obligations resulted in a settlement loss of US$6 million. The curtailment gain and
settlement loss have been recorded as a net exceptional gain of US$12 million. There was also an exceptional
curtailment gain in Barbados of US$2 million in the period. Refer to note 6.

Included within these liabilities is an amount of US$21 million (2007/08 – US$26 million, 2006/07 – US$28
million) to cover the cost of former Directors’ pension entitlements.

The IAS 19 surplus or deficit of defined benefit funds is adjusted to reflect the future economic benefits available
in the form of a cash refund or a reduction in future contributions, allowing for minimum funding contributions
in accordance with IFRIC 14. Any adjustment to the surplus is recorded directly in equity. The effect of these
adjustments (described as asset ceiling adjustments) was US$13 million in 2008/09 (2007/08 – US$211 million,
2006/07 – US$43 million).

The amounts recognised in the income statement are as follows:

A pre-exceptional defined benefit credit of US$10 million (2007/08 – US$14 million credit, 2006/2007 – US$2
million credit) has been included in employee benefit expenses (note 9).

The actual return on plan assets was a loss of US$138 million (2007/08 – gain of US$74 million, 2006/07 – gain
of US$102 million).

Net actuarial losses amounting to US$201 million (2007/08 – gains of US$112 million, 2006/07 – gains of
US$51 million) have been recognised directly in equity and are presented in the statement of comprehensive
income. In addition an actuarial gain of US$201 million (2007/08 – loss of US$168 million, 2006/07 – loss of
US$25 million) has been recognised in the statement of comprehensive income due to the change in the effect of
asset ceilings including the effect of foreign currencies. The total amount recognised in the statement of
comprehensive income in the current financial year and cumulatively to 31 March 2009 is US$nil (2007/08 – loss
of US$56 million, 2006/07 – gain of US$26 million) and loss of US$1 million (2007/08 – loss of US$1 million,
2006/07 – gain of US$55 million) respectively.

The pension disclosures above include three post-retirement medical plans, one in Jamaica and two in Barbados.
An increase or decrease in the assumed medical cost trend of 1% would have had no material effect on the
aggregate of current service costs and interest costs during the periods presented and would have increased/
(decreased) the accumulated defined benefit obligation by US$2 million/US$(1) million (2007/08 – US$6
million/US$(6) million, 2006/07 – US$5 million/US$(4) million).

**33. Capital management**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group defines capital as invested capital, being the net accumulation of
shareholders and non-controlling interests in the Cable & Wireless Communications Group.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s objective in managing capital is to maintain a capital structure
that optimises returns to shareholders having regard to the liquidity requirements and the relative cost of debt and
equity. It does not have any externally imposed requirement for managing capital, other than those imposed by
company law.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group manages its capital position in such a way as to optimise the
weighted average cost of debt and equity taking into account:

- the liquidity required in the light of the projected funding requirements of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s operating businesses with an appropriate level of contingency;

- the level of financial strength required to maintain the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s terms of
trade taking account of its operational cash generation;

- the relative post-tax cost of debt and equity; and

- the extent to which external debt finance is, or is likely to be, available to the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group on acceptable terms.

-----

This strategy is unchanged from previous years.

The Cable and Wireless plc Articles currently permit borrowing up to two and a half times the adjusted capital
and reserves of Cable & Wireless Groups’. The Cable & Wireless Communications articles permit borrowings up
to the greater of (i) three times the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s adjusted capital or reserves or
(ii) US$3 billion. Post-Demerger, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group will have funding in place to
meet its investment plans and the relevant borrowing limit has been adjusted to reflect its required funding levels.
Cable & Wireless Communications believes the expression of such borrowing limit as the greater of a multiple of
adjusted capital and reserves or a fixed limit is a more appropriate formulation to provide the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group with required flexibility in the short term.

During the period, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group actively managed its capital position by
repurchasing a proportion of its convertible bonds so as to limit dilution to existing shareholders. The Cable &
Wireless Communications Group also ensures that sufficient funds and distributable reserves are held to allow
payments of projected dividends to shareholders. This process is managed through the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s budget and five year forecast process.

**34. Share-based payments**

**_Share option schemes_**

The share option schemes in operation during the periods presented or having options outstanding as at the end of
the periods presented were as follows:

**_Cable & Wireless Employee Savings Related Share Option Scheme (UK SAYE) and Cable & Wireless Global_**
**_Savings Related Share Option Scheme (Global SAYE)_**

Under the UK SAYE, UK employees were invited to enter into a savings contract with a bank to save regular
monthly sums of between £5 and £250 for a period of either three, five or seven years. At the end of the savings
contract, the participant receives interest from the bank on their savings. The savings and the interest may then be
used to exercise an option over Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Shares, which are acquired at a discount of 20%
to the market value of Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Shares at the date of grant. The UK SAYE Scheme was
last offered in December 2003. Cable and Wireless plc extended the SAYE scheme to its overseas employees
through the Global SAYE. The Global SAYE scheme was last offered in December 2004. In various of the Cable
and Wireless plc’s territories (excluding the United Kingdom) it operated along similar lines to the UK SAYE
with local variations to accommodate local legal and tax considerations.

**_Cable & Wireless Revenue Approved Share Option Scheme and Cable & Wireless Senior Employees’ Share_**
**_Option Scheme_**

Prior to July 2001, Cable and Wireless plc granted share options under the Cable & Wireless Senior Employees’
Share Option Scheme (SESOS) and the Cable & Wireless Revenue Approved Share Option Scheme (RESOS).
Options awarded under these plans between June 1999 and July 2001 were subject to performance conditions
based on the total shareholder return (TSR) performance of Cable and Wireless plc relative to the FTSE 100
Index, underpinned by real growth in EBITDA and revenue. TSR is share price growth adjusted for dividends
and capital actions. TSR performance was averaged over a three month period at the beginning and end of the
performance period. This moderated the effect of short-term share price volatility. For full vesting, the TSR
performance of Cable and Wireless plc must have achieved at least upper quartile level against the FTSE 100
between the third and fifth anniversaries of the date of grant. Half vesting applied for TSR at the median level,
with a sliding scale between median and upper quartile. If the performance conditions were not met by the fifth
anniversary of the date of grant, the options would have lapsed. None of these options achieved their
performance conditions and therefore they have all lapsed.

Options granted under RESOS and SESOS before June 1999 became exercisable if growth in Cable and Wireless
plc’s published earnings per share (excluding exceptional items) measured over any period of three consecutive
financial years, commencing not earlier than the financial year in which the option was granted, exceeded by not
less than 6% of the percentage growth of the Retail Price Index over the same three year period. All such options
became exercisable in full.

No further grants will be made under the RESOS and SESOS plans and there are no outstanding options under
those plans.

F-55


-----

**_Options under the Cable & Wireless Incentive Plan 2001 (approved and unapproved)_**

The level of any share option award is determined by the Cable & Wireless Remuneration Committee each year
by reference to total remuneration within a market peer group, subject to an overriding annual limit of ten times
salary for executive directors of Cable and Wireless plc.

The vesting of share options awarded to the executive directors of Cable and Wireless plc and to all employees
outside the United States is subject to relative TSR performance conditions. If performance conditions for these
options have not been met by the third anniversary of the date of grant the option lapses. For options granted
from June 2005, 33.33% of options vest where TSR performance meets the median. 100% of options vest where
TSR performance meets or exceeds the upper quartile, with a straight line proportion vesting between those
levels. In addition, the Cable & Wireless Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that the underlying financial
performance of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group warrants the release of the Cable and Wireless plc
Ordinary Shares. All outstanding options under the IP 2001 are currently vested.

**_The Cable & Wireless Employee Share Ownership Trust (Cable & Wireless ESOT)_**

The Cable & Wireless ESOT is a discretionary trust, which has been funded by loans from Cable and Wireless
plc to acquire Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Shares. At 31 March 2009 the Cable & Wireless ESOT holds
28,322,351 Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Shares (31 March 2008 – 26,859,407, 31 March 2007 – 36,792,665)
with a cost of US$86 million (£59 million) and a market value of US$58 million (£40 million) (31 March 2008 –
cost of US$146 million (£73 million), market value of US$80 million (£40 million), 31 March 2007 – cost of
US$196 million (£100 million), market value of US$120 million (£61 million)).

The costs of running the Cable & Wireless ESOT are included in the income statement as they accrue. The
trustees of the Cable & Wireless ESOT may notionally allocate Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Shares annually
to executive directors or other senior executives and other key employees. Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary
Shares are held in trust until such time as they may be transferred to employees in accordance with the terms of
Cable and Wireless plc’s share incentive plans, details of which are given above and below. The trustees of the
Cable & Wireless ESOT may acquire Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Shares through the issuance of new Cable
and Wireless plc Ordinary Shares, the transfer of Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Shares held in treasury or the
purchase of existing Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Shares in issue. Surplus Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary
Shares may be held to satisfy future awards. The Cable & Wireless ESOT has waived its rights to dividends. At
31 March 2009, in respect of Cable & Wireless Communications Group employees there were 1,339,778 Cable
and Wireless plc Ordinary Shares under performance share awards under the IP 2001 (31 March 2008 –
1,042,377, 31 March 2007 – 1,851,722), 18,194,249 Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Shares under restricted
share awards (31 March 2008 – 15,633,917, 31 March 2007 – 9.521,863), nil Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary
Shares under awards under the DSTIP (31 March 2008 – 988,907, 31 March 2007 – 1,702,848), 29,898 Cable
and Wireless plc Ordinary Shares under stock appreciation rights (31 March 2008 – 140,405, 31 March 2007 –
83,126), and 2,025,407 Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Shares under options under the IP 2001 (31 March 2008
– 7,080,142, 31 March 2007 – 7,305,072). At 31 March 2007 there were 108,029 shares under the deferred bonus
scheme.

**_Other equity instrument awards_**

_Cable & Wireless Deferred Short Term Incentive Plan (DSTIP)_

The DSTIP is designed to encourage participants to invest in Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Shares to align
their interests more closely with those of shareholders. Under the DSTIP any bonus deferred is used to purchase
Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Shares, which are held in trust for three years before being released to the
participant.

Participants may also be awarded up to two matching shares for every one purchased share based on the relative
TSR performance of the Cable and Wireless plc measured over a three year period (see performance conditions
for share-based awards on page F-57). A dividend award supplement also operates on the DSTIP. Dividends that
would have been paid on the purchased shares and the award of matching shares during the performance period
are reinvested in additional shares.

No award has been made under the DSTIP since September 2005.

F-56


-----

_Deferred bonus scheme_

Executive directors of Cable and Wireless plc and selected senior executives were able voluntarily to defer
between 10% and 50% of their post-tax senior management bonus to purchase Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary
Shares, which were held in the Cable & Wireless ESOT. Half of the purchased shares were held in the Cable &
Wireless ESOT for a two year deferral period and the remaining half were held in the Cable & Wireless ESOT
for a three year deferral period. Participants were awarded matching shares when the purchased shares vest at the
end of the deferral periods.

No award has been made under the deferred bonus scheme since June 2004.

_Performance share awards under the IP 2001_

Under the IP 2001, executive directors of Cable and Wireless plc and other senior executives can receive awards
of performance shares at nil cost.

The vesting of performance shares is subject to relative or absolute TSR performance conditions (see
performance conditions for share-based awards on page F-57). A dividend award supplement applies to
performance shares. Dividends that would have been paid on the performance shares which vest, will be regarded
as having been re-invested in additional Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary shares.

_Cable & Wireless Restricted Share Plan (RSP 2005)_

The RSP 2005 provides for awards of restricted shares to executives and selected employees other than executive
directors of Cable and Wireless plc. Generally, 50% of any restricted shares awarded under the RSP 2005 vest
after one year with the remaining 50% vesting after three years.

_Restricted Shares under the IP 2001_

Restricted shares have also been used to award matching shares with performance conditions to executive
directors of Cable and Wireless plc who invested their own funds into Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Shares.
Attainment of these matching shares is dependent on the executive director continuing to hold the invested shares
and on meeting the required TSR performance conditions (if applicable). 100% of any matching shares awarded
vest after three years.

**_Performance conditions for share-based awards_**

The Cable & Wireless Remuneration Committee considers TSR the main performance measure used in share
plans where performance conditions apply, as it provides an objective external measure of financial performance
and also considers the underlying financial performance of Cable and Wireless plc at the end of the performance
period.

**_Cash-based awards_**

_Stock appreciation rights under the IP 2001 and RSP 2005 (SARs)_

SARs are used to replicate the plans described above, but rewards are delivered as a cash equivalent. SARs are
used in exceptional cases for countries in which tax or legal issues preclude the use of real shares or share
options.

Cable and Wireless plc also offers its employees who are chargeable to income tax, under Section 15 Income Tax
(Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003, the SPP which is an HMRC approved share incentive plan. Under the SPP,
employees can contribute up to a value of £1,500 or 10% of salary each tax year (whichever is the lower), to buy
partnership shares in Cable and Wireless plc, and Cable and Wireless plc will offer a match of one share for each
partnership share purchased.

Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Shares are held in a UK resident trust and can be withdrawn from the trust at
any time, but there may be pay as you earn taxation and national insurance contributions payable in such events
if the Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Shares have not been held in the trust for five years. Dividends on the
partnership and matching shares are reinvested in additional dividend shares.

_High Performance Incentive Plan (HPIP)_

The HPIP provides for share awards at nil cost to senior managers in the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group. It is a three year incentive plan and the scheme is worth up to 100% of a participant’s salary at the date he
or she entered the plan. The awards are based on performance in years one and two that then vest after years two
and three respectively, with the financial year 2006/07 being year one. The performance targets are based on
EBITDA and cash flow. On vesting, the awards are worth the greater of the prevailing market value and the grant
price. A relatively small element of the HPIP is formed as a ‘Phantom’ HPIP whereby the payments under the
plan are made in cash rather than in shares.

There were no share options granted in 2008/09 and 2007/08. In 2006/07, 13 million options were granted with a
weighted average fair value at the measurement date of 22 pence. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group

computed the fair value of share option awards using the Monte Carlo pricing model. The expected volatility was
determined based on the statistical analysis of daily share prices over a historical period equal to the expected
lives of the options. Performance and other market conditions attached to awards were reflected in the calculation
of fair value as part of the Monte Carlo simulations.

The performance share awards made during 2008/09 are subject to performance conditions. None of the
restricted share awards made during 2008/09 had TSR conditions applicable (2007/08 – 5.5 million, 2006/07 –
2.9 million). The remaining awards had no performance conditions attached in the periods presented.

A fair value exercise was completed at 31 March 2009 and 31 March 2008 for grants made during those years
using the Monte Carlo method.

In the SPP, Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Shares were bought each month by the Halifax Corporate Trustees
Limited on behalf of the Cable & Wireless Group to match the investment of the employees. Matching shares
were awarded to the employee after three years, or earlier if a good leaver.

**36. Commitments**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group had capital commitments at 31 March 2009 relating to the purchase
of property, plant and equipment of US$37 million (2007/08 – US$28 million, 2006/07 – US$39 million). No
provision was made for these commitments. At 31 March 2009, US$29 million (2007/08 – US$26 million, 2006/07
– US$22 million) of these commitments related to the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s share of the
capital commitments of its joint ventures and associates.

In addition, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group had a number of operating commitments arising in the
ordinary course of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business. The most significant of these related
to network operating and maintenance costs. In the event of default of another party, the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group may be liable to additional contributions under the terms of the agreements.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group leased land and buildings and networks under various lease
agreements. The leases had varying terms, escalations, clauses and renewal rights.

**37. Guarantees and contingent liabilities**

At 31 March 2009, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group had US$705 million of guarantees for which
no provision has been made in the financial statements (31 March 2008 – US$565 million, 31 March 2007 –
US$374 million).

Trading guarantees principally comprised performance bonds issued in the normal course of business,
guaranteeing that the Cable & Wireless Communications Group or Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group would
meet their respective obligations to complete projects in accordance with the contractual terms and conditions.
The guarantees contained a clause that they would be terminated on final acceptance of work to be done under
the contract. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group has provided guarantees to third parties in respect of
trading contracts between these third parties and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group. Included in the
amounts disclosed above are amounts relating to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s contracts of US$670
million. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has agreed a fee schedule with Cable & Wireless
Communications Group for the benefit of these guarantees. To date, the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group has not been required to make any payments in respect of its obligations under its trading guarantees.

Other guarantees include guarantees for financial obligations principally in respect of borrowings, leases and
letters of credit.

Whilst Pender, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s former insurance operation, ceased to underwrite
new business from April 2003, it has in the past written policies in favour of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group and third parties. Potentially significant insurance claims have been made against Pender
under certain of these third-party policies, which have also given rise to uncertainties and potential disputes with
reinsurers. Significant progress has been made in resolving these claims. Detail of these insurance claims and
potential claims are not disclosed as such disclosure may be prejudicial to the outcome of such claims.

In addition the Cable & Wireless Communications Group has, as is considered standard practice in such
agreements, given guarantees and indemnities in relation to a number of disposals of subsidiary undertakings in
prior years. Generally, liability has been capped at no more than the value of the sales proceeds, although some
uncapped indemnities have been given. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group also gives warranties and
indemnities in relation to certain agreements including facility sharing agreements. Some of these agreements do
not contain liability caps.

Companies within the Cable & Wireless Communications Group have previously participated in the Merchant
Navy Officers Pension Fund (MNOPF). All Cable & Wireless Communications Group companies have since
ceased to participate in the MNOPF, but following a court judgment on the nature of the MNOPF rules, Cable
and Wireless plc may be liable for future contributions to fund a portion of any future MNOPF funding deficit.
Currently, the estimated outflow for this potential liability is not expected to have a significant adverse impact on
the financial position of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group.

**38. Business combinations and acquisitions of non-controlling interests**

The only subsidiaries acquired in 2007/08 were those in the Connecteo Group. There were no subsidiaries
acquired during 2006/07.

**_Connecteo Group_**

In January 2008, the Group purchased a 49% stake in the Connecteo Group and gained management control of
the holding company for cash consideration of US$14 million. The Connecteo Group provides satellite, data and

F-61


-----

Internet services in Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Guinea, Niger and Senegal. In January 2009, the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group paid US$8 million for a further 16% interest in the Connecteo Group.

The Directors performed a preliminary assessment of the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired as
property, plant and equipment (US$4 million) and net working capital liabilities (US$2 million). The excess of
consideration over the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities was allocated to goodwill. Goodwill arising
on the acquisition included the value of expected synergies, specialised knowledge and other intangible assets
that do not meet the recognition criteria set out in IAS 38 Intangible Assets.

In 2008/09, subsequent to this preliminary valuation of goodwill and intangibles, an exercise was conducted to
identify and value any further intangibles at the date of acquisition. This resulted in the recognition of an
additional US$2 million of licence intangible assets and a corresponding reduction in goodwill.

The contribution from Connecteo to revenues and operating profit from the date of acquisition to 31 March 2008
was less than US$1 million and US$nil respectively. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 April 2007 the
contribution to Cable & Wireless Communications Group revenue would have been US$6 million and the
contribution to operating profit would have been US$nil.

During 2008/09, the Connecteo Group increased its effective interest in its subsidiaries during the period. This
transaction resulted in a decrease of US$2 million of non-controlling interest and a US$2 million increase in
other reserves.

**_Monaco Telecom_**

Goodwill in connection with the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s investment in Monaco Telecom
SAM decreased by US$41 million during 2008/09 (2007/08 – US$16 million increase, 2006/07 – US$79 million
increase). The goodwill balance changed as a result of dividends and exchange movements offset by changes in
the fair value of the put option.

As part of the acquisition of Monaco Telecom a put option was issued (see note 28). Changes in the fair value of
this put option were treated as contingent consideration and adjusted against goodwill. Cash dividends paid to the
Principality of Monaco reflected an increase in the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s investment in
Monaco Telecom and therefore an increase to goodwill. The goodwill balance also changed as a result of
exchange movements.

**_Cable & Wireless St Kitts and Nevis Limited_**

On 21 September 2007, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group purchased an additional 17% shareholding in
Cable & Wireless St Kitts and Nevis Limited for cash consideration of US$14 million. The shares were previously
held by the government of the Federation of St Kitts and Nevis (the Federation). As a result of the acquisition, the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s effective interest in Cable & Wireless St Kitts and Nevis Limited was
increased from 65% to 82%. This transaction resulted in US$6 million of non-controlling interests transferred to
retained earnings and a US$14 million decrease in other reserves. As part of the purchase agreement with the
government, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group committed to offer 5% of the shares acquired to
residents of the Federation which were subscribed in full, reducing the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s
effective interest to 77%.

**39. Related party transactions**

**_Transactions with joint ventures and associates_**

All trade transactions with joint ventures and associates arose in the normal course of business and primarily
related to fees for use of Cable and Wireless plc’s products and services, network and access charges. There were
no material trade transactions with joint ventures and associates during the periods presented.

F-62


-----

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group received dividends of US$30 million from joint ventures
(2007/08 – US$30 million, 2006/07 – US$30 million) during the year ended 31 March 2009 and dividends from
associates of US$13 million during the year ended 31 March 2007 (the Group had no associates in the years
ended 31 March 2008 and 2009), as set out in note 20. Amounts owed by joint ventures and associates in respect
of trading balances are set out in note 22.

**_Transactions with key management employees_**

During 2008/09, two Directors of Cable & Wireless Communications purchased bonds issued by Cable &
Wireless. These bonds were purchased for US$4,169,670 (£2,371,691) on the open market (including
US$209,179 (£118,980) of accrued interest) and had a nominal value at 31 March 2009 of US$3,812,974
(£2,630,000). The interest earned on those bonds during the year was US$109,184 (£62,093) of which
US$79,163 (£54,607) remained unpaid at year end.

During 2008/09, the spouse of a Director of Cable & Wireless Communications purchased bonds issued by Cable
& Wireless. These bonds were purchased for US$768,602 (£437,178) on the open market (including US$67,124
(£38,180) of accrued interest) and had a nominal value at 31 March 2009 of US$695,904 (£480,000). The interest
earned on those bonds during the year was US$7,778 (£4,424) of which US$987 (£681) remained unpaid at year
end.

In 2007/08 and 2006/07, there were no material transactions with key management employees, including loans
advanced to Directors or other key managers, except for those relating to remuneration, disclosed in notes 9 and
45, and shareholdings.

**40. Licences and operating agreements with governments**

In a number of countries the Cable & Wireless Communications Group holds licences to operate or operating
agreements with governments. These licences take a variety of forms and their terms, rights and obligations
varied significantly. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group assumes that it will renew licences as they
expire. Previous history indicates this is the most likely outcome. Were renewal not to occur, in most cases the
business or its assets would be transferred to the new operator or government at fair or net book value. In a small
number of locations, transfer is at a value below net book value. In these places the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group monitors closely the likelihood of licence renewal in order to ensure that should a
licence not be renewed, the business’ assets have been written down to their recoverable value at the point of
transfer.

There were no significant changes to the terms of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s licences
during 2007/08 and 2006/07. In December 2008, the licence held by the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group’s subsidiary (formerly joint venture) in the Maldives was extended until 2023. Further, the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group has agreed with the government an extension to its operating agreement in
Macau until 2016 with an automatic extension until 2021.

**41. Legal proceedings**

In the ordinary course of business, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group is involved in litigation
proceedings, regulatory claims, investigations and reviews. The facts and circumstances relating to particular
cases are evaluated in determining whether it is more likely than not that there will be a future outflow of funds
and, once established, whether a provision relating to a specific case is necessary or sufficient. Accordingly,
significant management judgment relating to contingent liabilities is required since the outcome of litigation is
difficult to predict. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group does not expect the ultimate resolution of the
actions to which it is a party to have a significant adverse impact on the financial position of the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group.

In July 2007, Cable and Wireless plc and four Cable & Wireless Communications Group subsidiaries along with
Telecommunications Services of Trinidad and Tobago Limited (TSTT), in which the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group holds a 49% interest, were served with proceedings in the English High Court by a
Caribbean competitor, Digicel. The claim alleged that the relevant Cable & Wireless Communications Group
subsidiaries delayed Digicel’s entry into six Caribbean markets (St. Lucia, St. Vincent & the Grenadines,
Grenada, Barbados, the Cayman Islands and Turks & Caicos) in breach of applicable statutory and contractual
obligations concerning interconnection. A similar allegation was made against TSTT. In addition, it was alleged
that Cable and Wireless plc and its four subsidiaries (but not TSTT) conspired to cause delay to Digicel.

The Directors of Cable & Wireless Communications believe the claim is without foundation and it has been
vigorously defended in the English High Court. Although, based on legal advice, the Directors of Cable & Wireless
Communications expect to defend this claim successfully, the Cable & Wireless Communications directors cannot
predict the outcome of this legal proceeding. An adverse ruling could lead to the payment of damages. At this time,
it is not possible to estimate potential exposure in the event of an adverse ruling, as the English High Court is
considering only liability and not damage claims. However, as the directors of Cable & Wireless Communications
expect to successfully defend this claim, they do not expect material damages to be awarded.

Trial in the English High Court began in May 2009 and closed in November 2009 and the Group is currently
awaiting judgment.

**42. Subsidiaries and joint ventures**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group comprises a large number of companies and it is not practical to
include all of them in this list. The list therefore only includes those companies whose results or financial
position, in the opinion of the Directors, principally affects the figures shown in the financial statements.

**1** The Cable & Wireless Communications Group regards this company as a subsidiary because it controls the majority of the Board of Directors through a shareholders’ agreement.

**2** This company has a financial year end of 31 December.

**3** From October 2009, this entity is a subsidiary (formerly a joint venture).

**4** This company is audited by a firm other than KPMG and its international member firms.

**5** The Cable & Wireless Communications Group holds an economic interest of 55% in Monaco Telecom SAM via a contractual arrangement.

F-64


-----

On 18 June 2004 the Cable & Wireless Communications Group acquired 55% of Monaco Telecom, a Monaco
based telecommunications service provider, from Vivendi Universal. Simultaneously with the acquisition, the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group transferred legal ownership of 6% of the shares of Monaco Telecom
to an unrelated third-party. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group contractually retained voting and
economic rights in the shares as part of the arrangement. In addition, the 6% interest is subject to certain put and
call options that, together with the retained voting and economic rights, provide full management control of
Monaco Telecom to the Cable & Wireless Communications Group.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group has also entered into a shareholders’ agreement with the
Principality of Monaco, which contains, among other provisions, a prohibition on either the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group or the Principality (subject to certain limited exceptions) selling their shares in Monaco
Telecom for five years, mutual pre-emption rights on transfer of shares and certain other limited rights in favour
of the Principality. The Principality has a put option entitling it to put its 45% shareholding in Monaco Telecom
to the Cable & Wireless Communications Group at certain times after 1 January 2008. The exercise price under
the put option is fair market value, taking into account the nature of the minority stake in Monaco Telecom.

**43. Financial risk management**

**_Treasury policy_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk
(including currency risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s overall risk management programme seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s financial performance.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s treasury operations are managed on the basis of policies and
authorities approved by the Cable and Wireless plc Board. These policies will be adopted by the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group in substantially the same form post-Demerger. Day to day management of
treasury activities is delegated to Treasury, within specified financial limits for each type of transaction and
counterparty.

To the extent that subsidiaries undertake treasury transactions, these are governed by Cable & Wireless
Communications Group policies and delegated authorities. Material subsidiary positions are monitored by
Treasury. Where appropriate, transactions are reported to the Board. All subsidiaries are required to report details
of their cash and debt positions to Treasury on a monthly basis.

The key responsibilities of Treasury include funding, investment of surplus cash and the management of interest
rate and foreign currency risk. The majority of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s cash resources
and borrowings are managed centrally by Treasury.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group may use derivatives including forward foreign exchange
contracts, interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps and options, where appropriate, in the management of its
foreign currency and interest rate exposures. The use of these instruments is in accordance with strategies agreed
from time to time by Treasury and subject to policies approved by the Cable & Wireless Communications Group
Board. Derivatives are not used for trading or speculative purposes and derivative transactions and positions are
monitored and reported by Treasury on a regular basis and are subject to policies adopted by the Board.

**_Exchange rate risk_**

When the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group was part of the Cable & Wireless Group, the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s transactions were reported in sterling and all non-sterling cash flows were subject to
foreign exchange risk. As a result, at 31 March 2009, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group had in place
forward exchange contracts to sell US$225 million (2007/08 – US$50 million hedging US dollar exposures). The
Cable & Wireless Communications Group did not apply hedge accounting to these contracts and as such they
were revalued to fair value through the income statement.

From Demerger, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group will report in US dollars, as this is the
predominant transaction currency of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group trades in many countries and a proportion of its revenue is
generated in currencies other than US dollars (the dominant functional currency of the Cable & Wireless

F-65


-----

Communications Group entities), notably the euro, sterling and Jamaican dollar. The Cable & Wireless
Communications Group is exposed to movements in exchange rates in relation to non-US dollar currency
payments, dividend income from foreign subsidiaries, reported profits of foreign subsidiaries and the net asset
carrying value of non-US dollar investments. Exchange risk is managed centrally by the Central operations on a
matching cash flow basis including forecast foreign currency cash repatriation inflows from subsidiaries and
forecast foreign currency payments.

Where appropriate the Cable & Wireless Communications Group manages its exposure to movements in
exchange rates on a net basis and uses forward foreign exchange contracts and other derivative and financial
instruments to reduce the exposures created where currencies do not naturally offset in the short term. The Cable
& Wireless Communications Group will undertake hedges to minimise the exposure to individual transactions
that create significant foreign exchange exposures for the Cable & Wireless Communications Group where
appropriate. Where cost-effective and possible, foreign subsidiaries are financed in their domestic currency to
minimise the impact of translation of foreign currency denominated borrowings.

The reported profits of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group are translated at average rates of exchange
prevailing during the year. Overseas earnings are predominantly in US dollars or currencies linked to the US dollar.
In broad terms, based on the 2008/09 mix of profits, the impact of a unilateral 10% weakening of the US dollar
would have been to increase operating profit before exceptional items by approximately US$16 million and increase
total equity by US$33 million. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group had approximately US$319 million
of net financial liabilities denominated in US dollar or US dollar linked currencies at the end of the year.

As part of the overall policy of managing the exposure arising from foreign exchange movements relating to the
net carrying value of overseas investments, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group may, from time to
time, elect to match certain foreign currency liabilities against the carrying value of foreign investments.

**_Interest rate risk_**

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group is exposed to movements in interest rates on its surplus cash
balances and variable rate loans although there is a degree of offset between the two. Treasury may seek to
reduce volatility by fixing a proportion of this interest rate exposure whilst taking account of prevailing market
conditions as appropriate. There were no interest rate derivatives in place during any of the historical period
presented.

At 31 March 2009 55% of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s borrowings were at a fixed rate. A
reduction in interest rates would have an unfavourable impact upon the fair value of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s fixed rate borrowings. However, no debt is held for trading purposes and it is intended
that it will be kept in place until maturity. As a result, there is no exposure to fair value loss on fixed rate debt
and, as such, it has not been modelled.

A one percentage point increase in interest rates will have a US$4 million impact on the income received from
the surplus cash balances of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group and a US$5 million impact on the
floating rate borrowings of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group. The impact on equity is limited to the
impact on the income statement.

**_Credit risk_**

Cash deposits and similar financial instruments give rise to credit risk, which represents the loss that would be
recognised if a counterparty failed to perform as contracted. Management seeks to reduce this risk by ensuring
the counterparties to all but a small proportion of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s financial
instruments are the core relationship banks, which are rated A1 short-term and/or AA—long-term (or better) by
Standard & Poor’s (or equivalent by Moody’s and/or Fitch). The credit rating of these counterparties is
monitored on a continuing basis.

The types of instrument used for investment of funds are prescribed in Cable & Wireless Communications Group
treasury policies approved by the Cable and Wireless plc Board. These policies contain limits on exposure for the
Group as a whole to any one counterparty of approximately US$100 million.

Credit risk on receivables is discussed in note 22.

F-66


-----

**_Liquidity risk_**

At 31 March 2009, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group had cash and cash equivalents of US$581
million. These amounts are highly liquid and are a significant component of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s overall liquidity and capital resources. An analysis of the maturity of the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group’s financial instruments is contained in notes 20, 22 and 26 to 28.

Liquidity forecasts are produced on a regular basis to ensure the utilisation of current facilities is optimised, to
ensure covenant compliance and that medium-term liquidity is maintained and for the purpose of identifying
long-term strategic funding requirements. The Directors also regularly assess the balance of capital and debt
funding of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group.

Approximately 73% of Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s cash is invested in short-term bank deposits.
During 2006/07 the Cable & Wireless Communications Group sold at par £40 million (US$75 million) of credit
linked notes issued by AA-rated banks and referenced to the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s
US$290 million (£200 million) bond, which matures in 2012.

Certain foreign subsidiaries operate in jurisdictions which may restrict the ability to repatriate cash to the Cable
& Wireless Communications Group from time to time. Where restrictions are severe, local cash balances are
excluded from cash and cash equivalents.

**44. Post balance sheet events**

**_Further acquisition of interest in Dhiraagu_**

During October 2009, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group purchased a further 7% of the share capital
of Dhiraagu from the Maldives government for cash consideration of US$40 million. This transaction will result
in the Cable & Wireless Communications Group reclassifying its joint venture investment in this entity to a
subsidiary investment.

**Notes:**
Restricted Shares (in the case of Sir Richard Lapthorne) means restricted share awards that have been granted pursuant to the IP 2001.

Performance Shares means performance share awards that have been granted pursuant to the IP 2001.

Restricted Shares (in the case of Tim Pennington and Nick Cooper) means the restricted share awards that have been granted pursuant to the RSP 2005.

DS Dividend Shares

MDS Matching Dividend Shares

MS Matching Shares

**1** Full vesting of the restricted shares only occurs if the TSR performance of the Company is in the top 10% when compared with the FTSE GTSI, on a straight line scale. No shares vest
for TSR at or below the mid-point of the comparator group of companies.

**2** Full vesting of the performance shares, and any associated dividend reinvestment shares, only occurs if the TSR performance of the Company meets or exceeds the upper quartile when
compared against the FTSE GTSI during the performance period. Where TSR meets the median, 33.33% of the performance shares vest and a sliding scale operates between median
and upper quartile. No performance shares vest for TSR performance below the median.

**3** DSTIP matching shares are based on one matching share for two purchased shares for median TSR performance, rising to two matching shares for one purchased share for performance
at upper quartile or above. No matching shares are awarded for below median performance. A dividend award supplement also operates on the plan. Dividends that would have been
paid on purchased shares and the actual award of matching shares during the performance period are reinvested in additional shares.

**4** Subject to the Director remaining an employee of the Cable & Wireless Group and retaining beneficial ownership of the shares purchased as per below, the shares under award will be
delivered to the Director at the third anniversary of grant:

      - George Battersby purchased 275,000 ordinary shares on 30 March 2006.

      - Tony Rice purchased 1,000,000 ordinary shares on 30 March 2006.

Performance conditions apply to these shares and vesting will only occur if the TSR performance of the Company meets or exceeds the upper quartile measured against the constituents
of the FTSE GTSI.

**5** George Battersby and Tony Rice agreed to delay the date on which options were to become first exercisable from March 2009 to 21 May 2009. This was to avoid options becoming
exercisable during a prohibited period.

**6** One half of Tim Pennington’s Restricted Shares will vest on 30 September 2009 with the remaining half vesting on 30 September 2011.

**7** Full vesting of the award will only occur if the TSR performance of the Company exceeds the median TSR of the FTSE GTSI by 12% compound or more per annum. Where TSR
performance meets the median, one third of the award will vest.

**8** Subject to Tony Rice remaining an employee of the Company and retaining beneficial ownership until 29 March 2009, the Company will deliver these restricted shares to him.

Further detail on exceptional items is set out in note 7

As explained in note 2.1, certain administrative costs, interest, tax and pension amounts of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group reflect the management and capital structure of the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group prior to Demerger. Accordingly these amounts, together with the respective earnings per share figures,
may not be comparable with actual amounts that would have occurred had the Demerger been in effect during the
periods presented.

**Notes to the condensed financial statements**

**1. General information**

Cable & Wireless Communications Group is an international telecommunications group offering mobile,
broadband and domestic and international fixed line services to residential and business customers in 38
countries. It has four major operations being the Caribbean, Panama, Macau and Monaco & Islands.

**2. Summary of significant accounting policies**

2.1 Basis of preparation

The historical financial information represents the financial record for the two six month periods ended
30 September 2009 and 30 September 2008 and of those businesses that will be held by the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group at the date of admission of the shares of Cable & Wireless Communications to the
London Stock Exchange. Following the Demerger, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group will comprise
Cable & Wireless Communications and the entities forming the Cable & Wireless Group other than those entities
comprising the demerged Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group. The principal entities, including associated
undertakings and joint ventures, included within the historical financial information are set out in note 42 of the
historical financial information for the three years ended 31 March 2009.

The financial record is based on historical financial information extracted from the consolidation schedules
which supported the unaudited interim statements of the Cable & Wireless Group for the six months ended
30 September 2009.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group has not in the past formed a separate legal group and
therefore it is not meaningful to show share capital or an analysis of reserves for the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group. The net assets of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group are represented by
the cumulative investment in the Cable & Wireless Communications Group companies (shown as “invested
capital”).

_Application of IFRS_

The historical financial information has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial
_Reporting as adopted by the European Union except as described below. The historical financial information_
has also been prepared in accordance with applicable listing rules and requirements of the Prospectus
Directive (including the regulation regarding issuers with complex financial histories).

IFRS does not provide for the preparation of extracted financial information. Accordingly, the historical
financial information in this document has been prepared using certain commonly used accounting
conventions (as described in the Annexure to SIR 2000 (Investment Reporting Standard applicable to public
reporting engagements on historical financial information) issued by the UK Auditing Practices Board). The
application of these conventions results in the following material departures from IFRS as adopted by the
European Union. In all other respects, IFRS as adopted by the European Union have been applied.

_Carved out and combined financial information_

The historical financial information combines only the financial information for those businesses that will
be held by the Cable & Wireless Communications Group and therefore excludes financial information for
those subsidiaries of the Cable & Wireless Group that will form the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group.
Such excluded Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group subsidiaries, were, however, subsidiaries of entities
within the Cable & Wireless Communications Group during the six months ended 30 September 2009. Such
an approach differs from the consolidation requirements of IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial
_Statements which requires consolidation of all subsidiaries._

_Non-trading balances with the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group_

On Demerger, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group will not be required to repay non-trading balances with
the Cable & Wireless Communications Group. For this reason, these amounts have been deducted from the Cable
& Wireless Communications Group’s invested capital, rather than being treated as assets as required by IFRS.

_Earnings per share_

The weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding used to calculate earnings per share is based
on the number of shares expected on listing of Cable & Wireless Communications. The shares expected on

F-77


-----

listing of Cable & Wireless Communications will be equal to the outstanding shares of Cable and Wireless
plc prior to the scheme of arrangement. Therefore, these shares are considered to be the most appropriate
denominator on which to compute earnings per share for the Cable & Wireless Communications Group.

As a result of the above matters, no statement of compliance with IFRS can be included in respect of the
historical financial information.

_Other principles applied_

In addition, the following principles have been applied in preparing the historical financial information.

 - There has been no allocation of the corporate head office costs of the Cable & Wireless Group to the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group. This is because any allocation would be arbitrary in nature and
may not reflect properly the costs relating to functions such as financial reporting and treasury and
board costs as would have been incurred by that business. Therefore, the costs of the corporate head
office in Cable & Wireless Communications Group represent 100% of the corporate head office costs
of the Cable & Wireless Group. These costs are not representative of the level of historical head office
costs of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s business or of the costs that may be required
in the future.

 - The historical financial information is presented in US dollars (US$) and rounded to the nearest
million. Until 1 April 2007, the financial information in respect of those businesses included within the
historical accounts of Cable and Wireless plc has been presented in pounds sterling (£) as this was the
dominant functional currency of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group entities when the Cable
& Wireless Communications Group included other Cable & Wireless Group companies. However, as a
result of the Demerger of those entities, the dominant functional currency of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group entities has been determined to be US dollars as this is the primary currency in
which the exchange transactions of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group are priced.
Accordingly, the historical financial information has been presented as though US dollars was the
presentation currency throughout the period. The key exchange rates between sterling and US dollars
used were:


**30 September**
**2008**


**US$ : £**


**30 September**
**2009**


Average . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.5707 1.9613
Period end . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.5945 1.8471

- Trading balances with the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group are presented within receivables and
payables as though they were with an external party.

- The main UK defined benefit scheme operated by the Cable & Wireless Group provides benefits to
current and past employees of, and therefore represents obligations of both the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group. For the period since 1 April
2006, the two Groups have each borne a proportion of the service costs of this scheme based on the
approximate split of active membership. The scheme’s expected return on assets and interest expense
have been apportioned between the two Groups based on the directors’ assumptions about the
underlying liabilities, being 20% Cable & Wireless Communications Group and 80% Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group. The assets, liabilities, actuarial gains and losses and cash flows relating to the
scheme have been apportioned based on 20% Cable & Wireless Communications Group and 80%
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group.

Detailed disclosures relating to this scheme are provided in note 32 of the historical financial
information for the three years ended 31 March 2009.

On Demerger and as agreed with the scheme trustees, the liabilities of the main UK defined benefit
scheme will be allocated approximately equally between the Cable & Wireless Communications Group
and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group.

Management believes presenting the historical financial information according to the historical
allocation better represents the underlying pension cost of the two Groups in the periods presented.

If the historical financial information (which has been prepared on the basis of a split 20% Cable &
Wireless Communications Group and 80% Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group) had been prepared on

F-78


-----

the basis of the actual split of liabilities to be applied post-Demerger (i.e. a split of 50% Cable &
Wireless Communications Group and 50% Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group), the impact on the
relevant financial statements of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group would have been as
follows:

 - Tax charges in the historical financial information have been determined based on the tax charges
recorded by the Cable & Wireless Communications Group companies in their local statutory accounts
as well as certain adjustments relating to those entities made for Cable & Wireless Group consolidation
purposes. The tax charges recorded in the historical income statement have been affected by the tax
arrangements within the Cable & Wireless Group and are not necessarily representative of the tax
charges that would have been reported had the Cable & Wireless Communications Group been an
independent group. They are not necessarily representative of the tax charges that may arise in the
future.

This historical financial information has been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain
financial instruments held at fair value. Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale are stated at the
lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. The preparation of the historical financial
information in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions
that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. These
estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are
considered to be reasonable under the circumstances. They form the basis of judgements about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual outcomes may differ
from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on a continuing basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
Critical judgements and areas where the use of estimates is significant are discussed in note 3.

The accounting policies used in the historical financial information have been applied consistently by Cable
& Wireless Communications Group entities.

address how an entity should account for some
share-based payments in its own financial
statements if its parent or another entity in the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group will pay
for goods or services that it has received. These
amendments will not have a material impact on the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group.


The historical financial information has been prepared on the basis that the companies that will form the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group were a group for consolidation purposes during the periods
covered by the financial information and includes the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s share of
the results and net assets of its joint ventures and associates. The accounts of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s main trading subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates have been prepared to
align with the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s reporting date.

F-81


-----

(a) _Subsidiaries_

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by and forming part of the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group. Control exists when the Cable & Wireless Communications Group has the power to govern the
financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing
control, the existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable are considered.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which the Cable & Wireless Communications Group
effectively takes control until the date that control ceases. Accounting policies of subsidiaries are
aligned with the policies adopted by the Cable & Wireless Communications Group to ensure
consistency.

The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, liabilities incurred or
assumed and equity instruments issued at the date of exchange plus costs directly attributable to the
acquisition. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s share of the identifiable net assets and contingent liabilities acquired is
recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the
subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.

Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Cable & Wireless
Communications Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the
transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.

_(b)_ _Joint ventures and associates_

Investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting
and are initially recognised at cost. Joint ventures are entities over which the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group exercises joint control. Associates are entities over which the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group has significant influence but not control over the financial and
operating policies. This generally accompanies a shareholding of between 20% and 50% The Cable &
Wireless Communications Group’s investment in joint ventures and associates includes goodwill (net
of any accumulated impairment loss) identified on acquisition. Accounting policies of joint ventures
and associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by
the Cable & Wireless Communications Group.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s share of its joint ventures’ and associates’ postacquisition profits or losses is recognised in the income statement. Its share of post-acquisition
movements in reserves is recognised in invested capital. The cumulative post-acquisition movements
are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment.

When the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s share of losses in a joint venture or associate
exceeds its investment (including any other unsecured long-term receivables), the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group does not recognise further losses unless it has incurred obligations or made
payments on behalf of the investee.

Unrealised gains on transactions between the Cable & Wireless Communications Group and its joint
ventures and associates are eliminated to the extent of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s
investment.

2.4 Segmental reporting

Cable & Wireless Communications Group is an international telecommunications service provider. It
operates integrated telecommunications companies in 38 countries offering mobile, broadband and domestic
and international fixed line services to residential and business customers. It has four principal operations
being the Caribbean, Panama, Macau and Monaco & Islands.

IFRS 8 Segmental Reporting requires disclosures in respect of the operating segments of the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group according to the ‘management approach’. This approach reflects the type
and extent of information presented to the Cable & Wireless Communications Group Board.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group Board considers the performance of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s four principal operations in the Caribbean, Panama, Macau and Monaco &
Islands in assessing the performance of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group and making decisions
about the allocation of resources. Accordingly, these are the operating segments disclosed. The operating
segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group Board.

F-82


-----

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group also operates the Central operations, a small central function
which acts as a portfolio manager. The Central operations are not considered to be an operating segment as
it does not earn revenue from its activities. The results of the Central operations are reported in the other and
eliminations column.

2.5 Foreign currency translation

(a) _Functional currency_

Items included in the financial statements of each of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s
entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity
operates (the functional currency).

(b) _Foreign currency translation_

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency of each entity using the
exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting
from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.

(c) _Foreign operations_

The results and financial position of all the Cable & Wireless Communications Group entities that have
a functional currency different from the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s presentation
currency of US dollars are translated as follows:

(i) assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the reporting date;

(ii) income and expenses are translated at rates closely approximating the rate at the date of the
transactions; and

(iii) resulting exchange differences are recognised in invested capital.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets
and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.

On disposal of a foreign entity, accumulated exchange differences are recognised in the income
statement in the same period in which the gain or loss on disposal is recognised.

Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities are taken to
invested capital. Where investments are matched in whole or in part by foreign currency loans, the
exchange differences arising on the retranslation of such loans are also recorded as movements in the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s invested capital.

There are no Cable & Wireless Communications Group entities operating in a hyperinflationary economy.

2.6 Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment
losses. The cost of property, plant and equipment includes labour and overhead costs arising directly from
the construction or acquisition of an item of property, plant and equipment.

The estimated costs of dismantling and removing an asset and restoring the site on which it is located are
included in the cost of property, plant and equipment. The corresponding obligation is recognised as a
provision in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.

Subsequent costs are included in an asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other
subsequent costs (primarily repairs and maintenance) are charged to the income statement during the
financial period in which they are incurred.

Interest costs relating to borrowings made to finance separately identifiable major capital projects (those that
take six months or more to complete) are capitalised as part of the cost of assets when it is probable that
they will result in future economic benefits to the entity and the costs can be measured reliably. Any interest
costs included are only those that are incurred up to the time that those projects are ready for service.

F-83


-----

Depreciation is not recognised on freehold land or assets under construction. On other property, plant and
equipment, depreciation is recognised on the difference between the cost of an item and its estimated
residual value, on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

**Lives**

Cables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . up to 20 years

Leasehold buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . up to 40 years or term of lease if less

Asset residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date. An
asset’s carrying amount is written down to its recoverable amount if the carrying amount is greater than its
recoverable amount through sale or use.

Gains and losses on the sale of property, plant and equipment are determined by reference to the proceeds
and net book values. These gains and losses are recognised in the income statement.

Engineering spares held for use by the Cable & Wireless Communications Group over a period exceeding
one year are included in assets under construction. They are stated at cost and include an appropriate
allocation of labour and overheads. The cost is determined on a weighted average basis. Provision is made
for deterioration and obsolescence.

2.7 Intangible assets

(a) _Goodwill_

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s share of the identifiable net assets and contingent liabilities of the acquired
subsidiary, joint venture or associate. It is not amortised. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is
included in intangible assets. Goodwill on acquisitions of joint ventures and associates is included in
the carrying value of those investments. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost
less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of
impairment testing.

(b) _Other intangible assets_

Costs that are directly associated with the purchase and implementation of identifiable and unique
software products by the Cable & Wireless Communications Group are recognised as intangible assets.
Expenditures that enhance and extend the benefits of computer software programs beyond their original
specifications and lives are recognised as a capital improvement and added to the original cost of the
software.

Expenditure is only capitalised if costs can be measured reliably, the product is technically and
commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable and the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group has sufficient resources to complete development and to use the asset.

Intangible assets relating to licences and customer contracts have been obtained as part of the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group’s business combinations. They are recorded initially at their fair
values at the date of acquisition.

Other intangible assets are amortised over their respective lives which are usually based on contractual
terms.

Other intangible assets are stated at cost less amortisation on a straight-line basis over the following
periods:

**Lives**

Licences . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25 years or less if the licence term is shorter

2.8 Financial assets and liabilities

_Financial assets_

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories:
financial assets at fair value through the income statement, receivables, held-to-maturity investments and
available-for-sale financial assets. The classification depends on the purpose for which the assets are held.
The Cable & Wireless Communications Group currently does not classify any assets as held-to-maturity
investments. The basis of determining fair values is set out in note 2.9.

Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition in accordance with IAS
39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and re-evaluates this designation at every
reporting date for financial assets other than those held at fair value through the income statement.

_Financial assets at fair value through the income statement_

This category has two sub-categories: financial assets held for trading and those designated at fair value
through the income statement at inception. A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired
principally for the purpose of selling in the short-term or if so designated by management. Derivatives are
also categorised as held for trading. Assets classified as financial assets at fair value through the income
statement are presented as current assets if they are either held for trading or are expected to be realised
within one year of the reporting date.

_Available-for-sale financial assets_

Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated in this
category at inception or not classified in any of the other categories. They are included in non-current assets
unless management intends to dispose of the asset within 12 months of the reporting date. Purchases and
sales of assets are recognised on the trade-date (the date on which the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group commits to purchase or sell the asset).

_Receivables_

Receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in
an active market. They arise when the Cable & Wireless Communications Group provides money, goods or
services directly to a third-party with no intention of trading the receivable. Receivables are included in
current assets, except for those with maturities greater than one year after the reporting date (where they are
classified as non-current assets). Receivables are included in trade and other receivables in the statement of
financial position.

Receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. Amortised
cost is determined using the effective interest method less an allowance for impairment if necessary. An
allowance for impairment of receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms
of the receivables. The amount of the allowance is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and
the present value of estimated future cash flows (discounted at the effective interest rate). The allowance is
initially recognised in the income statement.

_Recognition and measurement_

Financial assets at fair value through the income statement are recognised and subsequently carried at fair
value. Available-for-sale financial assets are recognised and subsequently carried at fair value plus any
directly attributable transaction costs. Receivables and held-to-maturity investments are carried at amortised
cost using the effective interest method. Financial assets not carried at fair value through the income
statement are initially recognised at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs.

Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the assets have expired or have
been transferred and the Cable & Wireless Communications Group has transferred substantially all risks and
rewards of ownership. Gains and losses (both realised and unrealised) arising from changes in the value of
financial assets held at fair value through the income statement are included in the income statement in the
period in which they arise.

Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of non-monetary securities classified as
available-for-sale are recognised in invested capital. When securities classified as available-for-sale are sold
or impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments are included in the income statement.

F-85


-----

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective
evidence that a financial asset or a Cable & Wireless Communications Group of financial assets is impaired.
In the case of equity securities classified as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair
value of the security below its cost is considered in determining whether it is impaired. If any such evidence
exists for available-for-sale financial assets the cumulative loss is removed from invested capital and
recognised in the income statement. This loss is measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and
the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the income
statement. Impairment losses recognised on these instruments are not reversed through the income statement
if the fair value of the security increases in a later period.

_Derivative financial instruments_

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are
subsequently re-measured at their fair value at each reporting date. The method of recognising the resulting
gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of
the item being hedged. Gains and losses on derivative instruments that are not designated as hedge
instruments are recognised immediately in the income statement.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group only hedges net investments in foreign operations. The
Cable & Wireless Communications Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship
between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for
undertaking various hedge transactions. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group also documents its
assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in
hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values of cash flows of hedged items.

Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges by
recognising any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge in
equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income
statement.

_Financial liabilities_

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group classifies its financial liabilities into the following
categories: loans and puttable instruments. The classification depends on the terms of the liability, as
described below.

Management determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition in accordance with
IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and re-evaluates this designation at every
reporting date.

_Loans_

Loans are recognised initially at fair value net of directly attributable transaction costs incurred. Loans are
subsequently measured at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and
the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the loans using the effective
interest method.

Convertible bonds issued by the Cable & Wireless Communications Group were initially recognised at fair
value. The bond was separated into liability and equity components. The liability component was recognised
at amortised cost. The equity component represented the residual of the fair value of the bond less the
liability component. The liability component was subsequently measured on an amortised cost basis.

Loans are classified as current liabilities unless the Cable & Wireless Communications Group has an
unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date (where
they are classified as non-current assets).

_Puttable instruments_

Puttable instruments on non-controlling interests issued as part of a business combination are accounted for
by the Cable & Wireless Communications Group as a financial liability. The liability is based on the present
value of the redemption amount as if the puttable instrument had been exercised at the reporting date.
Movements in the value of the liability together with dividends paid to minority interests are recognised as
adjustments to goodwill with the unwind of the discount on the fair value calculation being recognised in the
income statement.

F-86


-----

2.9 Fair value estimation for financial instruments

The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such as publicly traded derivatives or
trading and available-for-sale securities) is based on quoted market prices at the reporting date. The quoted
market price used for traded financial assets held by the Cable & Wireless Communications Group is the
current bid price. The appropriate quoted market price for traded financial liabilities is the current offer
price. The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange market
rates at the reporting date.

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using
valuation techniques. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group uses a variety of methods which
include the use of recent arm’s length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the
same, discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models which reflect the specific instrument.

The nominal value of receivables (less estimated valuation allowances) and payables are assumed to
approximate their fair values. The fair value of financial liabilities measured at amortised cost for disclosure
purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that
is available to the Cable & Wireless Communications Group for similar financial instruments. Discounted
cash flows are used to determine the fair value for the majority of remaining financial instruments.

2.10 Impairment of assets (excluding financial instruments)

Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for
impairment. All other non-current assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. For the purposes of assessing
impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows
(cash generating units).

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group determines any impairment by comparing the carrying
values of each of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s assets (or cash generating units to which it
belongs) to their recoverable amounts which is the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its
value in use. Fair value represents market value in an active market. Value in use is determined by
discounting future cash flows arising from the asset. Future cash flows are determined with reference to the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s own projections using pre-tax discount rates which represent
the estimated weighted average cost of capital for the business. The approach, assumptions and results of the
impairment test are set out in note 17 of the historical financial information for the three years ended
31 March 2009.

Impairment reviews involve management making assumptions and estimates, which are highly judgmental
and susceptible to change.

2.11 Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is the price paid less any rebates,
trade discounts or subsidies. It also includes delivery charges and import duties, but does not include value
added taxes or advertising and administration costs. Cost is based on the first-in, first- out (FIFO) principle.
For inventories held for resale, net realisable value is determined as the estimated selling price in the
ordinary course of business less costs to sell. For materials and consumables, provision is made for obsolete
and slow moving inventories as required.

2.12 Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and at bank, short-term deposits, money market funds and
government securities. They are highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of
cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Cash and cash equivalents are carried
in the statement of financial position at cost. Bank overdrafts are included within loans in current liabilities
on the statement of financial position.

2.13 Invested capital

Invested capital is the cumulative investment in the Cable & Wireless Communications Group, and is
treated akin to equity in the historical financial information. It includes share capital and all other reserves
that were in existence prior to the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s demerger from the Cable &

F-87


-----

Wireless Group, as well as capital contributions to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group. On Demerger,
it is expected that there will be no contractual obligation for the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group to
repay these amounts and hence they have been treated as deductions from invested capital. These amounts
are recorded at cost. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or standalone options
are recognised in invested capital as a deduction from the issue proceeds. Incremental costs directly
attributable to the issue of new shares or options for the acquisition of a business are included in the cost of
acquisition.

2.14 Leases

Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Cable & Wireless Communications Group has
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are
capitalised at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset or the present value
of minimum lease payments. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as
to achieve a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The
corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in loans and obligations under finance
leases. These payments are split between capital and interest elements using the annuity method. The
property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases is depreciated over the shorter of the useful life
of the asset or the lease term.

Leases comprising a lease of land and a lease of buildings within a single contract are split into the two
component parts. The component part for buildings is then tested to determine whether the lease is a finance
or operating lease and treated accordingly.

Leases of land and all other leases are classified as operating leases and are not recognised in the statement
of financial position. Payments made under operating leases, net of lease incentives or premiums received,
are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.

2.15 Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale

When the value of non-current assets is expected to be recovered principally through sale rather than
through continuing use, they are classified as non-current assets held for sale. With the exception of deferred
tax assets, assets arising from employee benefits and financial instruments, these assets are classified as
current and are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.

Disposal groups are groups of assets and liabilities to be disposed of together as a group in a single
transaction. They are recognised as held for sale at the reporting date and are separately disclosed as current
assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position.

Measurement differences arising between the carrying amount and fair value less cost of disposal are treated
as impairment charges and separately disclosed.

2.16 Employee benefits

_Defined contribution pensions_

A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Cable & Wireless Communications Group
pays fixed contributions to a third-party. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group pays contributions
to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.
The Cable & Wireless Communications Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions
have been paid. The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future
payments is available.

_Defined benefit obligations_

A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will
receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and
compensation. These schemes are generally funded through payments to insurance companies or trusteeadministered funds, determined by periodic actuarial calculations.

The asset (or liability) recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of each defined benefit
pension plan represents the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligations

F-88


-----

and any asset ceiling adjustments at the reporting date. Defined benefit obligations for each scheme are
calculated semi-annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value
of these obligations is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of
high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid. The
bonds used will have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group recognises actuarial gains and losses, arising from
experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions, in the period in which they occur in the
statement of comprehensive income. Past service costs are recognised immediately in income, unless the
changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of
time (the vesting period). In these cases, the past service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the
vesting period.

Current service costs and any past service costs, together with the unwinding of the discount on plan
liabilities less the expected return on plan assets, are included within operating costs.

The IAS 19 surplus or deficit of defined benefits funds is adjusted to reflect future economic benefits
available in the form of a cash refund or a reduction in future contributions, allowing for maximum funding
contributions in accordance with IFRIC 14. Any adjustment to the surplus is recorded directly in invested
capital.

_Other post-employment obligations_

Some Cable & Wireless Communications Group companies provide post-retirement healthcare benefits to
their retirees. The entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional on the employee remaining in service
up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits
are accrued over the period of employment using an accounting methodology similar to that for defined
benefit pension plans. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments, and changes in
actuarial assumptions, are dealt with in the same way as for defined benefit pension schemes. Independent
qualified actuaries value these obligations annually. Current service costs are charged to the income
statement.

_Share-based compensation_

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group operates various equity-settled, share-based compensation
plans. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised
as an expense over the vesting period. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is
determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, which excludes the impact of any
non-market vesting conditions (for example, service, profitability and sales growth targets). Non-market
vesting conditions are included in estimates about the number of options that are expected to vest. At each
reporting date, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group revises its estimates of the number of options
that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision of original non-market estimates, if any, in
the income statement, and a corresponding adjustment to invested capital over the remaining vesting period.

The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to invested capital when
the options are exercised.

_Termination benefits_

Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated before the normal retirement date or
whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Cable & Wireless
Communications Group recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to the action
leading to the employee’s termination. Termination benefits falling due more than a year after the reporting
date are discounted to present value.

_Bonus plans_

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group recognises a liability where contractually obliged or where
there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.

_The Cable and Wireless Long Term Incentive Plan_

Cable and Wireless plc operates the LTIP. The plan rewards executive directors of Cable and Wireless plc
responsible for, and certain senior employees in, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group. The

F-89


-----

plan is accounted for as an ‘other long term employee benefit’ in accordance with IAS 19. The amount
recognised as a liability represents the estimated present value of the obligation at the reporting date.

The LTIP creates a reward pool over a five year period from 1 April 2006 (or until a vesting event, if
earlier) depending on the extent to which the business has grown in value from its base valuation at the start
of the period (this period was changed from four to five years in July 2009).

Base valuations are adjusted over the performance period i) to reflect additional capital notionally treated as
borrowed by the business ii) to reflect capital notionally treated as returned by the business and iii)
increased by the notional weighted average cost of capital of the business (which will be at least 8% per
annum compounded). If the business’ value is lower than its adjusted base valuation at the end of the
performance period, there will be no reward pool. To the extent that the business’ value exceeds its adjusted
base valuation at the end of the performance period, 10% of the excess growth in value goes into the reward
pool.

Part of the reward pool was paid to participants up to the end of year three (April 2009), with a portion
payable (less payments made at end of year three) to participants at the end of year four (April 2010) and the
balance in full at the end of year five (April 2011). Measurement of the size of the reward pool is carried out
every six months to correspond with the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s accounting periods.
However, apart from awards held by participants who ceased employment as “good leavers” no awards
vested until the end of year three. In the event of a potential payment to an individual in excess of US$31
million, the deferral period would be extended until 31 March 2012 or for a period of up to one year
following a vesting event, if earlier.

2.17 Tax

Income tax expense in the interim period is based on the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s best
estimate of the weighted average annual income tax rate expected for the full financial year.

Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income
statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in invested capital, in which case it
is recognised in invested capital.

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using rates that have been enacted or
substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of prior years.

Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements, except
where the difference arises from:

   - the initial recognition of goodwill; or

   - the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination, affecting
neither accounting nor taxable profit.

Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the temporary
differences reverse, based on rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available
against which the temporary differences can be utilised.

Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates and
interests in joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled
by the Cable & Wireless Communications Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not
reverse in the foreseeable future.

2.18 Provisions

Provisions are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount. They are recognised when the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more
likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be
reliably estimated.

Provisions are presented in the statement of financial position at the present value of the estimated future
outflows expected to be required to settle the obligation. The discount rate is the pre-tax rate reflecting the
assessment of the settlement date. Provision charges and reversals are recognised in the income statement.
Discount unwinding is recognised as a finance expense.

F-90


-----

Provisions are recognised for unavoidable lease payments in onerous contracts as the difference between the
rentals due and any income expected to be derived from the vacant properties being sub-let. Redundancy
provisions, relating to both continuing and discontinued operations, comprise employee termination
payments. Legal provisions comprise legal fees and, where appropriate, expected settlement costs.

2.19 Revenue recognition

Cable & Wireless Communications Group revenue, which excludes discounts, value added tax and similar
sales taxes, represents the amount receivable in respect of services provided to customers. It includes sales
to joint ventures and associated companies but does not include sales by joint ventures and associated
companies or sales between Cable & Wireless Communications Group companies. Revenue is recognised
only when payment is probable.

Revenue from services is recognised as the services are provided. Revenue from service contracts that cover
periods of greater than 12 months is recognised in the income statement in proportion to the services
delivered at the reporting date. In respect of services invoiced in advance, amounts are deferred until
provision of the service.

Amounts payable by and to other telecommunications operators are recognised as the services are provided.
Charges are negotiated separately and are subject to continual review. Revenue generated through the
provision of these services is accounted for gross of any amounts payable to other telecommunications
operators for interconnect fees.

Mobile revenue comprises amounts charged to customers in respect of monthly access charges, airtime
usage, messaging, and the provision of other mobile telecommunications services. This includes data
services and information provision and revenue from the sale of equipment (including handsets).

Mobile monthly access charges are invoiced and recorded as part of a periodic billing cycle. Airtime, either
from contract customers as part of the invoiced amount or from prepaid customers through the sale of
prepaid cards, is recorded in the period in which the customer uses the service. Unbilled revenue resulting
from mobile services provided to contract customers from the billing cycle date to the end of each period is
accrued. Unearned monthly access charges relating to periods after each accounting period are deferred.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group earns revenue from the transmission of content and traffic on
its network originated by third-party providers. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group assesses
whether revenue should be recorded gross as principal or net as agent, based on the features of such
arrangements including the following indicators:

   - whether the Cable & Wireless Communications Group holds itself out as an agent;

   - establishment of the price;

   - provision of customer remedies;

   - performance of part of the service; and

   - assumption of credit risk.

Revenue from sales of telecommunications equipment is recognised upon delivery to the customer.

The total consideration on arrangements with multiple revenue generating activities (generally the sale of
telecom equipment and ongoing service) is allocated to those components that are separable based on the
estimated fair value of the components.

Revenue arising from the provision of other services, including maintenance contracts, is recognised evenly
over the periods in which the service is provided.

2.20 Dividend income

Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established. Dividend income is
included within finance income.

2.21 Interest income

Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest
rate applicable.

2.22 Exceptional items

Exceptional items are material items which derive from individual events that fall within the ordinary
activities of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group that are identified as exceptional items by virtue
of their size, nature or incidence. Further detail on exceptional items is set out in note 6 of the historical
financial information for the three years ended 31 March 2009 and in the relevant note for each item.

**3. Critical accounting estimates and judgements**

In the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, a number of estimates and assumptions have been
made relating to the performance and the financial position of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group.
Results may differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. The Directors
consider that the following discussion addresses the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s most critical
accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the presentation of its consolidated financial
performance and position. These particular policies require subjective and complex judgements, often as a result
of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are uncertain.

3.1 Valuation of assets for purchase accounting

Where the Cable & Wireless Communications Group undertakes business combinations, the cost of
acquisition is allocated to tangible and other identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired and
assumed by reference to their estimated fair values at the time of acquisition. The remaining amount is
recorded as goodwill. Any value assigned to the identifiable assets is determined by reference to an active
market, independent appraisal or estimate by management based on cash flow projections. The latter
situation includes estimates and judgements regarding expectations for the economic useful lives of the
products and technology acquired. In this situation, where appropriate, third-party valuation specialists are
involved.

3.2 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group assigns useful lives and residual values to property, plant
and equipment based on periodic studies of actual asset lives and the intended use for those assets. Changes
in circumstances such as technological advances, prospective economic utilisation and physical condition of
the assets concerned could result in the actual useful lives or residual values differing from initial estimates.
Where the Cable & Wireless Communications Group determines that the useful life of property, plant and
equipment should be shortened or residual value reduced, it depreciates the net carrying amount in excess of
the residual value over the revised remaining useful life, thereby increasing depreciation expense. Any
change in an asset’s life or residual value is reflected in the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s
financial statements when the change in estimate is determined.

3.3 Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets

The Directors assess the impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (excluding
goodwill) whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable or otherwise as required by accounting standards. Factors that are considered important and
which could trigger an impairment review include the following:

  - obsolescence or physical damage;

  - significant changes in technology and regulatory environments;

  - significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;

  - significant changes in the use of its assets or the strategy for its overall business;

  - significant negative industry or economic trends; and

  - significant decline in its share price for a sustained period and its market capitalisation relative to net
book value.

In addition, the Directors test goodwill at least annually for impairment.

The identification of impairment indicators, the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of the
recoverable amount for assets or cash generating units require significant judgement.

F-92


-----

3.4 Revenue recognition

Judgement is required in assessing the application of the principles of revenue recognition in respect of
Cable & Wireless Communications Group revenues. This includes presentation of revenue as principal or as
agent in respect of income received from transmission of content provided by third parties.

3.5 Receivables valuation

The valuation allowance for trade receivables reflects the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s
estimates of losses arising from the failure or inability of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s
customers to make required payments. The allowance is based on the ageing of customer accounts, customer
credit-worthiness and the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s historical write-off experience.
Changes to the allowance may be required if the financial condition of its customers improves or
deteriorates. An improvement in financial condition may result in lower actual write-offs. Historically,
changes to the estimate of losses have not been material to the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s
financial position and performance.

3.6 Customer and supplier commitments

The nature of the telecommunications industry is such that estimates are often required to be made in
relation to customer or supplier commitments, the final outcome of which may not be known for some time.
It uses estimates of price or usage to determine the revenue and expense recognised in any period. These
estimates are periodically adjusted to reflect actual pricing or usage as such information becomes available
or is agreed. As issues arise or are resolved, accruals are created or released as appropriate – the net impact
of this is included in operating profit within the relevant line item.

3.7 Interconnection with other operators

As part of the normal course of business, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group interconnects with
other telecommunications operators. In certain instances it uses estimates to determine the amount of
revenue receivable from or expense payable to these other operators. The prices at which these services are
charged are sometimes regulated and may be subject to retrospective adjustment. Estimates are used in
assessing the likely impact of these adjustments.

Adjustments to interconnect estimates are taken to operating profit in the period in which the adjustments
are made.

3.8 Taxation

The tax charge is the sum of the total current and deferred tax charges or credits. The calculation of the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s total tax charge involves a degree of estimation and judgement
in respect of certain items where the tax treatment cannot be finally determined until a resolution has been
reached with the relevant tax authority or, if necessary, through a formal legal process. The final resolution
of some of these items may give rise to material income statement and/or cash flow variances.

The resolution of issues is not always within the control of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group
and is often dependent on the efficiency of the administrative and legal processes in the relevant tax
jurisdictions in which the Cable & Wireless Communications Group operates. Issues can, and often do, take
many years to resolve. Payments in respect of tax liabilities for an accounting period result from payments
on account and on the final resolution of open items. As a result there can be substantial differences between
the tax charge in the income statement and tax payments.

3.9 Recognition of deferred tax assets

The recognition of deferred tax assets is based upon whether it is probable that sufficient and suitable
taxable profits will be available in the future, against which the reversal of temporary differences can be
deducted. Recognition therefore involves judgement regarding the future financial performance of the
particular legal entity or tax group in which the deferred tax asset has been recognised.

3.10 Provisions

A provision is recognised when there is a present (legal or constructive) obligation in respect of a past event
as explained in the accounting policy in note 2.18. Judgement is required to quantify such amounts.

F-93


-----

3.11 Pensions

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group provides several defined benefit pension schemes for its
employees. The asset (or liability) recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of defined
benefit pension plans represents the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit
obligations and asset ceiling adjustments at the reporting date. The expected cost of providing these defined
benefit pensions will depend on an assessment of such factors as:

   - the life expectancy of the members;

   - the length of service;

   - the rate of salary progression;

   - the rate of return earned on assets in the future;

   - the rate used to discount future pension liabilities; and

   - future inflation rates.

The assumptions used by the Cable & Wireless Communications Group are set out in note 32 of the
historical financial information for the three years ended 31 March 2009 and are estimates chosen from a
range of possible actuarial assumptions which may not necessarily be borne out in practice but are
comparable to the median estimates in this regard used by other FTSE 100 companies. Changes to these
assumptions could materially affect the size of the defined benefit schemes’ liabilities and assets disclosed
in note 32 of the historical financial information for the three years ended 31 March 2009.

3.12 Fair value estimation

The basis of determining fair values is set out in note 2.9. Where market values are not available, fair values
are based on valuation methodologies which require inputs and forecasts to be made. Judgement is required
in determining the appropriate assumptions underlying those inputs and forecasts.

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using
valuation techniques. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group uses a variety of methods and makes
assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each reporting date.

Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments are used for long-term loans. Other
techniques, such as estimated discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value for the remaining
financial instruments. The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward
exchange market rates at the reporting date.

The nominal value less valuation adjustments of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate
their fair values. The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the
future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group for similar financial instruments.

3.13 Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)

The charge calculated in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits requires estimates of the valuation of
parts of the business to determine the obligation for the LTIP. The estimates require the use of a number of
assumptions which, by their nature, are subjective.

**4. Seasonality and cyclicality**

There is no significant seasonality or cyclicality affecting the interim results of the operation.

**5. Segment information**

IFRS 8 Segmental Reporting requires disclosures in respect of the operating segments of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group according to the ‘management approach’. This approach reflects the type and extent of
information presented to the Cable & Wireless Communications Group Board.

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group Board considers the performance of the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s four principal operations in the Caribbean, Panama, Macau and Monaco & Islands in
assessing the performance of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group and making decisions about the
allocation of resources. Accordingly, these are the operating segments disclosed. The operating segments are
reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group Board.

F-94


-----

The Cable & Wireless Communications Group also operates the Central operations, a small central function
which acts as a portfolio manager. The Central operations are not considered to be an operating segment as it
does not earn revenue from its activities. The results of the Central operations are reported in the Other and
eliminations column.

**_Continuing operations_**

The operating segment results for the six months ended 30 September 2009, as provided to the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group Board, are presented below:

1 Other and eliminations includes the expenses of the Central operations of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group.

2 EBITDA is based on management reporting and is defined as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, LTIP credit/charge, net other operating income/expense and
exceptional items.

There are no differences in the measurement of the reportable segments’ results and the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group’s results.

**6. Exceptional items**

Exceptional items totalled a net US$4 million charge before income tax and primarily comprised restructuring
costs offset by fair value gains.

The Group recognised US$22 million for redundancies and other costs associated with the “One Caribbean”
transformation programme, US$7 million of legal and other fees and US$2 million of ongoing restructuring in
Monaco & Islands. An exceptional tax credit of US$5 million was recognised in relation to these amounts.

The Group also recognised exceptional finance income of US$27 million in relation to fair value gains on foreign
exchange forward contracts. These movements are a result of the recent volatility in currency markets. These
contracts were entered into to reduce the risk on forecast cash repatriation from foreign operations.

1 Other comprises provisions relating to acquisitions, disposals, legal claims and claims against Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s former insurance operation.

During the first half of 2009/10 provisions decreased by US$32 million. There was a net US$9 million credit to EBITDA before exceptional items from the movement in provisions.

**_Property_**

Provision has been made for the lower of the best estimate of the unavoidable lease payments or cost of exit in
respect of vacant properties. Unavoidable lease payments represent the difference between the rentals due and
any income expected to be derived from the vacant properties being sub-let. The provision is expected to be used
over the shorter of the period to exit and the lease contract life.

**_Redundancy_**

Provision has been made for the total employee related costs of redundancies announced prior to the reporting
date. Amounts provided for and spent in the period relate to the “One Caribbean” restructuring programme. The
provision is expected to be used within one year.

**_Network and asset retirement obligations_**

Provision has been made for the best estimate of the unavoidable costs associated with redundant leased network
capacity. The provision is expected to be used over the shorter of the period to exit and the lease contract life.

Provision has also been made for the best estimate of the asset retirement obligation associated with office sites,
technical sites and domestic and sub-sea cabling. This provision is expected to be used at the end of the life of the
related asset on which the obligation arises.

**_Legal and other_**

Other provisions include amounts relating to specific legal claims against the Cable & Wireless Communications
Group, amounts relating to specific claims held against the Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s former
insurance operation, Pender, and amounts relating to acquisitions and disposals of Cable & Wireless
Communications Group companies and investments.

**8. Intangible assets**

During the period, goodwill in relation to Monaco Telecom increased by US$5 million. This comprised a
decrease of US$10 million related to dividend payments and a change in the fair value of the put option held by
the Principality of Monaco and an increase of US$15 million due to movements in foreign exchange.

**9. Property, plant and equipment**

During the period, US$96 million of property, plant and equipment was acquired. There were no significant
disposals of property, plant and equipment. The Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s capital
commitments at 30 September 2009 were US$49 million.

F-96


-----

**10. Pensions**

As at 30 September 2009, Cable & Wireless Communications Group’s share of the main UK defined benefit
scheme was an IAS 19 deficit of US$97 million compared with a deficit of US$10 million at 31 March 2009. The
increase in the deficit is largely due to the 1.3 percentage point reduction in the AA corporate bond discount rate
used to calculate pension liabilities for the purposes of IAS 19 reporting (5.4% used for 30 September 2009
valuation), which has more than offset the increase in the value of the scheme’s assets during the period.

During the period, the Cable & Wireless Group agreed an interim funding agreement with the trustees of the
main UK defined benefit pension scheme, pending the next full actuarial valuation due in March 2010. This
funding plan originally comprised payments from the Cable & Wireless Communications Group of US$3 million
in October 2009, US$6 million in October 2010 and US$14 million in April 2011, although the latter two
payments have been revised to US$14 million and US$32 million, respectively.

Further, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group has unfunded pension liabilities in the United Kingdom of
US$44 million (US$35 million at 31 March 2009). Other defined benefit schemes have a net IAS 19 surplus of
US$20 million (US$17 million surplus at 31 March 2009) after applying the asset ceiling provisions of IAS 19.

**11. Weighted average number of ordinary shares**

The weighted average number of ordinary shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share
was as follows:


**Six months**
**ended**

The number of ordinary shares in issue as at 30 September 2009 (excluding 29,685,671 of treasury shares) was
2,571,944,205.

**12. Dividends paid and proposed**

The interim dividend proposed for the six month period ended 30 September 2009 was US$127 million (4.96
cents per share). The proposed dividend was approved by the Board of Directors on 4 November 2009. The
interim dividend paid for the corresponding six month period ended 30 September 2008 was US$141 million
(5.55 cents per share).

The final dividend paid on 7 August 2009 for the full year ended 31 March 2009 was US$216 million (9.97 cents
per share). The final dividend paid on 8 August 2008 for the corresponding full year ended 31 March 2008 was
US$201 million (10.02 cents per share).

**13. Related parties**

Two Directors hold bonds issued by Cable and Wireless plc with a nominal value at 30 September 2009 of
£2,630,000 (US$4,193,535) (purchased in 2008/09). The interest earned on these bonds during the six months
ended 30 September 2009 was £114,776 (US$180,279) of which £63,532 (US$101,302) remains unpaid at
30 September 2009.

The spouse of a Director holds bonds issued by Cable and Wireless plc with a nominal value at 30 September
2009 of £480,000 (US$765,360) (purchased in 2008/09). The interest earned on these bonds during the six
months ended 30 September 2009 was £20,757 (US$32,603) of which £20,757 (US$33,097) remains unpaid at
30 September 2009.

**14. Subsequent events**

Other than as set out below, there have been no material subsequent events between 30 September 2009 and the
approval of these statements by the Board.

During October 2009, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group purchased a further 7% of the share capital
of Dhiraagu from the Maldives government for cash consideration of US$40 million. This transaction will result
in the Cable & Wireless Communications Group reclassifying its joint venture investment in this entity to a
subsidiary investment.

**Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in Respect of Directors’ Report and the Financial Statements**

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report and the financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law they
have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable law
(UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

The financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company
and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.

In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:

    - select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

    - make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

    - state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and

    - prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that
the Company will continue in business.

The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at
any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply
with the Companies Act 1985. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to
them to safeguard the assets of the Company and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.

**Directors report and financial statements**

**For the year ended 31 March 2008**

**Report of the Independent Auditors, KPMG Audit PLc, to the Members of Sable Holding Limited**

We have audited the financial statements of Sable Holding Limited for the year ended 31 March 2008 which
comprise the Profit and Loss Account, Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses, Reconciliation of
movements in shareholders’ funds, the Balance Sheet and the related notes. These financial statements have been
prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.

This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the
Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the
company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

**Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors**

The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and UK
Accounting Standards (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’
Responsibilities on page F-101.

Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).

We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the
information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements.

In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have
not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law
regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.

We read the Directors’ Report and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements within it.

**Basis of audit opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments
made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.

We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming
our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.

**Directors report and financial statements**

**For the year ended 31 March 2008**

**Notes to the financial statements**

**1.** **Accounting Policies**

The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered
material in relation to the financial statements.

**_Basis of preparation_**

The financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and under the historical
cost accounting rules.

The Company is exempt by virtue of section 228 of the Companies Act 1985 from the requirement to prepare
group accounts. These financial statements present information about the Company as an individual undertaking
and not about its group.

**_Cash flow statement_**

Under FRS1 (Revised), the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement on the
grounds that it is a wholly owned subsidiary undertaking. A consolidated cash flow statement is included in the
financial statements of Cable and Wireless plc in which the Company is consolidated and which are publicly
available from the address in note 15.

**_Investments_**

Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less amounts written off in respect of any impairments.

**_Foreign currencies_**

Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction or,
if hedged forward, at the rate of exchange under the related forward currency contract. Monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the contracted rate or the rate of exchange ruling
at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account.

**_Taxation_**

The charge for taxation is based on the result for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of
timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.

Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of
certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date,
except as otherwise required by FRS 19.

**2.** **Information regarding Auditors, Directors and Employees**

Directors’ emoluments are borne by other group companies in the current and prior year.

The Company had no employees during the year (2007: nil).

statements has been borne by another group company.

**Directors report and financial statements**

**For the year ended 31 March 2009**

**Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in Respect of Directors’ Report and the Financial Statements**

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report and the fmancial statements in accordance with
applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law they
have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable law
(UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

The financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company
and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.

In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:

    - select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

    - make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

    - state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and

    - prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that
the Company will continue in business.

The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at
any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply
with the Companies Act 1985. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to
them to safeguard the assets of the Company and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.

**SABLE HOLDING LIMITED**

**Directors report and financial statements**

**For the year ended 31 March 2009**

**Report of the Independent Auditors, KPMG AUDIT Plc, to the Members of Sable Holding Limited**

We have audited the financial statements of Sable Holding Limited for the year ended 31 March 2009 which
comprise the profit and loss account, statement of total recognised gains and losses, reconciliation of movements
in shareholders’ funds, the balance sheet, and the related notes. These financial statements have been prepared
under the accounting policies set out therein.

This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the
Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the
company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

**Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors**

The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and UK
Accounting Standards (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’
Responsibilities on page F-114.

Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).

We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the
information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements.

In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have
not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law
regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.

We read the Directors’ Report and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements within it.

**Basis of audit opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments
made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.

We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming
our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.

**SABLE HOLDING LIMITED**

**Directors report and financial statements**

**For the year ended 31 March 2009**

**Notes to the financial statements**

**1.** **Accounting Policies**

The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered
material in relation to the financial statements.

**_Basis of preparation_**

The financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and on the historical
cost basis.

The Company is exempt by virtue of section 228 of the Companies Act 1985 from the requirement to prepare
group accounts. These financial statements present information about the Company as an individual undertaking
and not about its group.

The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis. The Directors have reviewed the
financial position of the Company, including the arrangements with group undertakings, and believe that it
remains appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis. The financial statements do not
include any adjustments that would result from the going concern basis of preparation being inappropriate.

**_Cash flow statement_**

Under FRS1 (Revised), the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement on the
grounds that it is a wholly owned subsidiary undertaking. A consolidated cash flow statement is included in the
financial statements of Cable and Wireless plc in which the Company is consolidated and which are publicly
available from the address in note 15.

**_Investments_**

Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less amounts written off in respect of any impairments.

**_Borrowings_**

Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently
stated at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value
is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement
of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date.

**_Foreign currencies_**

Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction or,
if hedged forward, at the rate of exchange under the related forward currency contract. Monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the contracted rate or the rate of exchange ruling
at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account.

**_Taxation_**

The charge for taxation is based on the result for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of
timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.

Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of
certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date,
except as otherwise required by FRS 19.

The Company has carried out a review to determine whether there has been an impairment in the carrying values
of its fixed asset investments in line with FRS 11 ‘Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill’. The review was
based on a combination of discounted cash flow analysis, using the group’s approved five year business plan, and
net asset values. This exercise has resulted in no impairment against the shares in group undertakings (2008:
£2,484,000) and an impairment of £3,451,000 being charged against the loan to Cable & Wireless Delaware 1,
Inc. (2008: £444,582,000).

**Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in Respect of the Directors’ Report and the Financial Statements**

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report and the financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law they
have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable law
(UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

The financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company
and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.

In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:

    - select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

    - make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

    - state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and

    - prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that
the Company will continue in business.

The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at
any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply
with the Companies Act 1985. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to
them to safeguard the assets of the Company and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.

**CWIGROUP LIMITED (Formerly Cable & Wireless International Group Limited)**

**Report of the Independent Auditors, KPMG AUDIT Plc, to the Members of CWIGroup Limited**
**(Formerly Cable & Wireless International Group Limited)**

We have audited the financial statements of CWIGroup Limited (formerly Cable & Wireless International Group
Limited) for the year ended 31 March 2008 which comprise the primary statements such as the Profit and Loss
Account, the Balance Sheet and the related notes. These financial statements have been prepared under the
accounting policies set out therein

This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the
Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

**Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors**

The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and UK
Accounting Standards (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’
Responsibilities on page F-128.

Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).

We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the
information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements.

In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have
not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law
regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.

We read the Directors’ Report and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements within it.

**Basis of audit opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments
made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.

We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming
our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.

**CWIGROUP LIMITED (Formerly Cable & Wireless International Group Limited)**

**NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS**

**Year ended 31 March 2008**

**I.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

**_Basis of preparation_**

The financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and on the historical
cost basis.

The Company has taken advantage of the exemption to prepare consolidated financial statements under
Section 228 of the Companies Act 1985, on the grounds that it is a wholly-owned subsidiary undertaking of
Cable and Wireless plc, a Company registered within the European Union. These financial statements present
information about the Company as an individual undertaking and not about its group.

The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis. The Directors have reviewed the
financial position of the Company, including the arrangements with group undertakings, and believe that it
remains appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis. The financial statements do not
include any adjustments that would result from the going concern basis of preparation being inappropriate.

**_Tax_**

The charge for tax is based on the result for the period and takes into account tax deferred due to timing
differences between the treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable. Deferred tax assets are
regarded as recoverable to the extent that on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely
than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing
differences can be deducted.

Except where otherwise required by accounting standards, full provision without discounting is made for all
timing differences which have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date.

**_Fixed asset investments_**

Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less amounts written off in respect of any impairments.

**_Cash long term incentive plan (‘LTIP’)_**

The Cable & Wireless Group operates a Cash LTIP. The plan rewards Executive Directors and certain senior
employees responsible for the International business division of Cable and Wireless plc, of which CWIGroup
Limited (formerly Cable & Wireless International Group Limited) is the principal holding company. The plan is
accounted for as an ‘other long term employee benefit’. A liability represents the estimated present value of the
obligation at the balance sheet date.

**_Dividend income_**

Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established. Dividend income is included
within finance income.

**2.** **INFORMATION REGARDING EMPLOYEES AND AUDITORS**

The Company had no employees during the year (2007: nil).

In the current and prior years, the auditor’s remuneration of £2,000 was borne by another group company.
Amounts paid to the Company’s auditor in respect of services to the Company, other than the audit of the
Company’s financial statements have not been disclosed as the information is required instead to be disclosed on
a consolidation basis in the financial statements of the Company’s ultimate parent, Cable and Wireless plc.

Amounts receivable under long term incentive schemes of £11,216,000 relate to Directors’ early termination
payments, in accordance with the early leaver rules under the Long Term Incentive Plan. At 31 March 2008,
£2,647,000 was accrued in respect of payments to Directors leaving the scheme after year end.

The aggregate of emoluments and amounts receivable under long term incentive schemes of the highest paid
director was £4,290,000 (2007: nil).

38,343 10.700

The long term incentive plan (‘LTIP’) is a performance based reward scheme. The LTIP creates a reward pool
over a four year period from 1 April 2006 (or until a vesting event, if earlier) depending on the extent to which
the Cable & Wireless International business division has grown in value from its base valuation at the start of the
period (£2,041 million). The base valuation is adjusted over the performance period i) to reflect additional capital
notionally treated as borrowed by the business ii) to reflect capital nationally returned by the business and iii)
increased by the notional weighted average cost of capital of the business (which will be at least 8% per annum
compounded). The charge for the year represents the movement in the present value of the obligation under the
scheme.

The total amount recognised in the accounts reflects two years of service out of the four year LTIP period,
payments made and the £1.1 billion increase in market capitalisation from 1 April 2006 to 3I March 2008. 10%
of that increase goes into the LTIP reward pool after taking into account the equity hurdle rate, the notional
interest charge and the cash flows in and out. The LTIP accrual does not represent a committed amount to
participants in the plan as the eventual payout is dependent on performance over the life of the plan and in
accordance with its rules.

Based on the results of its annual impairment review, the Company made a provision of £57,000,000 against the

**Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in Respect of the Directors’ Report and the Financial Statements**

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report and the financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law they
have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable law
(UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

The financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company
and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.

In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:

    - select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

    - make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

    - state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and

    - prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that
the Company will continue in business.

The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at
any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply
with the Companies Act 1985. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to
them to safeguard the assets of the Company and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.

**Report of the Independent Auditors, KPMG Audit Plc, to the Members of**
**CWIGroup Limited (Formerly Cable & Wireless International Group Limited)**

We have audited the financial statements of CWIGroup Limited (formerly Cable & Wireless International Group
Limited) for the year ended 31 March 2009 which comprise the primary statements such as the Profit and Loss
Account, the Balance Sheet and the related notes. These financial statements have been prepared under the
accounting policies set out therein.

This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the
Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

**Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors**

The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and UK
Accounting Standards (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’
Responsibilities on page F-141.

Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).

We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the
information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements.

In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have
not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law
regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.

We read the Directors’ Report and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements within it.

**Basis of audit opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments
made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.

We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming
our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.

**NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS**

**Year ended 31 March 2009**

**1.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

**_Basis of preparation_**

The financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and on the historical
cost basis.

The Company has taken advantage of the exemption to prepare consolidated financial statements under
Section 228 of the Companies Act 1985, on the grounds that it is a wholly-owned subsidiary undertaking of
Cable and Wireless plc, a Company registered within the European Union. These financial statements present
information about the Company as an individual undertaking and not about its group.

**_Going concern_**

The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, notwithstanding net current liabilities of
£700,145,000 (2008: net current liabilities £686,043,000). The Directors have reviewed the financial position of
the Company, including the arrangements with group undertakings, and believe that it remains appropriate to
prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis. The financial statements do not include any
adjustments that would result from the going concern basis of preparation being inappropriate.

**_Tax_**

The charge for tax is based on the result for the period and takes into account tax deferred due to timing
differences between the treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable. Deferred tax assets are
regarded as recoverable to the extent that on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely
than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing
differences can be deducted.

Except where otherwise required by accounting standards, full provision without discounting is made for all
timing differences which have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date.

**_Fixed asset investments_**

Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less amounts written off in respect of any impairments. Fixed asset
investments have indefinite useful lives, are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.

**_Cash long term incentive plan (‘LTIP’)_**

The Cable & Wireless Group operates a Cash LTIP. The plan rewards Executive Directors and certain senior
employees responsible for the CWI Group, of which CWIGroup Limited (formerly Cable & Wireless
International Group Limited) is the principal holding company. The plan is accounted for as an ‘other long term
employee benefit’. A liability represents the estimated present value of the obligation at the balance sheet date.

**_Exceptional items_**

Exceptional items are material items which derive from individual events that fall within the ordinary activities
of the Company that are identified as exceptional items by virtue of their size, nature or incidence.

**_Dividend income_**

Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established. Dividend income is included
within fmance income.

**2.** **INFORMATION REGARDING EMPLOYEES AND AUDITORS**

The Company had no employees during the year (2008: nil).

In the current and prior years, the auditor’s remuneration of £2,000 was borne by another group company.

Amounts paid to the Company’s auditor in respect of services to the Company, other than the audit of the
Company’s financial statements have not been disclosed as the information is required instead to be disclosed on
a consolidation basis in the fmancial statements of the Company’s ultimate parent, Cable and Wireless plc.

At 31 March 2009, £877,000 was accrued in respect of amounts payable to directors in accordance with the
scheme, as described in note 1.

Amounts receivable under long term incentive schemes during the preceding year relate to Directors’ early
termination payments, in accordance with the early leaver rules under the Long Term Incentive Plan. At
31 March 2008, £2,647,000 was accrued in respect of payments to Directors leaving the scheme after year end.
This was all paid during the current year.

The aggregate of emoluments and amounts receivable under long term incentive schemes of the highest paid
director was £446,000 (2008: £4,290,000).

The directors receive no remuneration in respect of their services to the Company.

The long term incentive plan (`LTIP’) is a performance based reward scheme. The LTIP creates a reward pool
over a four year period from 1 April 2006 (or until a vesting event, if earlier) depending on the extent to which
CWI Group has grown in value from its base valuation at the start of the period (£2,041 million). The base
valuation is adjusted over the performance period i) to reflect additional capital notionally treated as borrowed by
the business ii) to reflect capital notionally returned by the business and iii) increased by the notional weighted
average cost of capital of the business (which will be at least 8% per annum compounded). The charge for the
year represents the movement in the present value of the obligation under the scheme. If the business’ value is
lower than its adjusted base value at the end of the performance period, there will be no reward pool. To the
extent that the business’ value exceeds its adjusted base valuation at the end of the performance period, 10% of
the excess growth in value goes into the reward pool. 75 per cent. of the reward pool was payable to the
participants at the end of year three (April 2009), and 100% payable (less payments made at end of year three) to
all participants at the end of year four (April 2010). Measurement of the size of the reward pool is carried out
every six months to correspond with the Group’s accounting periods.

**Directors’ Report**

The Directors submit their annual report together with the audited financial statements of Cable and Wireless
(West Indies) Limited (‘the Company’) for the year ended 31 March 2008.

**PRINCIPAL ACTIVITY**

The principal activity of the Company is the provision of international and national public telecommunications in
the Caribbean. No change in the principal activity is envisaged in the foreseeable future.

**REVIEW OF THE BUSINESS**

Prior to 31 March 2007, the Company operated through wholly owned branches in St. Vincent, St. Lucia,
Anguilla, Antigua, British Virgin Islands, Montserrat and Turks and Caicos, together with a controlling interest
in companies which own and operate the internal and external telecommunications systems of Barbados, Cayman
Islands, Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica, Panama, Bermuda and St. Kitts and Nevis. In addition, the Company has a
minority interest in a company which owns and operates the internal and external telecommunications systems of
Trinidad and Tobago. Virtually all of the Company’s activities arise under licenses and franchises of prescribed
duration, granted by the Government concerned.

The Company incorporated its St. Vincent and St. Lucia branches on 31 March 2007, with the net assets of those
businesses being acquired by 100% subsidiaries of the Company, Cable & Wireless St. Vincent and the
Grenadines Limited and Cable and Wireless (St Lucia) Limited respectively.

The Company’s branches in Antigua, Anguilla, BVI and Turks and Caicos were incorporated during the year
ended 31 March 2008. On 30 June 2007, the net assets of the branch in Antigua were acquired by a 100%
subsidiary of the Company, Cable & Wireless Antigua & Barbuda Limited. On 1 November 2007 the net assets
of the branch in Anguilla were acquired by a 100% subsidiary of the Company, Cable and Wireless (Anguilla)
Limited. On 31 December 2007 the net assets of the branches in BVI and Turks and Caicos were acquired by
100% subsidiaries of the Company, Cable and Wireless (BVI) Limited and Cable and Wireless (TCI) Limited,
respectively.

**ENHANCED BUSINESS REVIEW**

The Company belongs to the international division of the Cable and Wireless group which operates
telecommunications companies in 33 countries, offering mobile, broadband, domestic and international fixed line
services to residential and business customers.

Across our markets, we face broadly the same issues. New technologies are driving down the price of existing
offerings. At the same time, liberalisation has seen new entrants seeking to challenge our position and driving
price erosion as they compete aggressively. Additionally, we are responding to continuing developments in
regulatory and government policy.

We are meeting the challenge of increased competition head on by ensuring that we provide the best possible
quality, value and innovative services to our customers. This means that we must be responsive to the
technological innovations and competitive forces in the marketplace and strive to meet these challenges with
continuous improvement to our products and offering.

Turnover has decreased by 62% to £48,098,000 in 2008, from £125,750,000 in 2007. This was largely due to the
accounting consequences of incorporations of the Company’s branches in the current and prior years.

**EMPLOYEES**

The average weekly number of persons employed by the Company decreased by 75% from 832 in the prior year
to 206 in 2008. The Company is committed to recognizing employees’ achievements by granting awards and by
publishing the employees’ contributions in the Cable & Wireless Americas and Caribbean biannual newsletter.
The Company is committed to continual enhancement of its employees’ skills by providing adequate training and
by using the intranet to publish relevant policies and practices, which are updated on a regular basis to reflect
changes in legislation.

**RISKS**

Fluctuations in currency exchange rates in the countries where we operate may adversely affect our reported
results and financial condition. A significant percentage of our business is conducted in different currencies. We
are thus exposed to movements in exchange rates in relation to foreign currency receipts and payments, dividend
and other income from foreign subsidiaries, reported profits of foreign subsidiaries and the net asset carrying
value of foreign investments particularly in respect of the £/US dollar exchange rate. The ultimate parent of the
Company, Cable and Wireless plc, manages the group exposure to movements in exchange rates on a net basis
and, where appropriate, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts and other derivative and financial
instruments to mitigate the exposure.

Much of the Company’s business is conducted within the Caribbean hurricane zone. These storms pose a risk to
the Company’s property and employees. This risk is mitigated as much as possible by locating premises and
equipment in the safest areas and ensuring that their construction is strong enough to withstand these storms.

Increased global competition is an inherent risk for most companies. This is especially relevant for the Company
as many of the markets in which it operates have recently been deregulated, resulting in increased competition.
The Company has responded well to this increased competition and has remained the market leader in most
markets across the Caribbean.

**RESULTS AND DIVIDENDS**

The profit for the year before the payment of the dividend and after the payment of tax was £136,758,000 (2007:
£132,823,000).

The aggregate amount of dividends paid in the year was £50,009,000 (2007: £584,103,000).

**SUBSEQUENT EVENTS**

On 23 May 2008 the Directors of the Company approved the provision of a guarantee in respect of the
obligations of Sable International Finance Limited (“SIFT.”), a 100% subsidiary of Sable Holding Limited,
pursuant to a USD415 million revolving facilities agreement arranged by BNP Paribas and J.P. Morgan. The
facilities, which have been provided for the general corporate purposes of the Cable & Wireless group, were
extended against expected future cash flows of the Company and some other subsidiaries of the Cable &
Wireless International business, as demonstrated to the satisfaction of the arrangers. All Group companies
involved in the guarantee and the facility are 100% owned subsidiaries of the Cable & Wireless Group.

On the 24 September 2007, the Company, purchased an additional 17.05% stake in Cable and Wireless (St.
Kitts & Nevis) Limited from the Government of the Federation of St. Kitts & Nevis, taking its total share holding
to 82.25%. Within 12 months of completion, under the terms of the sale and purchase agreement, the Company
was required to offer for sale 5% of the company via a public offering to the residents of St. Kitts and Nevis. In
April 2008 the Company sold this 5% shareholding.

**PAYMENTS TO SUPPLIERS**

The Company agrees payment terms with its suppliers when it enters into purchase contracts. The Company
seeks to abide by the payment terms agreed with suppliers whenever it is satisfied that the supplier has provided
the goods or services in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions. The Company seeks to treat all its
suppliers fairly and applies a standard in dealing with the payment of suppliers.

The Company had 31 days purchases (2007—55 days purchases) outstanding at 31 March 2008 based on the
average daily amount invoiced by suppliers during the year ended 31 March 2008.

**Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in Respect of the Directors’ Report and the Financial Statements**

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report and the financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law they
have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable law
(UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

The financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company
and of the profit or loss of the Company for that year.

In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:

    - select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

    - make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

    - state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and

    - prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that
the Company will continue in business.

The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at
any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply
with the Companies Act 1985. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to
them to safeguard the assets of the Company and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.

**Report of the Independent Auditors, KPMG Audit Plc, to the Members of**

31 March 2008, which comprise the Profit and Loss Account, the Balance Sheet, the Statement of Total
Recognised Gains and Losses, the Reconciliation of Movements in Equity Shareholder’s Funds and the related
notes. These financial statements have been prepared under the primary statements such as the accounting
policies set out therein.

This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the
Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

**Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors**

As described in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities on page F-156, the Company’s Directors are
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and UK Accounting
Standards (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).

We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the
information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements.

In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have
not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law
regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed. We read the Directors’ Report and
consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements within it.

**Basis of audit opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments
made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.

We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming
our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.

**CABLE AND WIRELESS (WEST INDIES) LIMITED**

**NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS**

**Year ended 31 March 2008**

**1.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

The principal accounting policies of the Company are summarised below:

(a) **_Basis of preparation_**

The financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the UK and on
the historical cost basis.

(b) **_Group accounts_**

The Company has taken advantage of the exemption to prepare consolidated financial statements under
Section 228 of the Companies Act 1985, on the grounds that it is a wholly-owned subsidiary undertaking of
Cable and Wireless, a Company registered within the European Economic Area (“EEA”). These financial
statements present information about the Company as an individual undertaking and not about its group.

(c) **_Fixed asset investments_**

Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less amounts written off in respect of any impairment.

(d) **_Foreign currencies_**

Average rates of exchange ruling during the year are used to translate the profit and loss accounts of
overseas branches. The assets and liabilities of overseas branches are translated at the closing rate of
exchange. Exchange differences arising are taken to the profit and loss reserve in accordance with SSAP 20
‘Foreign Currency Translation’. All other exchange differences are dealt with through the profit and loss
account.

(e) **_Tangible fixed assets and depreciation_**

Depreciation of tangible fixed assets is set aside on the basis of providing in equal annual instalments for the
cost over the estimated useful lives of these assets, namely:

Telephone cables and repeaters 15 years
Freehold buildings 40 years
Leasehold land and buildings 40 years or term of lease if less
Plant 3 to 40 years (average 13 years)

Freehold land, where the cost is distinguishable from the cost of the building thereon, is not depreciated.

(f) **_Asset impairment_**

Intangible and tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Where an impairment indicator is
identified, the carrying value of the income generating unit is compared with its recoverable amount. Where
the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value an impairment is recognised.

(g) **_Taxation_**

The charge for tax is based on the profit or loss for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because
of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.

(h) **_Deferred taxation_**

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the
balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in future or a

F-162


-----

**CABLE AND WIRELESS (WEST INDIES) LIMITED**

**NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS—(Continued)**

**Year ended 31 March 2008**

right to pay less tax in future have occurred at the balance sheet date unless as otherwise required by
FRS 19. Timing differences are differences between the Company’s taxable profits and its results as stated
in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods
different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements. A net deferred tax asset is
regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be
regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of
the underlying timing differences can be deducted.

(i) **_Stocks_**

Stocks of equipment, held for use in the maintenance and expansion of the Company’s telecommunications
systems, are stated at cost, less provision for deterioration and obsolescence.

(j) **_Pensions_**

The Company participates in both funded defined contribution and funded defined benefit pension plans.
Contributions to defined contribution plans are expensed as incurred. Contributions to the defined benefit
plan operated by Cable and Wireless are determined by an independent actuary and provides benefits based
on final pensionable pay. As permitted by FRS 17, the Company is exempt from accounting for pension
schemes as defined benefit schemes since it is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and
liabilities from those of the other participating employers within the group. Therefore the Company has
treated the pension schemes as if they were defined contribution schemes and has expenses contributions as
incurred.

(k) **_Leases_**

Operating leases are charged to trading profit on a straight line basis over the lease term.

(l) **_Share based payments_**

The Company operates various equity-settled, share-based compensation plans. The fair value of the
employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense. The total
amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options
granted, which excludes the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for example, profitability and
sales growth targets). Non-market vesting conditions are included in estimates about the number of options
that are expected to become exercisable. At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimates of
the number of options that are expected to become exercisable. It recognises the impact of the revision of
original non-market estimates if any, in the profit and loss, and a corresponding adjustment to equity over
the remaining vesting period. The expense recognised in the Company relates only to the Company
employees.

Share based expenses relating to grants of the ultimate parent Company’s equity made to employees of
subsidiary companies are recognised in the profit and loss account of the subsidiary and the parent company
does not record any entries on the award of these options except when the options are exercised.

The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital and
share premium when the options are exercised.

Where continuing employees withdraw from share-based compensation plans the remaining charge is
recognised immediately.

(m) Comparative Information

Certain comparative disclosures in the profit and toss account have been updated, in accordance with the
requirements of FRS3 to reflect the discontinued status of the company’s branch operations in Antigua,
Anguilla, BVI and Turks & Caicos, as discussed in note 6.

**2.** **TURNOVER**

Turnover, which excludes value added tax, represents the amount receivable in respect of telecommunications
services provided to customers and is accounted for on the accruals basis. Amounts are recognised as services are
provided; in respect of services invoiced in advance, amounts are deferred until provision of the service.

Amounts payable by and to telecommunications operators of national and international networks are recognised
as services are provided. Charges are negotiated separately and are subject to continuous review. Revenue is
earned from the transmission of content on its network originated by third-party providers. The Company
assesses whether revenue should be recorded gross as principal or net as agent, based on the features of such
arrangements including the following indicators:

    - Whether the branch holds itself out as an agent;

    - Establishment of the price;

    - Provision of customer remedies;

    - Performance of part of the service; and

    - Assumption of credit risk.

The Company’s operations are all considered to fall into one class of business, namely telecommunications, all of
which arise in the Caribbean region. Turnover can be analysed as follows:

None of the Directors received any emoluments from the Company (2007: £nil).

**5.** **PENSIONS**

**_Defined contribution scheme:_**

The pension cost charged for the year represents contributions payable by the Company to the schemes described
in note 1 to these financial statements. During the year these contributions amounted to £207,000 (2007:
£683,000). No amounts were outstanding at the end of the financial year in respect of this charge.

**_Multi-employer defined benefit scheme:_**

The Company is a member of a group-wide pension scheme providing benefits based on final personable pay.
Because the Company is unable to identify its share of the scheme assets and liabilities on a consistent and
reasonable basis, as permitted by FRS 17 Retirement Benefits the scheme has been accounted for, in these
financial statements, as if the scheme was a defined contribution scheme.

The latest triennial valuation was carried out by Watson Wyatt as at 31 March 2007 and was updated for FRS17
purposes to 31 March 2008. The ordinary contribution for the year was £8,000 (2007—£93,000). An employer
contribution rate of 28.5% (2006/2007—22.3%) of pensionable pay has been applied from 1 April 2007.

The Company is not able to separate the performance of the group wide scheme to give the element that relates
solely to the Company’s employees. At 31 March 2008 the group wide scheme had a Nil deficit/Surplus (2007—
surplus £43 million)

More details are included in the financial statements of Cable and Wireless plc for the year ended 31 March
2008. These accounts can be obtained from the Secretary, Cable and Wireless plc, 3rd Floor, 26 Red Lion
Square, London, WCI R 4HQ.

**6.** **SALE OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS**

The branches in Antigua, Anguilla, BVI and Turks and Caicos were incorporated during the year ended
31 March 2008, with a resulting realised gain on disposal of £40,808,460 and an unrealised gain on disposal of
£55,824,670.

On 30 June 2007, the net assets of the branch in Antigua were acquired by a 100% subsidiary of the Company,
Cable & Wireless Antigua & Barbuda Limited. On 1 November 2007 the net assets of the branch in Anguilla
were acquired by a 100% subsidiary of the Company, Cable and Wireless (Anguilla) Limited. On 31 December
2007 the net assets of the branches in BVI and Turks and Caicos were acquired by 100% subsidiaries of the
Company, Cable and Wireless (BVI) Limited and Cable and Wireless TCI Limited, respectively.

On 15 December 2006 Cariaccess Communications (St. Vincent) Limited served a writ on the Company suing
the Company and the telecommunications regulator in St. Vincent for US$42 million, which the Company
intends to vigorously defend. At 31 March 2007 all assets and liabilities of the St. Vincent branch were sold to
Cable and Wireless St. Vincent and the Grenadines Limited, with the effect that any liability arising from this
claim will be accounted for in future Cable and Wireless St. Vincent and the Grenadines Limited accounts.
Following an application by the Company, a similar claim in St. Lucia was struck out by a judgment of the Saint
Lucia High Court on 15 March 2007.

In July 2007, Cable and Wireless plc, the Company and certain other Cable & Wireless subsidiaries received a
claim from their Caribbean competitor, Digicel, which they believe is without foundation and will be vigorously
defended. Based on legal advice, we are making no provision for the claim itself, but Cable and Wireless plc has
recorded a charge of £11 million for the legal fees for the defence of the claim. At 31 March 2008 the remaining
provision stood at £8.2 million following the incursion of legal costs related to this claim. No provision or charge
is in the Company’s financial statements.

No provision has been made in the financial statements for the above legal matters as the Directors consider the
possibility of the claim being successful to be remote.

Cable and Wireless (West Indies) Limited provided guarantees in respect of loans taken out by Cable and
Wireless Antigua and Barbuda Limited in June 2007, by Cable and Wireless St. Vincent & The Grenadines
Limited and by Cable and Wireless Caribbean Cellular (St. Lucia) Limited in March 2007, to facilitate the
purchase of their respective branch assets from Cable and Wireless (West Indies) Limited. The total value of the
principals of these loans is £23,854,000 and the total value of the guarantees on these loans is £26,975,000. To
date all of the terms of these loan agreements have been met and no provision has been made in respect of the
guarantees on these loans.

**21. CASH FLOW STATEMENT**

Under FRS1 (revised), the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement on the
grounds that it is a wholly owned subsidiary undertaking. A cashflow statement is included in the financial
statements of Cable and Wireless plc.

**22. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

Under FRS 8, the Company is exempt from the requirement to disclose transactions with entities that are part of
the Cable & Wireless Group, or investees of the Group qualifying as related parties, as all of the Company’s
voting rights are controlled within that Group. There are no material transactions with any other related parties.

obligations of fellow group subsidiary Sable International Finance Limited (“SIFL”), a 100% subsidiary of Sable
Holding Limited, pursuant to a USD415 million revolving facilities agreement arranged by BNP Paribas and J.P.
Morgan. The facilities, which have been provided for the general corporate purposes of the Cable & Wireless
group, were extended against expected future cash flows of the Company and certain other subsidiaries of the
Cable & Wireless International business, as demonstrated to the satisfaction of the arrangers. All Group
companies involved in the guarantee and the facility are 100% owned members of the Cable & Wireless Group.

On the 24 September 2007, the Company, purchased an additional 17.05% stake in Cable and Wireless (St.
Kitts & Nevis) Limited from the Government of the Federation of St. Kitts & Nevis, taking its total share holding
to 82.25%. Within 12 months of completion, under the terms of the sale and purchase agreement, the Company
was required to offer for sale 5% of the company via a public offering to the residents of St. Kitts and Nevis. In
April 2008 the Company sold this 5% shareholding.

**Directors’ Report**

The Directors submit their annual report together with the audited financial statements of Cable and Wireless
(West Indies) Limited (‘the Company’) for the year ended 31 March 2009.

**PRINCIPAL ACTIVITY**

The principal activity of the Company is the provision of international and national public telecommunications in
the Caribbean. No change in the principal activity is envisaged in the foreseeable future.

**REVIEW OF THE BUSINESS**

During the year ended 31 March 2009 the Company continued management of its Montserrat Branch and
providing management support services to its subsidiaries and associates across the Caribbean.

The Company’s branches in Antigua, Anguilla, British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos were incorporated
during the year ended 31 March 2008.

The Company continued to operate through controlling interests in companies which own and operate the
internal and external telecommunications systems of St.Vincent, St. Lucia, Barbados, Cayman Islands, Dominica,
Grenada, Jamaica, Panama, Bermuda and St. Kitts and Nevis.

In addition, the Company has a minority interest in a company which owns and operates the internal and external
telecommunications systems of Trinidad and Tobago. Virtually all of the Company’s activities arise under
licenses and franchises of prescribed duration, granted by the Government concerned.

**ENHANCED BUSINESS REVIEW**

The Company belongs to the international division of the Cable & Wireless group which operates
telecommunications companies, offering mobile, broadband, domestic and international fixed line services to
residential and business customers.

Across our markets, we face broadly the same issues. New technologies are driving down the price of existing
offerings. At the same time, liberalisation has seen new entrants seeking to challenge our position and driving
price erosion as they compete aggressively. Additionally, we are responding to continuing developments in
regulatory and government policy.

We are meeting the challenge of increased competition head on by ensuring that we provide the best possible
quality, value and innovative services to our customers. This means that we must be responsive to the
technological innovations and competitive forces in the marketplace and strive to meet these challenges with
continuous improvement to our products and offering.

Turnover has decreased by 94% to £2,803,000 in 2009, from £48,098,000 in 2008. This was largely due to the
accounting consequences of incorporations of some of the Company’s branches in the prior year. As a result of
incorporation of the Company’s branches, in future, income from the former branches will be received as
dividends. Turnover of the continuing operation in Montserrat increased by 19% during the year from £2,348,000
in 2008 to £2,803,000 in 2009.

The Montserrat business unit is currently the only official provider of telecommunications services in Montserrat
after the notification and expiry of the exclusive operating licence in March 2007. However, the Government has
recently announced the imminent liberalisation of the telecommunications market and has enacted legislation to
enable the introduction of service by our competitors, most likely Digicel and Caribbean Cable Communications,
who compete with us in other markets. It is expected that competitors will enter the Montserrat market within the
next 12 months.

During the year a major transformation project which has been fully sanctioned by Cable and Wireless plc,
continued. This focused on key issues of brand & image (services have been rebranded as LIME—LandLine,
Internet, Mobile & Entertainment), customer service, human resource rationalisation, platform & systems
optimisation, regional administration, and marketing & sales efforts.

**CABLE AND WIRELESS (WEST INDIES) LIMITED**

**EMPLOYEES**

The average weekly number of persons employed by the Company decreased by 90% from 206 in the prior year
to 20 in 2009 as a result of the incorporation of the Company’s branches. The Company is committed to
recognising employees’ achievements by granting awards and by publishing the employees’ contributions in the
Cable & Wireless Americas and Caribbean bi-annual newsletter. The Company is committed to continual
enhancement of its employees’ skills by providing adequate training and by using the intranet to publish relevant
policies and practices, which are updated on a regular basis to reflect changes in legislation.

**RISKS**

Fluctuations in currency exchange rates in the countries where we operate may adversely affect our reported
results and financial condition. A significant percentage of our business is conducted in different currencies. We
are thus exposed to movements in exchange rates in relation to foreign currency receipts and payments, dividend
and other income from foreign subsidiaries, reported profits of foreign subsidiaries and the net asset carrying
value of foreign investments particularly in respect of the £/US dollar exchange rate. The ultimate parent of the
Company, Cable and Wireless plc, manages the group exposure to movements in exchange rates on a net basis
and, where appropriate, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts and other derivative and financial
instruments to mitigate the exposure.

Much of the Company’s business is conducted within the Caribbean hurricane zone. These storms pose a risk to
the Company’s property and employees. This risk is mitigated as much as possible by locating premises and
equipment in the safest areas and ensuring that their construction is strong enough to withstand these storms.

Increased global competition is an inherent risk for most companies. As noted above, the imminent liberalisation
of the Montserrat telecommunications market will introduce competition into that market and will pose a risk to
our business there.

**RESULTS AND DIVIDENDS**

The profit for the year before the payment of the dividend and after the payment of tax was £100,592,000 (2008:
£136,758,000).

The aggregate amount of dividends paid in the year was nil (2008: £50,009,000).

**PAYMENTS TO SUPPLIERS**

The Company agrees payment terms with its suppliers when it enters into purchase contracts. The Company
seeks to abide by the payment terms agreed with suppliers whenever it is satisfied that the supplier has provided
the goods or services in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions. The Company seeks to treat all its
suppliers fairly and applies a standard in dealing with the payment of suppliers.

The Company had 63 days purchases (2008—31 days purchases) outstanding at 31 March 2009 based on the
average daily amount invoiced by suppliers during the year ended 31 March 2009.

**DIRECTORS**

The Directors who held office during the year and subsequent to the year end are as follows:

JPM Jankovich-Besan resigned 30 April 2008
ST Irvine resigned 29 August 2008
PSJ Davis resigned 10 December 2008
BPJ Buckley appointed 8 May 2008—resigned 31 December 2008
R Burge appointed 29 July 2008
IL Pennington appointed 9 October 2008
C Underwood appointed 10 February 2009
BUY Bradberry appointed 10 February 2009

All Directors benefit from qualifying third party indemnity provisions in place during the financial year and at
the date of this report.

**Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in Respect of the Directors’ Report and the Financial Statements**

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report and the financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each fmancial year. Under that law they
have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable law
(UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

The financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company
and of the profit or loss of the Company for that year.

In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:

    - select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

    - make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

    - state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and

    - prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that
the Company will continue in business.

The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at
any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply
with the Companies Act 1985. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to
them to safeguard the assets of the Company and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.

**Report of the Independent Auditors, KPMG AUDIT Plc, to the Members of Cable and Wireless**
**(WEST INDIES) Limited**

We have audited the financial statements of Cable and Wireless (West Indies) Limited for the year ended
31 March 2009, which comprise the Profit and Loss Account, the Balance Sheet, the Statement of Total
Recognised Gains and Losses, the Reconciliation of Movements in Equity Shareholder’s Funds and the related
notes. These fmancial statements have been prepared under the primary statements such as the accounting
policies set out therein.

This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the
Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

**Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors**

The director’s responsibilities for preparing the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and UK
accounting standards (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the statement of directors
responsibilities on page F-178.

Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).

We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the
information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements.

In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have
not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law
regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed. We read the Directors’ Report and
consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements within it.

**Basis of audit opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments
made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.

We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming
our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.

**CABLE AND WIRELESS (WEST INDIES) LIMITED**

**NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS**

**Year ended 31 March 2009**

**1.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

The principal accounting policies of the Company are summarised below:

(a) **_Basis of preparation_**

The financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the UK and on
the historical cost accounting rules. Accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with
items which are considered material in relation to the financial statements.

The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, notwithstanding net current liabilities
of £199,807,000 (2008: net current liabilities £300,272,000). The Directors have reviewed the financial
position of the Company, including the arrangements with group undertakings, and believe that it remains
appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis. The financial statements do not
include any adjustments that would result from the going concern basis of preparation being inappropriate.

(b) **_Group accounts_**

The Company has taken advantage of the exemption to prepare consolidated financial statements under
Section 228 of the Companies Act 1985, on the grounds that it is a wholly-owned subsidiary undertaking of
Cable and Wireless plc, a company registered within the European Economic Area (“EEA”). These
financial statements present information about the Company as an individual undertaking and not about its
group.

(c) **_Fixed asset investments_**

Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less amounts written off in respect of any impairment. Fixed asset
investments have indefmite useful lives, are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for
impairment.

(d) **_Foreign currencies_**

Average rates of exchange ruling during the year are used to translate the profit and loss accounts of
overseas branches. The assets and liabilities of overseas branches are translated at the closing rate of
exchange. Exchange differences arising are taken to the profit and loss reserve in accordance with SSAP 20
‘Foreign Currency Translation’. All other exchange differences are dealt with through the profit and loss
account.

(e) **_Tangible fixed assets and depreciation_**

Fixed assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation
of tangible fixed assets is set aside on the basis of providing in equal annual instalments for the cost over the
estimated useful lives of these assets, namely:

Telephone cables and repeaters 15 years
Freehold buildings 40 years
Leasehold land and buildings 40 years or term of lease if less
Plant and Machinery 3 to 40 years (average 13 years)

Freehold land, where the cost is distinguishable from the cost of the building thereon, is not depreciated.

Fixed assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of the asset may not be recoverable Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value an
impairment is recognised.

(g) **_Taxation_**

The charge for tax is based on the profit or loss for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because
of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.

**NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS—(Continued)**

**Year ended 31 March 2009**

(h) **_Deferred taxation_**

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the
balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in future or a
right to pay less tax in future have occurred at the balance sheet date unless as otherwise required by FRS
19. Timing differences are differences between the Company’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the
financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different
from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements. A net deferred tax asset is regarded as
recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as
more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the
underlying timing differences can be deducted.

(i) **_Stocks_**

Stocks of equipment, held for use in the maintenance and expansion of the Company’s telecommunications
systems, are stated at cost, less provision for deterioration and obsolescence.

(j) **_Pensions_**

The Company participates in both funded defined contribution and funded defined benefit pension plans.
Contributions to defined contribution plans are expensed as incurred. Contributions to the defined benefit
plan operated by Cable and Wireless are determined by an independent actuary and provides benefits based
on final pensionable pay. As permitted by FRS 17, the Company is exempt from accounting for pension
schemes as defined benefit schemes since it is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and
liabilities from those of the other participating employers within the group. Therefore the Company has
treated the pension schemes as if they were defined contribution schemes and has expensed contributions as
incurred.

(k) **_Leases_**

Operating leases are charged to trading profit on a straight line basis over the lease term.

Assets acquired under finance leases are capitalised and the outstanding future lease obligations are shown
in creditors.

(l) **_Share based payments_**

The Company operates various equity-settled, share-based compensation plans. The fair value of the
employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense. The total
amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options
granted, which excludes the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for example, profitability and
sales growth targets). Non-market vesting conditions are included in estimates about the number of options
that are expected to become exercisable. At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimates of
the number of options that are expected to become exercisable. It recognises the impact of the revision of
original non-market estimates if any, in the profit and loss, and a corresponding adjustment to equity over
the remaining vesting period. The expense recognised in the Company relates only to the Company
employees.

Share based expenses relating to grants of the ultimate parent company’s equity made to employees of
subsidiary companies are recognised in the profit and loss account of the subsidiary and the parent company
does not record any entries on the award of these options except when the options are exercised.

The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital and
share premium when the options are exercised.

Where continuing employees withdraw from share-based compensation plans the remaining charge is
recognised immediately.

**2.** **TURNOVER**

Turnover, which excludes value added tax, represents the amount receivable in respect of telecommunications
services provided to customers and is accounted for on the accruals basis. Amounts are recognised as services are
provided; in respect of services invoiced in advance, amounts are deferred until provision of the service.

Amounts payable by and to telecommunications operators of national and international networks are recognised
as services are provided. Charges are negotiated separately and are subject to continuous review.

Revenue is earned from the transmission of content on its network originated by third-party providers. The
Company assesses whether revenue should be recorded gross as principal or net as agent, based on the features of
such arrangements including the following indicators:

    - Whether the branch holds itself out as an agent;

    - Establishment of the price;

    - Provision of customer remedies;

    - Performance of part of the service; and

    - Assumption of credit risk.

The Company’s operations are all considered to fall into one class of business, namely telecommunications, all of
which arise in the Caribbean region. Turnover can be analysed as follows:

None of the Directors received any emoluments from the Company (2008: £nil).

**5.** **PENSIONS**

**_Defined contribution scheme_**

The pension cost charged for the year represents contributions payable by the Company to the schemes described
in note 1 to these financial statements. During the year these contributions amounted to £16,000 (2008:
£207,000). No amounts were outstanding at the end of the financial year in respect of this charge.

**_Multi-employer defined benefit scheme_**

The Company is a member of a group-wide pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay.
Because the Company is unable to identify its share of the scheme assets and liabilities on a consistent and
reasonable basis, as permitted by FRS 17 Retirement Benefits, the scheme has been accounted for, in these
financial statements, as if the scheme was a defined contribution scheme.

The latest triennial valuation was carried out by Watson Wyatt as at 31 March 2007 and was updated for FRS17
purposes to 31 March 2009. The ordinary contribution for the year was £12,000 (2008—£8,000). An employer
contribution rate of 28.5% (2008—28.5%) of pensionable pay has been applied from 1 April 2007.

The Company is not able to separate the performance of the group wide scheme to give the element that relates
solely to the Company’s employees. As an indication, however, the group-wide scheme had a deficit at 31 March
2009, before the effect of the asset ceiling, of £32 million, compared with £375 million surplus at 31 March
2008. Assumptions were changed relating to increased life expectancy, using the latest, generally adopted
mortality tables.

More details are included in the financial statements of Cable and Wireless plc for the year ended 31 March
2009. These accounts can be obtained from the Secretary, Cable and Wireless plc, 3rd Floor, 26 Red Lion
Square, London, WC1R 4HQ.

**6.** **SALE OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS**

The branches in Antigua, Anguilla, BVI and Turks and Caicos were incorporated during the year ended
31 March 2008, with a resulting realised gain on disposal of £40,808,460 and an unrealised gain on disposal of
£55,824,670.

On 30 June 2007, the net assets of the branch in Antigua were acquired by a 100% subsidiary of the Company,
Cable & Wireless Antigua & Barbuda Limited. On 1 November 2007 the net assets of the branch in Anguilla were
acquired by a 100% subsidiary of the Company, Cable and Wireless (Anguilla) Limited. On 31 December 2007

**19. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND GUARANTEES**

The Company had no capital commitments at 31 March 2009 (2008: nil). The Company has no operating lease
commitments.

In July 2007, Cable and Wireless plc, the Company and certain other Cable & Wireless subsidiaries received a
claim from their Caribbean competitor, Digicel, which they believe is without foundation and will be vigorously
defended. Based on legal advice, we are making no provision for the claim itself, which we believe will be
defended successfully. Ongoing legal fees are being taken by Cable and Wireless plc.

No provision has been made in the financial statements for the above legal matters as the Directors consider the
possibility of the claim being successful to be remote.

The Company provided guarantees in respect of loans taken out by Cable & Wireless Antigua & Barbuda
Limited in June 2007, by Cable and Wireless St. Vincent & The Grenadines Limited and by Cable and Wireless
Caribbean Cellular (St. Lucia) Limited in March 2007, to facilitate the purchase of their respective branch assets
from Cable and Wireless (West Indies) Limited. The total value of the principals of these loans is £26,662,490
(2008; £23,854,000) and the total value of the guarantees on these loans is £37,206,660 (2008; £26,975,000). To
date all of the terms of these loan agreements have been met and no provision has been made in respect of the
guarantees on these loans.

The Company is a guarantor, jointly and severally with Cable & Wireless International HQ Limited, of the
obligations of Sable International Finance Limited in its capacity as borrower under a US$415,000,000 Facilities
Agreement dated 23 May 2008, as amended and restated on 29 August 2008. Both Cable & Wireless
International HQ Limited and Sable International Finance Limited are subsidiaries in the Cable & Wireless
group. Subject to early repayment, the Facilities Agreement terminates on 22 May 2011.

Since the end of the year ended 31 March 2009, the Company has become a guarantor, jointly and severally with
Cable & Wireless International HQ Limited, Cable and Wireless plc and Sable Holding Limited of the
obligations of Sable International Finance Limited in its capacity as borrower under a US$152,500,000 Facility
Agreement dated 28 August 2009. Subject to early repayment or extension, the Facility Agreement terminates on
28 August 2010.

**ANNEX A—CABLE & WIRELESS WORLDWIDE GROUP INFORMATION**

The proposed Demerger discussed elsewhere in this document involves a number of steps, each of which must be
approved or sanctioned if process is to result in the successful demerger of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group from the existing Cable & Wireless Group.

The Demerger is the culmination of work which began in April 2006, when the Cable & Wireless Group created
two largely distinct operating units under the Cable and Wireless plc umbrella to reflect the differing
characteristics of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group and
to establish clear strategies for both. Significant progress has been made since then, including the institution of
separate stand alone capital structures, and the Cable and Wireless plc Board considers that the two businesses
have now put in place the necessary arrangements to operate as independent, publicly-quoted businesses.

Although it is expected that the Scheme and the Demerger will become effective before the end of March 2010,
disclosure about the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group is included in this offering memorandum because the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group is currently part of the Cable & Wireless Group and will remain owned by
Cable & Wireless Communications Plc until the Demerger becomes effective. If the Demerger does not become
effective by the Demerger Long Stop Date, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group will remain owned by Cable
& Wireless Communications Plc indefinitely.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group subsidiaries will not guarantee the Notes and will be “Unrestricted
Subsidiaries” as defined in the section “Description of Notes” not subject to the restrictions of the indenture
governing the Notes.

**PRESENTATION OF INFORMATION**

Unless otherwise indicated, financial information in this document has been prepared in accordance with IFRS as
adopted by the European Union. It has been presented in Sterling unless otherwise stated. All unaudited financial
information in this document has been extracted without material adjustment from the Cable & Wireless Group’s
accounting records. Prospective investors should ensure that they read the whole of this document and not just
rely on key information or information summarised within it.

The financial information on the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group in “Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group
_Historical Financial Information” of this document for the three year periods ended 31 March 2009 and for the_
six month period ended 30 September 2009 has been audited. The financial information for the six month period
ended 30 September 2008 has not been audited. Unless otherwise specified, employee headcount figures in this
document are as at 30 September 2009.

**Use of Non-IFRS financial information**

Cable & Wireless Worldwide has identified certain measures that it believes will assist understanding of the
performance of the business. This approach is largely comparable with that used by Cable and Wireless plc, but
as the measures are not defined under IFRS they may not be directly comparable with other companies’ adjusted
measures. The non-IFRS measures are not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, any IFRS measures of
performance but management have included them as these are considered to be important comparables and key
measures used within the business for assessing performance and supporting the performance measures derived
in accordance with IFRS.

The following are the key non-IFRS measures identified by Cable & Wireless Worldwide:

    - **EBITDA: Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, LTIP charge, net other operating**
income/expense and exceptional items.

    - **Exceptional items: Material items which derive from individual events that fall within the ordinary**
activities of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group that are identified as exceptional items by virtue
of their size, nature or incidence.

    - **Operating Cash Flow: EBITDA less balance sheet capital expenditure and cash flow associated with**
exceptional items.

    - **Data, IP and Hosting revenue percentage: The proportion of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide**
Group’s total revenue that is derived from Data, IP and Hosting products.

    - **Gross margin: Revenue less cost of sales.**

    - **Gross margin percentage: Gross margin divided by total revenue.**

    - **Operating costs as a percentage of revenue: Operating costs (excluding cost of sales, LTIP and**
exceptionals) divided by total revenue.

    - **EBITDA margin percentage: EBITDA (as defined above) divided by total revenue.**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group notes that the above non-IFRS measures, in particular, EBITDA and
Operating Cash Flow, have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation
from, or as a substitute for analysis of, results of operations, as reported under IFRS. Some of these limitations
are:

    - they do not reflect all of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s cash expenditures or future
requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;

    - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s
working capital needs;

    - they do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or
principal payments, on the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s debt;

    - although depreciation and amortisation are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and
amortised will often have to be replaced in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash
requirements for such replacements;

    - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group’s statements of cash flows; and

A-2


-----

    - other companies in the telecommunications industry may calculate these measures differently than the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group does, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure.

As a result of these limitations, EBITDA and Operating Cash Flow should not be considered as a measure of
discretionary cash available to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group to invest in the growth of its business.
The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its IFRS
measures and using EBITDA and Operating Cash Flow measures only supplementally. See the sections entitled
“Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group Operating and Financial Review” and “Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group Historical Financial Information”.

**CABLE & WIRELESS WORLDWIDE GROUP RISK FACTORS**

_Until the Demerger Effective Time, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group will be a part of the Cable &_
_Wireless Group. The Demerger may not occur. An investment in the Notes to be issued in this offering involves a_
_high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors before purchasing the Notes in_
_addition to the other information contained in this offering memorandum. The risks and uncertainties the Issuer_
_describes below are not the only ones the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group faces. Additional risks and_
_uncertainties of which the Issuer is not aware or that it currently believes are immaterial may also adversely_
_affect the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of_
_the possible events described below occurs, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s business, operating_
_performance, financial condition prospects or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If_
_that happens, the Issuer may not be able to pay interest or principal on the Notes when due and you could lose_
_all or part of your investment._

_This offering memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The_
_Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these_
_forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in_
_this offering memorandum. See “Forward-Looking Statements”._

**Risks relating to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group**

**_The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group is dependent on substantial contracts with large customers and these_**
**_contracts may contain stringent performance criteria and high or unlimited liability limits and exposure to_**
**_customer credit risk_**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s contracts with its large customers tend to be long-term (generally
with an initial term of three to five years) and may include stringent performance criteria, with associated
liability, risk sharing (including, in some cases exclusivity and minimum commitment provisions) and
benchmarking clauses. In the event that the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group fails to satisfy these contractual
requirements, such customers may have the ability to claim compensation and/or, in the case of more serious
breaches of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s performance conditions, terminate the contract. Some
contracts contain uncapped indemnity and liability clauses. Where contracts contain benchmarking clauses that
permit the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s customers to benchmark the pricing of agreed upon services
against those offered by other providers in an appropriate peer comparison group, such provisions may lead to a
reduction in fees that the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group charges to customers.

The failure of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group to continue to satisfy its contractual obligations, a default
by such customers in their contractual obligations or the failure by the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group to
renew these contracts on acceptable commercial terms when they expire or any other event resulting in the loss
of a large customer could have a material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s business,
reputation, financial condition and/or operating results.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group also must effectively manage credit risk related to its customers,
principally related to payments under its long-term contracts. Credit risk is the risk of loss from obligor or
counterparty default. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s customers may default on their obligations to
the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons.
Country, regional and political risks are also components of credit risk. Rising delinquent payments and rising
rates of bankruptcy are often precursors of future write-offs and may require the Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group to increase its reserve for losses. Higher write-off rates and an increase in its loss reserve may adversely
affect the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s profitability.

Although the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has reporting systems and procedures in place which it
believes are appropriate and makes estimates to provide for credit losses in its outstanding portfolio of
receivables, these estimates may not be accurate. In addition, the information that the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group uses in managing its customer credit risk may be inaccurate or incomplete. Although the Cable
& Wireless Worldwide Group regularly reviews its credit exposure to specific clients and counterparties and to
specific industries, countries and regions that it believes may present credit concerns, default risk may arise from
events or circumstances that are difficult to foresee or detect. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group may also
fail to receive full information with respect to the credit risks of its customers.

A-6


-----

Although the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has devoted significant resources to develop its customer risk
management policies and procedures and expects to continue to do so in the future, its risk management
techniques may not be fully effective. Management of customer risk requires, among other things, policies and
procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events, and these policies and
procedures may not be fully effective.

**_Business improvement initiatives by the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group may not be successfully_**
**_implemented or achieve the intended results and acquisitions may not be successfully integrated_**

Since November 2005, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has undertaken a major turnaround programme,
centred on the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s strategy of focusing on serving large UK and international
users of telecommunications services. The turnaround programme is split into three major phases: integration,
recovery and transformation. Both the integration phase, in which Energis was integrated into the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group and the recovery phase, in which the business reduced complexity and improved the
cost base and quality of earnings have completed. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group now is concluding its
transformation phase, during which customer propositions and operational performance are intended to exceed
industry standards. In October 2008, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group acquired THUS Group plc, which
it is in the process of integrating into the existing Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group, to achieve, among other
things, significant cost synergies.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group historically has dedicated, and expects in the future to dedicate,
significant resources to drive the transformation of its business and to integrate acquired businesses.
Implementation of transformation and integration initiatives is complex, time-consuming and expensive and may
divert management attention and time from core business activities. Any failure of the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group to continue to execute its transformation plans effectively could have a material adverse effect
on the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s business, reputation, financial condition and/or operating results.

**_The funding requirements or obligations in respect of the defined benefit pension schemes may increase_**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group operates defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes for
its current and former UK and overseas employees. The funding position of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group’s defined benefit pension schemes will be affected by the investment performance of the pension funds’
investments, the life expectancy of the schemes’ members, changes in the actuarial assumptions used to assess
the pension schemes’ funding position, changes in the rate of inflation and interest rates, the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group’s financial position, as well as other changes in economic conditions.

Following the Demerger, the newly established Cable & Wireless Worldwide Retirement Plan is expected to
have a deficit. The deficit may increase or decrease depending on a number of factors, including changes to the
actuarial assumptions and market conditions. This may require the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group to
increase its cash contributions to the pension scheme in agreement with the trustee.

Furthermore, the trustee of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Retirement Plan and the trustee of the THUS Group
pension scheme each have the power to trigger the winding-up of the relevant scheme if the trustee resolves this
to be in the best interest of the members of the scheme as a whole. If the trustee were to use this power, the
participating employers would become liable by statute to make contributions to the pension scheme to remove
any deficit calculated on the more conservative, buy-out basis, enabling the trustee of the pension scheme to
purchase individual annuity policies for all members of the pension scheme.

The rules of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Retirement Plan also give the scheme actuary a wide power to
determine the contributions that the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group is required to make to the scheme. The
first triennial actuarial valuation of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Retirement Plan is due after the bulk
transfer-in of assets and liabilities and after the valuation date, which will be set in due course.

Following the valuation date, Cable & Wireless Worldwide will have, under statute, 15 months to agree such
valuation and any relevant contributions with the trustee of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Retirement Plan.
Cable & Wireless Worldwide expects that the first triennial valuation will be completed on a basis consistent
with the Pensions Regulator’s guidance that a recovery plan should be reasonably affordable. However, if the
pension trustee and Cable & Wireless Worldwide are unable to agree the amount and timing of the relevant
contribution by the date falling 15 months after the valuation date, the process would be referred to the Pensions
Regulator, who has certain powers to impose a specified rate of contribution upon, or make orders applying to,
Cable & Wireless Worldwide.

A-7


-----

Beyond that timeframe, changes to the funding position of the pension schemes in the longer term may lead to
the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group being required to contribute additional funding to satisfy pension
obligations (including any ongoing liability to the Cable & Wireless Communications defined benefit pension
schemes). This could have a material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s business,
reputation, financial condition and/or operating results.

**_The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s success depends on attracting and retaining highly skilled and_**
**_qualified management and employees and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group could suffer material_**
**_adverse effects if it fails to do so_**

The recruitment and retention of highly skilled management and employees is important to the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group’s success. The number of suitable employees at higher levels may be limited and key
employees, many of whom have significant experience within the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group and the
telecommunications sector, may be difficult to replace. There can be no certainty that the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group’s succession planning, retention policies and incentive plans will be successful in attracting
and retaining the right calibre of key employees. The failure to attract and retain key employees could have a
material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s business, reputation, financial condition
and/or operating results.

**_Failures or interruptions may affect the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s network and/or information_**
**_technology (IT) systems_**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s global networks are critical assets in providing its customers with
reliable and extensive telecommunications services. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group is reliant on its IT
systems for the operation and management of its business, including its networks, the provision of services to its
customers, customer billing and the provision of information regarding most aspects of its financial and
operational performance. Like other telecommunications operators, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s
networks and/or IT systems are vulnerable to interruption and damage from natural disasters, fire, security
breaches, software malfunction, terrorist action, power outages, human error or other factors outside its control.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has in place business continuity and disaster recovery plans, including
contingency equipment and suppliers, network monitoring and resilience plans. However, there can be no
certainty that such plans and systems will be effective in the event that they need to be activated. The failure or
interruption of all or part of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s network and/or IT systems would restrict
the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s ability to continue to operate at its current performance levels and may
result both in the loss of customers and potential exposure to claims from customers based on loss of service.
Should the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group experience problems with the integrity of its data and the
adequacy of some or all of the associated systems and processes, it could have an impact on its ability to provide
services and conduct its operations. Any insurance maintained to protect against certain of these risks may not be
adequate to cover any loss suffered by the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group, including lost revenue or
increased expenses. Each of these matters could have a material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group’s business, reputation, financial condition and/or operating results.

**_Some of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s customer contracts include clauses which could allow_**
**_termination in the event of a change of control including the Demerger, or could trigger guarantee obligations_**

Some of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s customer contracts include change of control clauses, which
may be triggered by the sale of a business within the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group to which the clauses
relate or certain types of corporate restructuring, including the Demerger. These change of control clauses may
restrict the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s strategic options, including any potential disposal of individual
businesses and, if triggered, may lead to some customers terminating their contracts with the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group. Whilst the transfer of these contracts is provided for in some of them, others will require the
consent of the relevant customer. Some contracts also contain guarantees provided by Cable and Wireless plc, in
relation to which the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group intends to engage with customers to seek their
removal, or replacement with a Cable & Wireless Worldwide guarantee. These change of control provisions and
guarantees, if triggered, could result in the termination or revocation of such contracts, which could have a
material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s business, reputation, financial condition
and/or operating results.

**_After the Demerger, use of the Cable & Wireless trademarks will be shared by both the Cable & Wireless_**
**_Worldwide Group and the Cable & Wireless Communications Group_**

The value of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s business depends, to a certain extent, upon its ability to
utilise the Cable & Wireless Trademarks. After the Demerger, both the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group and
the Cable & Wireless Communications Group will share the use of the “Cable & Wireless” name and have
ongoing rights to use the Cable & Wireless Trademarks.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group currently protects the Cable & Wireless Trademarks and its other
intellectual property rights through a variety of methods, including obtaining and maintaining registered
intellectual property rights, maintaining the confidentiality of valuable technical information and the enforcement
of its legal rights. Details of the ownership and rights to use the Cable & Wireless Trademarks are set out in the
section entitled “Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group Operating and Financial Review—Impact of the
_Demerger”._

Use of the Cable & Wireless Trademarks by the Cable & Wireless Communications Group could cause
diminution in their value. For example, the Cable & Wireless Trademarks could be damaged if they are used
inappropriately or in respect of goods or services of a poor quality, or if there are complaints, adverse publicity or
litigation affecting the Cable & Wireless Communications Group. It could also make it more difficult to enforce
intellectual property rights in the Cable & Wireless Trademarks against third parties, for example, if they are
used in a descriptive manner, or if the distinctiveness of the Cable & Wireless Trademarks is diluted due to
confusion among consumers. Consequently, both the value of the Cable & Wireless Trademarks to the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group, and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s business, could be negatively
affected by the use of the Cable & Wireless Trademarks by the Cable & Wireless Communications Group.

Prior to the Demerger Effective Time, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group will be granted rights under the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Licence to use the Cable & Wireless Trademarks in the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Territory, and, in relation to its Carrier Business and the acronym “CWW” only, anywhere in the
world. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group is also authorised to use the Cable & Wireless Trademarks
outside the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Territory for certain incidental uses and certain ‘grandfathered’ use on
existing materials. Under the terms of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide License, the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group is largely unrestricted in its use of the Cable & Wireless Trademarks within the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Territory but is restricted outside the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Territory as described in
the section entitled “Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group Business—Material Contracts”. Therefore, to the
extent the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has activities outside the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Territory
which are not part of its Carrier Business, it must, subject to these limited exceptions, operate under the acronym
“CWW” or trademarks other than the Cable & Wireless Trademarks. In addition the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group must cease use of the “Cable & Wireless Globe” logo after a transitional period. As both the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group and the Cable & Wireless Communications Group have certain rights across
the world to use the Cable & Wireless Trademarks in connection with their respective Carrier Businesses, this
could cause confusion among customers and potential customers, which could have a material adverse effect on
the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s business, reputation, financial condition and/or operating results.

Under the terms of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Licence, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group is
responsible, within the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Territory and, in relation to the acronym “CWW” only, also
outside the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Territory, for prosecuting applications for registration and maintaining
existing trademark registrations of the Cable & Wireless Trademarks at its own cost. The Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group could, through its own acts or omissions, fail to obtain the registration of trademark
applications, allow registered trademarks to lapse or allow registered trademarks to become subject to challenges
of invalidity (e.g. through non-usage of the registered trademark within the jurisdictions in the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Territory), thereby reducing the value of the Cable & Wireless Trademarks to the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group. This could have a material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s
business reputation, financial condition and/or operating results.

**_The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s ability to refinance its existing debt may be constrained_**

The Amended Cable & Wireless Worldwide Facility Agreement is due for repayment in 2013 and the
Convertible Bonds are due for repayment in 2014 if they have not been redeemed, purchased, and cancelled or
converted, following Demerger, into the relevant issuer’s ordinary shares prior to that date. The Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group does not need to refinance any of its existing debt until 2013, when the Amended
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Facility Agreement expires. Although the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group is

A-9


-----

not reliant on the refinancing of existing debt, should the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s financial
condition or general economic conditions at the relevant time prevent the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group
from successfully refinancing its existing debt, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group would have more limited
access to funds in the longer term to finance its investment in the development of the business, any potential
acquisitions and dividend payments. The failure to refinance its existing debt could also have a material adverse
effect on the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s business, reputation, financial condition and/or operating
results.

For further details on the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s existing debt facilities, refer to the section
entitled “Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group Operating and Financial Review—Liquidity and Capital
_Resources” of this document._

**_The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s debt obligations impose certain covenants on the Cable & Wireless_**
**_Worldwide Group_**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s credit facilities impose financial and other restrictive covenants that
limit the ability of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group to, among other things, borrow additional funds,
create security and/or, where there is a default under those credit facilities only, pay dividends. In addition, if the
Demerger is completed, Cable & Wireless Worldwide will become the principal debtor under the Convertible
Bonds. Subject to limited exceptions, the Convertible Bonds limit the issuance by certain members of the Cable
& Wireless Worldwide Group of secured capital markets indebtedness, which is capable of being listed (or the
giving of guarantees or indemnities in respect of secured capital markets indebtedness which is capable of being
listed) unless the benefit of such security guarantee or indemnity, or similar security, guarantee or indemnity is
extended to the Convertible Bonds or otherwise permitted in accordance with, and subject to, the terms of the
Convertible Bonds. Cable & Wireless Worldwide is not required to issue any such capital markets indebtedness
in the short term. In addition, the Convertible Bonds also contain anti-dilution provisions related to capital
distributions and extraordinary dividends which, subject to a threshold up to a specified yield in the case of
extraordinary dividends, will require a downward adjustment to the effective conversion price of the Convertible
Bonds on the making or paying of such distributions or dividends by Cable & Wireless Worldwide (see “Cable
_& Wireless Worldwide Group Business—Material Contracts” for further information on the Convertible Bonds_
negative pledge and anti-dilution provisions). In the longer term, Cable & Wireless Worldwide’s ability to pursue
growth opportunities and take advantage of potential investments may be constrained by such covenants.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s credit facilities are described in the section entitled “Cable &
_Wireless Worldwide Group Business—Material Contracts”._

**_The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group relies on third parties for certain services under outsourcing and_**
**_other contracts and these third parties may fail to provide the contracted services_**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has outsourced a number of back office activities to third parties, some
of whom are located in jurisdictions that may be subject to political instability and/or poor infrastructure. The
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has also entered into a Transitional Services Agreement with Cable &
Wireless Communications and Cable and Wireless plc pursuant to which each party provides the other with
certain services. The specified services include services in respect of the following: information technology, tax,
networks and other services to be agreed. In the event that such third parties fail to deliver their contracted
activities and the operations of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s customers are interrupted, this could
have a material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s business, reputation, financial
condition and/or operating results. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group may not be able to recover monies
paid to such third parties for their services or obtain contractual damages to which it may be entitled (if any) in
such an event.

In addition the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group is dependent on third party suppliers. For example, the Cable
& Wireless Worldwide Group has significant relationships with some suppliers for the provision of network
infrastructure, equipment and associated services. Certain of Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s supplier
contracts require it to use one supplier exclusively and/or to take delivery of a minimum specified amount of the
product made available by such supplier. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has also experienced and may
continue to experience an increased risk of supply chain partners entering administration or other insolvency
proceedings (including, without limitation, Nortel Networks), which if not successfully mitigated could lead to a
consequential impact on the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s ability to conduct its business in the ordinary
course. The terms of Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s supplier contracts may be onerous or uncommercial

A-10


-----

if circumstances change, which could have a material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group’s business, reputation, financial condition and/or operating results. In addition, the failure of a supplier to
deliver its goods or a disruption, delay or interruption in the supply chain or the loss of provision of a supplier’s
services could limit the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s ability to serve its customers and could have a
material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s business, reputation, financial condition
and/or operating results.

**_The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group may be adversely affected by complaints, litigation and publicity_**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group may be adversely affected by complaints and litigation, including from
customers, competitors or regulatory authorities, as well as any adverse publicity that the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group may attract. Any litigation, complaints or adverse publicity could have a material adverse
effect on the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s business, reputation, financial condition and/or operating
results.

**_The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group may be adversely affected by any failure to protect or any_**
**_infringement of its intellectual property rights and may infringe the proprietary intellectual property rights of_**
**_others_**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group cannot be certain that the steps that have been taken to protect its
intellectual property rights, including its trademarks, know-how and inventions, will be adequate or that third
parties will not infringe or misappropriate its intellectual property rights. There is also a risk that the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group may inadvertently infringe proprietary rights of others. In the communications
industry, the fast evolving technologies and know-how may increase the risk of such inadvertent violations by
third parties or by the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group. Any such infringement, or misappropriation of, its
intellectual property rights, or infringement by the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group of third parties’
intellectual property rights, could have a material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s
business, reputation, financial condition and/or operating results.

**_Third parties may gain access to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s network and/or highly sensitive_**
**_data unlawfully_**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group carries highly sensitive data across its networks globally on behalf of a
number of its customers. Despite security management across the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s
networks, there is a risk that third parties may gain access unlawfully to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group’s networks and/or this highly sensitive data. If data security on the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s
networks is compromised, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group customers may seek to claim compensation
for breach of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s contractual obligations or terminate their contracts with
the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group may also face regulatory
sanctions in respect of any such breach. Each of these matters could have a material adverse effect on the Cable
& Wireless Worldwide Group’s business, reputation, financial condition and/or operating results.

**_The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group is exposed to the risks of internal fraud or illegal activities by third_**
**_parties_**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group expects to maintain an effective system of internal controls after the
Demerger; however, any failure to implement such controls may result in the Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group not being able to report its financial results accurately or prevent fraud. Current and potential stakeholders
could therefore lose confidence in the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s financial reporting, which would
harm its business and the trading price of its securities. In addition, third parties may also utilise the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group’s communications networks for illegal activities which are beyond its control or
subject them to damage, theft or other loss. For example, hackers could use the Cable & Wireless Worldwide
broadband services to hack into websites and Internet accounts, or broadband users could download music
content illegally. Any such fraudulent or illegal activities could have a material adverse effect on the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group’s business, reputation, financial condition and/or operating results.

**_A number of estimates and assumptions have been used in the preparation of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide_**
**_Group’s consolidated financial statements_**

The preparation of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s consolidated financial statements requires
management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported

A-11


-----

amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. These estimates and associated assumptions are based on
historical experience and various other factors that are considered to be reasonable under the circumstances.
These estimates and assumptions form the basis of judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily available from other sources. Should the actual results differ from these estimates and
assumptions, this could have a material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s business,
reputation, financial condition and/or operating results.

**Risks relating to the telecommunications industry and market in which the Cable & Wireless Worldwide**
**Group operates**

**_The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group may suffer if British Telecom Group plc (BT) is not effectively_**
**_regulated_**

Like all major telecommunications operators in the United Kingdom, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group is
reliant on BT’s network to deliver some services to its customers. At the same time, BT is also the largest
provider of services directly to customers with at least 50% market share of the corporate market (based on the
BT first quarter 2008/09 results). As BT is both the main competitor and supplier to all major UK
telecommunications operators, BT’s role needs to be regulated carefully to ensure that a fair competitive
environment is maintained within the United Kingdom. Should the UK regulator, Ofcom, not regulate the
practices of BT adequately, leading to the other UK telecommunications operators, including the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group, not being able to compete effectively, this could have a material adverse effect on
the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s business, financial condition and/or operating results.

**_The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group may be adversely affected by poor local, national and worldwide_**
**_economic conditions_**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group derives a significant amount of its revenue from the United Kingdom
and therefore is sensitive to fluctuations in the UK economy, particularly its impact on the expenditure and the
financial health of large enterprises (affecting default rates and the willingness of such corporates to fund capital
investments). The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group also has some exposure to international markets, in
particular India and a number of other Asian markets, where some of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s
large customers have operations.

The recent global recession has affected the pattern of demand from some of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group’s customers. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has seen a lengthening of the sales cycle with large
corporate customers and the demand for voice minutes has also decreased as customers reduced their
discretionary expenditure. The economic conditions have also led to increased credit risk of existing customers as
well as increased incidence of customers seeking variations to payment terms.

Should the poor UK or global economic conditions or a recession continue or recur, and continue to affect the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s customers’ demand for its products, this could have a material adverse
effect on the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s business, financial condition and/or operating results.

**_Increases in energy prices, particularly electricity prices, could have a material adverse impact on the cost_**
**_base of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group_**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group is a significant user of power in its network and data centres. Energy
costs, primarily electricity, represented 2% of revenue in the financial year ended 31 March 2009. The Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group does not currently fully hedge its energy price exposures. Increases in energy prices,
particularly electricity prices, could have a material adverse impact on the cost base of the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and/or
operating results.

**_The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group may be adversely affected by changes to UK tax legislation or its_**
**_interpretation or increases in effective tax rates in the jurisdictions in which the Cable & Wireless Worldwide_**
**_Group operates_**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group operates in multiple jurisdictions and its profits are taxed according to
the tax laws of such jurisdictions. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s effective tax rate may be affected
by changes in, or interpretations of, tax laws in any given jurisdiction, including those relating to the utilisation

A-12


-----

of capital allowances, net operating losses and tax credit carry forwards, changes in geographical allocation of
income and expense, and changes in management’s assessment of matters such as the ability to realise deferred
tax assets. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s effective income tax rates in a given financial year reflect a
variety of factors that may not be present in the succeeding financial year or years.

In particular, as at 30 September 2009, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has a timing difference in respect
of UK capital allowances of approximately £3.8 billion, which is expected to be available as a deductible item to
offset profits generated by the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group under the terms of current UK tax legislation.

An adverse change to UK tax legislation, or its interpretation, relating to the usage of capital allowances or an
increase in the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s effective tax rate in future periods by any other means
could have a material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s financial condition and/or
operating results and specifically its net income, cash flow and earnings may decrease.

**_The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group relies on other telecommunications operators and is affected by the_**
**_behaviour of other market participants that it does not own or control_**

Parts of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s operations rely on access to networks that it does not own or
entirely control. In these cases, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s operations depend on network
operators to provide interconnection or transit services for the origination, carriage and/or termination of some of
its telecommunications services, such as traditional voice minutes, on acceptable commercial terms.

If the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group is unable to obtain and maintain the necessary interconnection and
other transmission services in a timely fashion and on acceptable commercial terms in each country in which
access to other telecommunications operators’ networks is required to introduce or continue to offer its
telecommunications services, this could have a material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group’s business, reputation, financial condition and/or operating results.

**_The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group may be adversely affected by unforeseen changes in regulation,_**
**_government policy and the economic or political environment in the countries in which the Cable & Wireless_**
**_Worldwide Group operates_**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s ability to provide telecommunications services depends in most
countries on government licences, telecommunications regulations and applicable laws in the markets in which it
operates. Compliance with these licences and applicable local laws will often require that the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group companies obtain consents or approvals from regulatory authorities for certain activities. The
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group operates in certain highly regulated markets, such as in the United Kingdom
and India, and its flexibility to manage its business can be constrained by regulation in these markets and the
strength of its relationships with relevant regulators and governments.

The regulatory regimes having jurisdiction over the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group may restrict its ability
to operate in or provide specified products or services in designated areas, or require that it maintain licences for
its operations and conduct its operations in accordance with prescribed standards, or adversely affect the
regulation of competition in the markets in which the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group operates.

Typically telecommunications licences, including some of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s licences,
contain extensive obligations with which the licencee is required to comply. These licences also typically include
provisions for the termination of the licences in specific circumstances, for example, on non-compliance with
licence conditions or in the general public interest.

Moreover, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group cannot guarantee that it will be successful in obtaining the
licences it needs to carry out its business strategy or in maintaining its existing licences. The loss of, or a material
limitation on, certain of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s licences could have a material adverse effect
on its business, reputation, financial condition and/or operating results.

The adoption of new laws or regulations or changes to the existing competition and regulatory framework could
also adversely affect the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s business. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group has no ability to predict with certainty whether the regulatory regimes to which it is subject or the laws or
regulations promulgated by the regulators having jurisdiction over it will change or whether such changes could
have a material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s business, reputation, financial
condition and/or operating results.

-----

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group may be subject to unexpected political, economic or legal
developments that affect telecommunications regulations and lead to it being unable to acquire or retain the
regulatory approvals necessary for its business. Future changes to regulation or a significant deterioration in the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s relationships with relevant regulators in the jurisdictions in which the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group operates may have a material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group. Failure to acquire and retain the necessary consents and approvals or in any other way to
comply with regulatory requirements or, alternatively, the costs to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group of
complying with new or more onerous regulations and restrictions, could have a material adverse effect on the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s business, reputation, financial condition and/or operating results.

**_Technological changes in communication and information technology may render the Cable & Wireless_**
**_Worldwide Group’s products, services and supporting infrastructure obsolete or uncompetitive_**

The telecommunications industry is subject to rapid changes in technology, some of which may be significant .
Despite the strength of its existing networks and its investment in product development and the business’
supporting infrastructure, it is not possible to predict with certainty the effect of future technological changes on
the industry and on the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s individual businesses. As technology evolves, the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group may need to obtain new and/or additional regulatory licences, or make
significant investments to upgrade its infrastructure to new technologies if, for example, Internet access migrates
to wireless technology. Competitors may also acquire rights to newer and more competitive technologies not
available to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group. Additionally, should items of mechanical and electrical
network infrastructure remain in use beyond their anticipated service life, these assets may present a risk to
service. Any such events could have a material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s
business, reputation, financial condition and/or operating results.

**_The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group may fail to compete effectively in the competitive markets in which it_**
**_operates_**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group faces competition in all its areas and markets. Certain of the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group’s competitors may have greater financial, marketing or other resources, which may
allow them to provide services more effectively and at a lower cost than the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group.
These competitors, or potential competitors from other territories who choose to enter the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group’s market, may adopt more aggressive pricing policies, undertake more extensive advertising
and marketing campaigns or successfully replicate or impact the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s business
model. The telecommunications sector in the markets in which the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group operates
may experience further consolidation, which could result in, among other things, competitors with greater scale
operating aggressively in these markets.

As the markets for some of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s services expand in certain locations,
additional competition may emerge in the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s key markets, including the UK,
and existing competitors may commit more resources to the markets in which such competitors participate. The
impact of increased competition in the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s markets or failure of the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group’s business, reputation, financial condition and/or operating results.

**_The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group may not accurately forecast demand for its cable systems_**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group invests in global cable consortiums connecting many countries across
the world. Should the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group not accurately forecast demand in relation to its
infrastructure, investments or for capacity within a cable consortium this could result in asset impairment charges
and have a material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s business, reputation, financial
condition and/or operating results.

**_Demand for next-generation, IP-based, services may not grow as quickly as anticipated_**

In the business telecommunications market, demand is moving away from traditional services carried over
multiple networks towards next-generation, IP-based services carried over a single network. The Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group has already deployed its next-generation network, an IP-based network and MultiService Platform, over which it is providing its services, such as Fixed Mobile Convergence. These IP-based
services are less commoditised than traditional services and therefore currently provide better margins. If demand

-----

for these services does not grow as quickly as anticipated or these products become commoditised more quickly
than anticipated, this could have a material adverse effect on the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s business,
reputation, financial condition and/or operating results.

**_Concerns about perceived or actual health risks related to wireless devices and facilities could have an adverse_**
**_effect on the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group_**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group provides mobile services within its Fixed Mobile Convergence product
and uses other wireless devices as part of its networks. Research and studies into the health risks posed by mobile
telephone handsets and radio transmission facilities are continuing. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group
reviews scientific and medical research, and studies media, legal, regulatory and other developments, as well as
the public perception of risk arising from the use of such equipment.

New research and/or increased speculation regarding health risks associated with mobile telephone handsets and
radio transmission facilities or any subsequent substantiation of such risks could have an adverse impact on the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s customer numbers or customers’ usage of mobile and/or radio devices or
could expose the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group to litigation, regulatory intervention and/or new
legislation, each of which could materially adversely affect the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s business,
reputation, financial condition and/or operating results.

**_The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s operations, facilities, products and employees are subject to a wide_**
**_range of health and safety regulations and concerns_**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group is subject to certain environmental, health and safety laws and
regulations that affect its operations, facilities, products and employees in each of the jurisdictions in which it
operates. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with
applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations related to its operations, facilities, products,
employees and business activities and has adequate measures in place to ensure that its affiliates, vendors and
contractors comply with all environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. However, in spite of these
measures, there is a risk that the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group may have to incur expenditures to cover
environmental and health liabilities to maintain compliance with current or future environmental, health and
safety laws and regulations or to undertake any necessary remediation.

In addition, certain employees or contractors of Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group may be required to work
under extreme or dangerous conditions (for example, heights or weather) or in extreme or dangerous locations.
Although the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group complies in all material respects with applicable health and
safety laws and regulations related to its operations, facilities, products, employees and business activities, it is
subject to potentially material liabilities, including those related to personal injuries or property damage, that may
result from working under extreme or dangerous conditions or in extreme or dangerous locations.

services for large users of telecommunications. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group provides high quality
managed voice, data, applications and Internet Protocol (IP) based services to its customers, focusing on serving
large corporates, multinational companies, governments, carrier customers and telecommunications resellers.
Small and medium sized enterprises are served indirectly via telecommunications resellers and directly through
the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s Thus brand.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has an extensive telecommunications network. The majority of its
operations, and its headquarters, are in the United Kingdom, where it owns the country’s biggest fibre network
dedicated to business users of telecommunications. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group also has a
substantial global telecommunications network, totalling approximately 500,000km in length, including interests
in 69 major global cable systems. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s next-generation network, across
which all services provided by the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group can be delivered, improves the quality
and performance of telecommunications services through its use of advanced optical and IP transmission. The
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has a Multi-Service Platform that operates across its fibre infrastructure and
offers a single environment for their telecommunications requirements, which reduces costs for both customers
and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group and provides the platform for innovative new applications. With 127
points of presence in 35 countries, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group provides connectivity to 153

In the six months ended 30 September 2009, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group generated revenue of
£1,141 million and EBITDA of £205 million. EBITDA has grown by 99% per annum since the six months ended
30 September 2006. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group aims to continue growing by being the first choice
communications integrator specialising in the mission critical needs of large users of telecommunications who
rely on the communication infrastructure and services provided by the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group to
operate their businesses.

The Directors believe that the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s network and continuous development of an
advanced product suite, together with positive customer experience for customers, position it to be able to
capitalise on the trends being experienced in its markets. These include the need to reduce business complexity
through the adoption of next-generation network infrastructure and applications; the demand for voice and data
products, alongside the demand for advanced next-generation technologies, that can enable new business models;
and globalisation, in particular increasing telecommunications traffic between Asia, Europe and the United
States.

**HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT**

Cable & Wireless is one of the world’s leading international communications companies. For more than 130
years Cable & Wireless has provided telecommunications services, networks and equipment to business,
government and residential customers around the world. Cable & Wireless traces its history to a number of
British telegraph companies founded by Sir John Pender in the 1860s. In 1866, a Pender-led consortium laid the
first submarine cable across the Atlantic Ocean using Brunel’s ship, the “Great Eastern”. The Great Eastern also
laid the cable from Bombay to Porthcurno in the far south west of England in 1870, the first cable into what
subsequently became, for a period, the biggest cable station in the world. Following this success, further
submarine cables were laid from the United Kingdom to the Caribbean, Asia, Australia and the United States.

A-16


-----

With the development of wireless telegraphy, the Eastern and Associated Telegraph Company expanded its
interests by merging with the Wireless Telegraph Company founded by Marconi in 1929 to form the Imperial
and International Communications Company. This merger led to the formation of the biggest wireless and cable
company in the world and the company was renamed Cable & Wireless Limited in 1934.

During World War II, Cable & Wireless’ communications network played a vital strategic role and following the
war the company was nationalised acknowledging the vital importance of the international communications
infrastructure. Cable & Wireless became the international communications business of the British Post Office.

Cable & Wireless was one of the first privatisations of the Thatcher government with the initial sale of 49% of
Cable & Wireless in 1981. The remaining 51% was offered to the public in two tranches in 1983 and 1985. In
1981, Mercury Communications was created within the Cable & Wireless Group as a competitor to BT to
provide fixed line telecommunications services in the United Kingdom. In 1993, One2One, a Mercury
Communications division, launched mobile communications to the UK consumer market. In 1997, Mercury
merged with several UK telecommunications operators and was renamed Cable & Wireless Communications
(CW Communications); Cable & Wireless owned a 53% stake in CW Communications. Following the Mercury
merger, Cable & Wireless initiated a significant disposal programme, which included the following disposals: of
the Cable & Wireless Group’s stake in One2One to Deutsche Telekom in 1999, its CW Communications
consumer operations stake to NTL in 2000, its Hong Kong Telecom stake to PCCW in 2000 and its Australian
Optus stake to Singapore Telecom in 2001. At the same time, the Cable & Wireless Group began developing its
business around a global IP network with a strategy to sell global IP services and build its hosting expertise.

In 2003, Sir Richard Lapthorne was appointed as Chairman to lead a turnaround of the business following a
downturn in financial performance. This turnaround included resolving a significant tax issue relating to its disposal
of the Cable & Wireless Group’s stake in One2One, the sale of the Japanese business and the exit from the lossmaking US operations. In 2004, Cable & Wireless successfully competed for the opportunity to purchase a stake in
Monaco Telecom. The following year, in a transformational move, Cable & Wireless bought Energis, an acquisition
which strengthened Cable & Wireless’ position in the United Kingdom. In 2006, Cable & Wireless internally
re-structured into two standalone divisions—Cable & Wireless International (since renamed the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group) and Cable & Wireless Europe, Asia & US (EAUS) (since renamed the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group).

In 2008, Cable & Wireless completed the purchase of THUS Group plc, a UK telecommunications group. The
integration of Thus is ongoing and a new company, Thus Limited, has been set up as a stand-alone business
within the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group focused on offering a full suite of advanced business
communications to small and medium sized enterprises.

In November 2009, the Cable and Wireless plc Board announced its intention to separate the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group, reflecting its belief that the businesses had
reached a position where they would deliver increased value to shareholders as separately listed companies. The
separation is the culmination of work which began in April 2006, when Cable and Wireless plc created two
largely distinct operating units under the Cable and Wireless plc umbrella to reflect their differing characteristics
and the establishment of clear strategies for both. As a result of the significant progress made since then, the
Cable and Wireless plc Board considers that the two businesses have now put in place the necessary
arrangements to operate as independent, publicly-quoted businesses.

The Cable and Wireless plc Board believes that the separation will deliver further value for shareholders by:

    - allowing the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group and the Cable & Wireless Communications Group to
pursue their strategies independently with greater flexibility over management of resources and
opportunities;

    - creating two separately listed companies with distinct investment profiles and clear market valuations;

    - sharpening management focus further, helping the two businesses maximise their performance; and

    - providing a transparent capital structure and an efficient balance sheet for each business.

**MARKET OVERVIEW**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group serves large users of telecommunications in the UK, its largest market,
as well as in Asia-Pacific, India, the Middle East, Africa, Continental Europe and the United States.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group divides its operations into three categories: the UK telecommunications
market, the global telecommunications market and the carrier market.

**The UK telecommunications market**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group divides the UK telecommunications market into two customer
groupings: UK enterprise and mid-market.

    - _UK enterprise. Includes large corporate customers, public sector customers and system integrators. For_
the six months ended 30 September 2009, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s UK enterprise
group had revenue of £617 million and a gross margin of £343 million, which were 54% and 64% of
the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s total revenue and total gross margin respectively.

    - _Mid-market. Includes small and medium sized enterprises whether served directly through the Cable &_
Wireless Worldwide Group’s reseller brand Thus or indirectly through resellers. For the six months
ended 30 September 2009, the mid-market group had revenue of £173 million and a gross margin of
£62 million, which were 15% and 12% of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s total revenue and
total gross margin respectively.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group estimates that, in 2010, the UK enterprise market will spend
approximately £9 billion on telecommunications services, comprising of approximately £5.5 billion for
traditional voice and data services, approximately £1.5 billion for hosting services and approximately £2 billion
for new applications, including network-based applications and Fixed Mobile Convergence products. The Cable
& Wireless Worldwide Group estimates that this market is growing at approximately 1% per annum, with growth
in Data, IP and Hosting offsetting declines in traditional voice services. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group
estimates that the hosting services market will grow at approximately 5% per annum in the short to medium term.

The UK enterprise telecommunications market remains highly competitive, with a number of operators having
invested in networks, resulting in strong competition, particularly in traditional voice and data services. See the
section entitled “Competitive Landscape” below. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group competes in the UK
enterprise market with a range of product offerings, including wide area networks, Voice Services and Hosting. In
addition, the desire of UK companies to look for additional ways to reduce costs and make business processes and

A-18


-----

operating models more efficient has led to an increase in demand for new IP-based applications, which in turn has
driven demand for bandwidth (network capacity) and increased hosting and data storage services. In response to this
demand, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has developed IP-based applications for customers as part of its
core product set, which has reduced the effect of the economic downturn on the Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group. These include applications such as Managed Video Conferencing, Fixed Mobile Convergence and Managed
Email. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group currently provides international services to about 40% of its UK
multinational customers and aims to increase this percentage in the future.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group also supplies telecommunications services to resellers in the United
Kingdom, who in turn sell services to end-users. This provides an indirect channel, primarily focused on small
and medium sized enterprises, but also on retail consumers, that adds volume to its network. In the past, resellers
principally purchased voice products, but, increasingly, are purchasing data products as these become more
important to their end customers. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group also serves small and medium sized
enterprises directly through the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s reseller brand Thus. Gross margin
percentage is higher (at 56%) for directly served customers than for indirectly (at 23%). The Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group estimates that, in 2009, the UK small and medium sized enterprise market spent
approximately £5 billion on telecommunications services.

**The global telecommunications market**

For the six months ended 30 September 2009, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s global enterprise
category had revenue of £81 million and a gross margin of £36 million, which was 7% and 7% of each of the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s total revenue and total gross margin (excluding international service to
UK multinationals).

Other than in the United Kingdom, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has operations in the Asia-Pacific
region, India, the Middle East and Africa, Continental Europe and the United States. In 2006, the global market for
next-generation data services to enterprise customers was approximately US$64 billion, and, in 2009, it is forecast
to have grown to approximately US$98 billion (Source: Gartner: Enterprise Network Services, Worldwide, 200613). The market is expected to continue to grow, with the compound annual growth rate for global next-generation
business data services to enterprise customers expected to be 9% between 2009 and 2013, with the size of the
market reaching approximately US$139 billion (Source: Gartner: Enterprise Network Services, Worldwide, 200613). The strongest growth in the global telecommunications market is occurring in emerging markets, reflecting the
growth of these economies and the increasing development of their infrastructure and demand for high quality
telecommunications services. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has access to a number of these higher
growth markets through its operations in India, China and other countries in the Asia-Pacific region, the Middle
East and Africa.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group believes multinational companies are securing relationships with a
smaller number of suppliers rather than multi-sourcing across international operations. In addition, multinational
companies increasingly are demanding managed services to help them address their business goals, which the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group, with its international network, can provide.

**The carrier market**

For the six months ended 30 September 2009, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group carrier category had
revenues of £270 million and a gross margin of £92 million, which were 24% and 17% of the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group’s total revenue and total gross margin, respectively. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group
offers services to carriers both in the United Kingdom and internationally.

In the United Kingdom, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group provides voice services to other
telecommunications operators, which either terminate on the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s network or
on the network of another carrier using the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s interconnection network. The
value of this market has declined recently due to regulatory changes to non-geographic numbers and mobile
termination rates. Data services are also sold to other telecommunications operators. The Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group estimates that, in 2009, the UK carrier market spent approximately £4 billion on
telecommunications services and that the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group is the second largest provider.

Internationally, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group provides voice and data services to other international
telecommunications operators, in particular making use of its global telecommunications network to transport
voice and data traffic to and from the United Kingdom. In addition, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group

A-19


-----

provides data services in the United Kingdom to other international carriers wishing to provide service to their
customers without investing in an owned network. Globalisation is expected by the Directors to drive further
growth in this market.

**Competitive landscape**

In the United Kingdom, the principal competitor to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group is BT. The Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group competes with BT in more than two-thirds of the corporate contract tenders that it
enters. During the past three years, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has increased its success rate in
tenders and increased its market share from 13% prior to the Energis acquisition to approximately 19% for
enterprise voice, data and hosting services. Several other companies compete with the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group in the United Kingdom market, including Global Crossing, Verizon, Colt, KCOM, Virgin
Media and Carphone Warehouse. The Directors believe that the combination of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group’s extensive network, leading product suite, focus on large users of telecommunications and its servicebased approach differentiates it from its UK competitors.

Internationally, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group competes with a number of global operators, including
AT&T, BT, France Telecom and Verizon, as well as various regional operators, including NTT, Reliance
Globalcom and Singapore Telecom. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group differentiates itself in its
international markets with its regional focus, network capability, advanced IP-based propositions and strong
focus on customer service and the strength of its relationships with UK multinational companies.

**PRODUCT OFFERINGS**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group categorises its product offerings in the telecommunications markets
into three types: Data, IP and Hosting, Traditional Voice and Legacy products.

**Data, IP and Hosting**

For the six months ended 30 September 2009, £592 million, or 52% of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s
total revenue, was derived from Data, IP and Hosting services.

Data, IP and Hosting consists of a number of core products:

    - _Wide area networks: The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group provides direct connectivity between_
customer sites on either a point-to-point basis or via a wide area network at speeds from less than
2Mbps to 10Gbps. These are provided in the UK and globally and utilise both IP Virtual Private
Networks and Ethernet technology.

    - _Local area networks: The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s local area network solutions provide_
connectivity within a customer’s physical location.

    - _Local loop unbundling: The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group utilises its 802 unbundled exchanges_
in the United Kingdom to provide data and voice services directly to its own customers and also via
resellers.

    - _Hosting: The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group offers a range of hosting products that utilise the_
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s data centres, which have 205,000 square feet of hosting space
and are based in the UK and the Republic of Ireland and are connected to the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group’s fibre network. Services offered include co-location, server and website hosting,
storage and security. For the six months ended 30 September 2009, £92 million, or 8% of the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group’s total revenue, was derived from hosting services. Of the hosting service
total revenue, 26% was for co-location services and 74% was for managed hosting services. Over the
same period, hosting services had £63 million of gross margin. Hosting revenue and gross margin have
grown at, on average, 30% and 28% per annum, respectively, since the six months ended 30 September
2006.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group also provides a number of applications that combine elements of these
core products to provide business services. IP voice is included in this category given its reliance on data
networks. Other examples of applications include:

    - _Managed Video Conferencing: Managed Video Conferencing is delivered over the Cable & Wireless_
Worldwide Group’s global Multi-Service Platform and next-generation network. The solution includes
a next-generation bridging application (Virtual Presence) that connects multiple devices and media into
a single simplified video conferencing service.

-----

    - _Fixed Mobile Convergence: Fixed Mobile Convergence provides customers with an integrated fixed_
and mobile solution giving the flexibility of mobile telephony with the lower cost of a fixed line phone.
FMC provides an in-building mobile network using small Global System for Mobile Communications
network cells (pico-cells) owned by the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group, which in combination
with a roaming agreement in the United Kingdom, allows mobile users to benefit from lower costs
(estimated at 25% to 35%) and an integrated service. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group
currently offers this service only in the United Kingdom.

    - _Managed Email: Managed Email combines the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s managed_
services for hosting, security and storage and network infrastructure with commercial software to offer
customers a high-quality messaging infrastructure.

**Traditional Voice Services**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s traditional voice revenue in the six months ended 30 September 2009
was £527 million, or 46% of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s total revenue.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group provides a range of voice services to retail and wholesale customers,
including:

    - _Lines and Calls: The provision of either a line connection or calls or both to end users who are either_
the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s own customers or those of a reseller customer. This service
can be provided either on the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s own infrastructure (direct
connection) in which case all aspects of the service, including line and feature rentals and call charges,
are billed by the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group or over a line provided by another carrier in
which case the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group bills for call charges and may or may not bill for
line and feature rentals.

    - _Telebusiness (inbound call management): The provision of call-routing, revenue share and_
management services for non-geographic numbers, such as 0800, 0844 or premium rate lines that are
used by customers for a variety of purposes, including, for example, call centres or TV voting.

    - _Voice Transit and Interconnect: The provision of voice capacity to carry minutes originated by other_
carriers, either to terminate with the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s customers or to terminate
with other carriers taking advantage of Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s extensive voice
interconnect network. This includes calls originating in the UK from fixed and mobile operators as well
as internationally.

**Legacy Services**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s revenue from legacy products in the six months ended 30 September
2009 was £22 million, or 2% of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s total revenue. The Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group reports several services as legacy as the platforms and products are nearing the end of their
life. These include data products (point-to-point links and wide area networks) utilising the Asynchronous
**Transfer Mode and Frame Relay protocols and internet service providers supporting dial-up internet access.**

**Service Propositions**

Each of the above-described products are offered to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s customers
individually or as a combination, together with a proposition that offers three levels of service model:

    - _Standard Service: standard products with standard support and service level agreements, supported_
from a shared service customer centre with common access to corporate monitoring and incident
management teams. This service model represented 52% of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s
total gross margin for the six months ended 30 September 2009.

business. Typically, these solutions will require transfer of ownership of network infrastructure, risk
and/or people. This service model represented 16% of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s total
gross margin for the six months ended 30 September 2009.

Each service proposition is provided with support 24 hours a day, seven days a week from centres based in
Europe and Asia, offering first line response for initial call handling and early diagnosis of faults through to
technical support, shared and dedicated service teams and technology specialists.

**STRENGTHS**

The Directors believe the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s principal competitive strengths are as follows:

**Focus on large users of telecommunications**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s strategy is to focus on large users of telecommunications in its
markets, with a particular strength in the industry sectors of retail, financial services, utilities, government and
media, where companies are highly dependent on communications infrastructure. The strategy enables
management to focus on delivering specific products and services for its customers that address their need to
simplify communications, reduce costs and enable new business models. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group believes that the critical nature of these contracts, which typically require close integration within the
customer’s business and are often long-term, continues to contribute to the increasing quality of Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group’s revenue.

**Next-generation network and delivery platform**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group owns the UK’s biggest fibre network dedicated to business users of
telecommunications and has an international cable network that provides connectivity to 153 countries, either
directly or through partners, that reaches across the Atlantic Ocean, through Europe and on to India and
throughout Asia. These networks have inbuilt resilience with capability to re-route traffic across diverse paths in
the event of failure of one or more paths and, especially at the international level, the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group believes this is a significant advantage over many competitors.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s Multi-Service Platform is an IP-based next-generation platform that
operates across the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s next-generation infrastructure and offers customers a
single environment for their telecommunications requirements. It provides the capability to integrate customer
voice and data applications closely with the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s network. The Directors
believe that the platform can be managed at a significantly lower cost for the Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group than for legacy infrastructures.

**Customer service**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has put customer service at the heart of its strategy and seeks to
establish a close relationship with its customers and a detailed understanding of their business challenges.

Many of the products and services the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group offers are typically in constant use by
their customers and tightly integrated into their operational activity. A deep understanding of the ways in which
they are used, how they contribute to the success of customers’ business and how they might be further
developed to generate additional value is one of the ways in which the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group
believes it differentiates itself and its customer service offering. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group
operates teams of sector, service and technical specialists to ensure it has the capability to meet not only its
contractual service commitments but also to deliver an enhanced level of customer service that contributes to the
quality of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s revenues and the depth of its customer relationships.

**Product suite**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group offers a wide range of products and services focusing on advanced
IP-based solutions that help customers achieve their business objectives. This suite of products enables customers
to build a package of telecommunications solutions that address customer business requirements. The Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group’s next-generation network and Multi-Service Platform have enabled the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group to bring new high-quality next-generation products to market, such as Managed
Video Conferencing, digital signage and voice recognition products.

A-22


-----

In the six months ended 30 September 2009, more than half of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s revenue
was generated from the Data, IP and Hosting product suite with higher margins than traditional voice and data
products. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group expects this trend to continue.

**Management team**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide management team is led by John Pluthero and Jim Marsh. Since their arrival
in November 2005 they have led the turnaround of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group. The Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group’s business has been restructured to focus on higher margin products and services
whilst costs have been significantly reduced. For both the financial year ended 31 March 2009 and the six months
ended 30 September 2009, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group was profitable and generated positive
operating cash flow.

John Pluthero and Jim Marsh are supported by strong management and employees throughout the business who
are focused on providing exceptional customer service.

**Brand strength**

Cable & Wireless has a strong, recognised brand under the Cable & Wireless Trademarks, which has been used
for more than 70 years. Post-Demerger, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group will have rights to continue to
use the Cable & Wireless Trademarks in the areas where it currently operates. For more information about the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s rights to use the Cable & Wireless Trademarks, see “—Material
_Contracts”. The Directors consider the Cable & Wireless Trademarks particularly strong in the United Kingdom_
and the Asia-Pacific markets, where Cable & Wireless has been operating for many years.

**STRATEGY**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group aims to be the first choice communications integrator specialising in the
mission critical needs of large users of telecommunications. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s
customers rely on the telecommunications infrastructure and services provided by the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group in order to operate their businesses.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group aims to achieve this objective by implementing the following strategy:

(a) working closely with its customers and differentiating itself through a tiered customer service model that is
‘right first time’, stable, proactive, responsive, and positions the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group as
‘easy to do business with’;

(b) continuing to evolve a market-leading product suite of advanced network-based services and solutions,
which is attractive to the large users of telecommunications, focused on its next-generation network and
Multi-Service Platform technology;

(c) increasing the share of revenue generated by its strategic product set of Data, IP and application services,
which attract higher margins and are in greater demand than products such as traditional voice and legacy
services;

(d) continuing to expand its network and technologies to improve both margin and capability to meet customer
demand, both in the United Kingdom and in its global footprint;

(e) maintaining its focus on efficiency in its network and service operations;

(f) increasing focus on emerging markets in Asia Pacific, India and the Middle East and Africa to capitalise on
increasing global demand; and

(g) leveraging its scale and product capability in the small and medium sized enterprise sector through the Thus
brand.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group believes that implementation of this strategy will enable the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group to deliver long-term growth in earnings and cash flow.

The market for the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s core Data, IP and Hosting products and services in the
United Kingdom and overseas is expected to continue to grow. Furthermore, the demand for telecommunications
services from enterprises in the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s target emerging markets is expected to
experience significant growth, and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group currently has only a small market

A-23


-----

share in the global enterprise market. The Directors believe that the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s
extensive UK and global network, together with its product suite and service focus positions it to successfully
exploit these growing markets and to build on its track record of increasing market share in the UK and overseas.
The Directors further believe that the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s proven ability to manage costs and
focus on operational efficiencies underpin the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s attractive outlook for
earnings and cash flow.

and Montreal.

**REGULATION**

Telecommunications is a regulated industry; the nature and scope of regulatory obligations applicable to the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group and to its competitors can have a significant impact on its business. This
includes making sure the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group complies with regulation in all jurisdictions in
which it operates. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group, therefore, monitors and participates in the regulatory
process, with a view to protecting its interests and ensuring it can both continue to develop its product and
service capability, and serve its customers efficiently and effectively. For a description of the risk of regulatory
changes, see “Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group Risk Factors—Risks relating to the telecommunications
_industry and market in which Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group operates” of this document._

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group holds licences or authorisations in 23 separate jurisdictions and
generally works with partners to deliver services to other countries. In the United Kingdom, the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group holds various licences to use radio spectrum for fixed link and mobile services and,

A-24


-----

in addition, it is authorised to offer a full suite of telecommunications services. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group also holds licences or authorisations to operate in all major European markets, the United States, Canada
and major Asian markets, such as India, Singapore and Hong Kong. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group
also maintains many industry quality standards including ISO27001 (information security management standard),
BS25999 (business continuity standard) and for the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland, ISO9001 (quality
assurance standard).

**PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has a property portfolio of approximately 4.1 million square feet of
freehold and leasehold technical and office space, located primarily in the United Kingdom, although the spread
of properties extends across Continental Europe, the United States and Asia. Numerically, the bulk of properties
are technical and house equipment necessary to support the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s operations
world wide.

The majority of the existing portfolio is leased. All of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s technical
properties in the United Kingdom enjoy the protection of telecommunications legislation, which has the aim of
ensuring the continuity of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s networks.

Over the last few years, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has been reducing the size of its property
portfolio to match its business rationalisation. Where possible the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has exited
or disposed of properties it no longer requires. Where it is not possible to exit or dispose of a property that is no
longer required by the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group, future lease obligations have been provided in full.
Whilst disposals are being pursued across the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group as part of these projects,
acquisition of both office and technical sites still occurs to support business growth.

Other than property, the tangible fixed assets of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group mainly comprises
network and technical equipment, none of which is individually material.

**MATERIAL LITIGATION**

There are no governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings (including any such proceedings which are pending
or threatened of which Cable & Wireless Worldwide is aware), during a period covering at least the previous
twelve months which may have, or have had in the recent past, significant effects on Cable & Wireless
Worldwide, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group and/or the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s financial
position or profitability.

**MATERIAL CONTRACTS**

Save as set out below, there are no contracts, not being contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business,
and which are or may be material:

(i) which have been entered into by members of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group within the two years
immediately preceding the date of this document; or

(ii) which have been entered into by members of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group and which contain
any provision under which any such member has any obligation or entitlement which is material to the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group as at the date of this document:

**Finance Arrangements**

**_Cable & Wireless Worldwide Facility Agreement_**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has obtained financing pursuant to the terms of a credit agreement
originally dated 5 December 2008, amended and restated by an amendment agreement dated 16 March 2009 (the
**Cable & Wireless Worldwide Facility Agreement). The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Facility Agreement is**
between, among others, Cable & Wireless Worldwide Holdings as borrower (the Borrower), and various
financial institutions listed therein as lenders (the Lenders), agent and security agent and issuing bank.

The parties to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Facility Agreement entered into a further deed of amendment
dated 14 January 2010 to amend and restate the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Facility Agreement (the Amended
**Cable & Wireless Worldwide Facility Agreement). The Amended Cable & Wireless Worldwide Facility**
Agreement will come into effect on the date of Admission of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Ordinary Shares
following the Demerger (the Facility Completion Date).

A-25


-----

Pursuant to the Amended Cable & Wireless Worldwide Facility Agreement the Borrower will have available, as
of the Facility Completion Date, £300 million by way of a multicurrency revolving credit facility for general
corporate purposes, up to £100 million of which may be utilised by letters of credit (the Facilities). The Facilities
also contemplate that the Borrower may enter into permitted bilateral facilities with the Lenders of up to
£75 million, subject to certain conditions (the Permitted Bilateral Facilities).

The Facilities and the Permitted Bilateral Facilities are guaranteed by the material subsidiaries of the Borrower
and Cable & Wireless Worldwide will become a guarantor on the Facility Completion Date. A stand-alone
guarantee given by Cable and Wireless plc will be released on the Facility Completion Date. The Lenders and the
lenders under the Permitted Bilateral Facilities also share pari passu in the security package, which comprises
fixed charges over the shares in each obligor and a floating charge over the assets of each obligor.

Loans made under the Amended Cable & Wireless Worldwide Facility Agreement will bear interest at a floating
rate per annum based on the relevant interbank rate plus a margin of 3.5% per annum. A fee is payable on each
letter of credit issued, which is equal to the margin.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Facility Agreement terminates on the earlier of the third anniversary of the
Facility Completion Date and 31 March 2012 (extended to 31 March 2013 under the Amended Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Facility Agreement) at which point all loans need to be repaid in full. Loans under the Facilities are
prepayable at par at any time at the Borrower’s option plus break costs. The Facilities are also mandatorily
prepayable on the occurrence of a change of control, illegality of a Lender and using the proceeds of disposals
and insurance claims, subject to exceptions.

The Amended Cable & Wireless Worldwide Facility Agreement contains a number of representations given by
the Borrower and the guarantors in respect of themselves and their subsidiaries, some of which must be true at
the signing date and then the Demerger and on each drawing. The Amended Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Facility Agreement also contains a number of financial covenants that are tested on a semi-annual basis looking
at the previous 12 months.

The Amended Cable & Wireless Worldwide Facility Agreement includes covenants to provide the agent with
each obligor’s audited annual financial statements, the Borrower’s half-yearly financial information provided for
its interim announcement and on a 6-monthly basis, a report on the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s
performance. Those financial statements need to be accompanied by a compliance certificate, which includes a
list of the material subsidiaries of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group and which, on an annual basis, is
separately confirmed by the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s auditors. The Borrower is required to give the
Agent written notice of a number of other events including material litigation and any default under the Amended
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Facility Agreement.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Facility Agreement includes other customary covenants, such as compliance
with laws, authorisations, maintenance of existence, payment of taxes, pension compliance and maintenance of
insurance. There are also restrictions on the ability of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group to incur debt,
create security, make disposals and acquisitions, enter into joint ventures, give guarantees, make loans, enter into
derivative contracts, make distributions, and change its business. Under the Amended Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Facility Agreement, the restrictive covenants on the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group will be less
restrictive.

A breach of any of the terms of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Facility Agreement or the Amended Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Facility Agreement and the connected documents, failure by the Borrower to make any
payment due under the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Facility Agreement or the Amended Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Facility Agreement and the connected documents, insolvency events in respect of the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group, cross-default to other debt and various other customary events will constitute events
of default under the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Facility Agreement or the Amended Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Facility Agreement. The result of such an event of default is that the Agent may terminate the
commitments under the Facilities, and declare the loans then outstanding due and payable.

**_Convertible Bonds_**

On 24 November 2009, Cable and Wireless plc (the Initial Issuer) issued £230 million convertible bonds due
2014 (the Convertible Bonds).

A-26


-----

The Convertible Bonds are senior debt obligations of Cable and Wireless plc and are convertible into fully paid
ordinary shares of Cable and Wireless plc. Upon Admission, subject to the satisfaction of the substitution
conditions described below and the execution of the Worldwide Substitution Deed and, unless previously
converted, redeemed or purchased and cancelled, the Convertible Bonds become debt obligations of Cable &
Wireless Worldwide and convertible into fully paid ordinary shares of Cable & Wireless Worldwide.

The conditions for the substitution of Cable & Wireless Worldwide as the principal debtor under the Convertible
Bonds upon Admission require that a Substitution Compliance Certificate is delivered to the bond trustee on the
business day in London prior to the date of Admission, certifying that the (i) total net debt for the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group equals no more than £225 million; (ii) total secured bank debt for the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group equals no more than £200 million; (iii) the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has
freely available, uncommitted and unsecured cash and cash equivalents and available credit facilities of not less
than £200 million; and (iv) Cable & Wireless Worldwide is the ultimate holding company of the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group.

The Demerger is conditional upon the delivery by Cable & Wireless Worldwide to the bond trustee of the
Substitution Compliance Certificate. Cable & Wireless Communications will, shortly before Demerger, transfer
the proceeds of the Convertible Bonds to Cable & Wireless Worldwide, thereby allowing Cable & Wireless
Worldwide to deliver the substitution compliance certificate to the bond trustee prior to the Demerger. Pursuant
to the terms of the Separation Agreement, the execution by Cable & Wireless Worldwide and Cable & Wireless
Communications of the Worldwide Substitution Deed which effects the substitution of Cable & Wireless
Worldwide as principal debtor in respect of the Convertible Bonds, will take place no later than immediately
prior to the Admission in consideration for, and subject to, Cable & Wireless Communications having shortly
before Demerger (as described above), transferred such net proceeds of the Convertible Bonds to Cable &
Wireless Worldwide. Therefore, all necessary conditions for the substitution of Cable & Wireless Worldwide as
principal debtor under the Convertible Bonds, subject only to Admission taking place, will have been met, de
_facto, prior to Admission._

In the event that the conditions to transfer the Convertible Bonds to Cable & Wireless Worldwide are not met or
the Demerger does not otherwise complete, Cable and Wireless plc (or, subject to the fulfilment of certain
conditions, Cable & Wireless Communications) shall remain principal debtor under the Convertible Bonds and
the Convertible Bond proceeds will be returned to the principal debtor thereunder. The principal debtor under the
Convertible Bonds from time to time is referred to below as the Convertible Issuer.

From a date falling prior to the Scheme Effective Time, to be specified by Cable and Wireless plc by giving five
days written notice to bondholders, conversion rights under the Convertible Bonds will be suspended until the
date falling 21 dealing days following Admission on which the reset conversion price of the Convertible Bonds
will be established. To the extent that the substitution of Cable & Wireless Worldwide as principal debtor under
the Convertible Bonds has not occurred by the earlier of:

(i) 90 days following the effective date of any such suspension of conversion rights by Cable and Wireless plc
or, if earlier, 31 December 2010; or

(ii) the date on which certain change of control events described in the terms of the Convertible Bonds occur,

the terms of the Convertible Bonds provide that the suspension period shall end on the ninetieth day following
the effective date of the suspension of conversion rights by Cable and Wireless plc (or, if earlier, 30 December
2010) or as the case may be, the date of such change of control event.

The Convertible Bonds carry a coupon from and including 24 November 2009 of 5.75% per annum payable
semi-annually in arrear in equal instalments on 30 June and 30 December in each year, with a long first coupon
on 30 June 2010 of £3,440.57 per £100,000 principal amount of the Convertible Bonds and a short last coupon on
the maturity date of £2,309.43 per £100,000 principal amount of the Convertible Bonds, in each case, in respect
of each Convertible Bond. The conversion price is £1.841 per £100,000 principal amount of the Convertible
Bonds and is subject to adjustment from the issue date of the Convertible Bonds. Unless previously redeemed,
converted or purchased and cancelled, the Convertible Bonds will be redeemed on 24 November 2014 at their
principal amount.

The Convertible Bonds contain a negative pledge which provides that, so long as any of the Convertible Bonds
remain outstanding, the Convertible Issuer and its principal subsidiaries will not create or permit to subsist
security upon their respective assets to secure, guarantee or indemnify any other debt instruments which are
listed or capable of being listed. However, in respect of the Initial Issuer and Cable & Wireless Communications

A-27


-----

only, this negative pledge does not apply to the creation or subsistence of security in respect of listed
indebtedness of no more than US$500 million. The negative pledge also contains certain other customary
exemptions for the benefit of the Convertible Issuer.

Failures to pay all or any part of the principal or interest due in respect of the Convertible Bonds, cross default
and certain other events (linked, inter alia, to insolvency) may constitute events of default under the Convertible
Bonds, subject to customary thresholds and exceptions and, in certain cases, a material prejudice certification
being given by the bond trustee. Such events of default may lead to the acceleration of the repayment of principal
and accrued (but unpaid) interest under the Convertible Bonds.

The Convertible Issuer may, subject to certain conditions, redeem all but not some only of the Convertible Bonds
at their principal amount, together with accrued (but unpaid) interest: (a) at any time on or after 15 December
2012, if the value of the ordinary shares deliverable on conversion of a Convertible Bond exceeds 130% of the
principal amount of a Convertible Bond for a prescribed period; or (b) at any time once 85% or more of the
principal amount of the Convertible Bonds have been purchased and cancelled, converted or redeemed.

Payments in respect of the Convertible Bonds are subject to a customary gross-up provision with relevant carveouts applying from the date that the Convertible Bonds are listed. From such listing date, the Convertible Issuer
will benefit from a right to redeem the Convertible Bonds on the occurrence of certain changes in the tax laws or
regulations of the United Kingdom.

For a period of 60 days following a change of control of the Convertible Issuer (or, if later, notice thereof)
excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the Demerger, the conversion price will be adjusted downwards in
accordance with a formula resulting in straight line amortisation of the conversion premium of the Convertible
Bonds. In addition, on a change of control of the Convertible Issuer, each holder of Convertible Bonds may
exercise their conversion rights or, instead, require the Convertible Issuer to redeem any Convertible Bond held
by such holder at its principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest.

The Convertible Bonds contain customary anti-dilution adjustment provisions dealing with, inter alia, share
consolidations, share splits, capital distributions, extraordinary dividends, rights issues and bonus issues and
customary undertakings to protect the conversion rights of the Convertible Bonds.

The Convertible Bonds and the Convertible Trust Deed are governed by English law.

An application will be made by the Convertible Issuer for the Convertible Bonds to be admitted to listing on the
Official List of the UK Listing Authority and admitted to trading on the Professional Securities Market of the
London Stock Exchange by no later than 30 June 2010.

**Demerger Transaction Agreements**

**_Demerger Agreement_**

Cable & Wireless Worldwide has entered into a Demerger Agreement with Cable & Wireless Communications

The Demerger Agreement also contains customary warranties from Cable & Wireless Worldwide, Cable &

Worldwide Holdings and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s Brand in consideration for the issue to Cable
& Wireless Communications Shareholders of one Cable & Wireless Worldwide Ordinary Share for each such
cancelled Cable & Wireless Communications ‘B’ Share. The only right associated with any Cable & Wireless
Communications ‘B’ Share is the right to receive a Cable & Wireless Worldwide Ordinary Share at the Demerger

redenominated, reorganised and reclassified into an Cable & Wireless Communications Ordinary Share.

A-28


-----

Among other things, the Demerger Agreement requires Cable and Wireless plc to notify Cable & Wireless
Communications by no later than the Demerger Long Stop Date if the Demerger will not be effective by such date
and, upon receipt of such notice, Cable & Wireless Communications will forthwith announce on an RNS that the
Demerger will not proceed. In such case, the Cable & Wireless Communications ‘B’ Shares shall be redenominated,
reorganised and reclassified and a new application for admission to the Official List and to trading on the London

will be made as soon as reasonably practicable after such announcement has been made.

Cable and Wireless plc, CWIGroup Limited and Cable & Wireless Worldwide Holdings which sets forth
agreements that govern certain aspects of the relationship between Cable & Wireless Worldwide and Cable &

Worldwide and Cable & Wireless Communications in relation to the substitution of Cable & Wireless

_Worldwide Group Business—Material Contracts”)._

Under the Separation Agreement, Cable & Wireless Communications and Cable & Wireless Worldwide also

which the Cable & Wireless Communications Group may incur but which relate exclusively to the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group and vice versa and in respect of an agreed proportion of liabilities which do not relate
exclusively to one group or the other. In consideration for a reciprocal undertaking given by Cable & Wireless
Communications, Cable & Wireless Worldwide also agrees to use its reasonable endeavours to procure that each
member of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group is released from all guarantees and indemnities given
in respect of any liability or obligation of any member of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group and, pending
the release of such guarantees and indemnities, indemnifies the Cable & Wireless Communications Group

given by the Cable & Wireless Communications Group) and Cable & Wireless Communications (in respect of
guarantees given by the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group) shall pay a negotiated fee for the maintenance of
such guarantees until such time as they are released.

The Separation Agreement also includes provisions relating to the allocation of tax liabilities and the conduct of
tax affairs of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group relating
to the period prior to the Demerger and sets out the agreements between Cable & Wireless Communications and
Cable & Wireless Worldwide regarding access to financial and other records and information, insurance matters,

arrangements relevant to either of Cable & Wireless Communications Group or Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group after the Demerger Effective Time.

Cable & Wireless Worldwide has entered into a Transitional Services Agreement with Cable & Wireless
Communications pursuant to which each party will provide the other with certain services on an interim basis for

parties agree to work together to identify further services to include in the Transitional Services Agreement

Plan providing security of up to £100 million by way of escrow account or letter of credit in certain
circumstances, based on agreed financial and business triggers.

Before Demerger, Cable and Wireless plc, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group and the trustees of the Cable
& Wireless Superannuation Fund and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Retirement Plan will enter into a
pensions agreement which sets out the full terms of the bulk transfer to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Retirement Plan.

**_Intellectual Property Arrangements_**

-----

The Directors believe that the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s network and continuous development of an
advanced product suite, together with positive customer experience for customers, position it to be able to
capitalise on the trends being experienced in its markets. These include the need to reduce business complexity
through the adoption of next-generation network infrastructure and applications; the demand for voice and data
products, alongside the demand for advanced next-generation technologies, that can enable new business models;
and globalisation, in particular increasing telecommunications traffic between Asia, Europe and the United
States.

On 1 October 2008, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group acquired a controlling interest in THUS Group plc,
the UK focused telecommunications provider. THUS Group plc reported revenue for the year ended 31 March
2008 of £576 million and EBITDA of £57 million and was consolidated into the Cable and Wireless plc accounts
from 1 October 2008. For the period ended 31 March 2008, THUS Group plc employed an average of 1,762
employees.

The quality of Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s revenue continues to improve. Between the six months
ended 30 September 2006 and the six months ended 30 September 2009 the level of incremental sales won from
enterprise customers increased by 70% (as measured by estimated annualised revenue value in the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group’s sales tracking tool). During the same period the Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group achieved a 22% increase in contract length for the contracts signed (for those estimated to deliver greater
that £0.5m annualised gross margin). The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s incremental contract wins in the
six months ended 30 September 2009 in terms of estimated annualised revenue were 67% Data, IP and Hosting,
less than 1% Legacy, with the remainder Traditional Voice. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s current
sales pipeline is split approximately 84% Data, IP & Hosting, 16% Traditional Voice, with no Legacy sales.

In terms of retention, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group continues to provide services to all of its top 25
customers (by gross margin for the six months ended 30 June 2006, being the period shortly after the acquisition
of Energis). In addition, 12 more customers (by gross margin for the six months ended 30 September 2009) now
surpass the annualised margin level that denoted the top 25 customers in that prior period. The gross margin from
the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s top 25 customers (by gross margin for the six months ended
30 September 2008) grew by 11% in the six months ended 30 September 2009 (compared to the six months
ended 30 September 2008).

**The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s principal activities**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group categorises its product offerings in the telecommunications markets
into three types: Data, IP and Hosting, and Traditional Voice and Legacy products.

**_Data, IP and Hosting_**

For the six months ended 30 September 2009, £592 million, or 52% of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s
total revenue, was derived from Data, IP and Hosting services.

Data, IP and Hosting consists of a number of core products:

    - _Wide area networks: The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group provides direct connectivity between_
customer sites on either a point-to-point basis or via a wide area network at speeds from below 2Mbps
to 10Gbps. These are provided in the UK and globally and utilise both IP Virtual Private Networks and
Ethernet technology.

    - _Local area networks: The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s local area network solutions provide_
connectivity within a customer’s physical location.

    - _Local loop unbundling: The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group utilises its 802 unbundled exchanges_
in the United Kingdom to provide data and voice services directly to its own customers and also via
resellers.

    - _Hosting: The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group offers a range of hosting products that utilise the_
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s data centres, which have 205,000 square feet of hosting space
and are based in the UK and the Republic of Ireland and are connected to the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group’s fibre network. Services offered include co-location, server hosting, storage,
website hosting and intelligent network defence (security). For the six months ended 30 September
2009, £92 million, or 8% of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s total revenue, was derived from

hosting services. Of the hosting service total revenue, 26% was for co-location services and 74% was
for managed hosting services. Over the same period, hosting services had £63 million of gross margin.
Hosting revenue and gross margin have grown at 30% and 28% per annum, respectively, since the six
months ended 30 September 2006.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group also provides a number of applications that combine elements of these
core products to provide business services. IP voice is included in this category given its reliance on data
networks. Other examples of applications include:

    - _Managed Video Conferencing: Managed Video Conferencing is delivered over the Cable & Wireless_
Worldwide Group’s global Multi-Service Platform and next-generation network. The solution includes
a next-generation bridging application (Virtual Presence) that connects multiple devices and media into
a single simplified video conferencing service.

    - _Fixed Mobile Convergence: Fixed Mobile Convergence provides customers with an integrated fixed_
and mobile solution giving the flexibility of mobile telephony with the lower cost of a fixed line phone.
FMC provides an in-building mobile network using small Global System for Mobile Communications
network cells (pico-cells) owned by the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group, which in combination
with a roaming agreement in the United Kingdom, allows mobile users to benefit from lower costs and
an integrated service. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group currently offers this service only in the
United Kingdom.

    - _Managed Email: Managed Email combines the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s managed_
services for hosting, security and storage and network infrastructure with commercial software to offer
customers a high-quality messaging infrastructure.

**_Traditional Voice Services_**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s traditional voice revenue in the six months ended 30 September 2009
was £527 million, or 46% of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s total revenue.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group provides a range of voice services to retail and wholesale customers,
including:

    - _Lines and Calls: The provision of either a line connection or calls or both to end users who are either_
the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s own customers or those of a reseller customer. This service
can be provided either on the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s own infrastructure (direct
connection) in which case all aspects of the service, including line and feature rentals and call charges,
are billed by the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group or over a line provided by another carrier in
which case the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group bills for call charges and may or may not bill for
line and feature rentals.

    - _Telebusiness (inbound call management): The provision of call-routing, revenue share and_
management services for non-geographic numbers, such as 0800, 0844 or premium rate lines that are
used by customers for a variety of purposes, including, for example, call centres or TV voting.

    - _Voice Transit and Interconnect: The provision of voice capacity to carry minutes originated by other_
carriers, either to terminate with the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s customers or to terminate
with other carriers taking advantage of Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s extensive voice
interconnect network. This includes calls originating in the UK from fixed and mobile operators as well
as internationally.

**_Legacy Services_**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s revenue from legacy products in the six months ended 30 September
2009 was £22 million, or 2% of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s total revenue. The Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group reports several services as legacy as the platforms and products are nearing end of life. These
include data products (point-to-point links and wide area networks) utilising the Asynchronous Transfer Mode
and Frame Relay protocols and Internet service providers supporting dial-up Internet access.

A-34


-----

**_Service Propositions_**

Each of the above-described products are offered to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s customers
individually or as a combination, together with a proposition that offers three levels of service models:

    - _Standard Service: standard products with standard support and service level agreements, supported_
from a shared customer service centre with common access to corporate monitoring and incident
management teams. This service model represented 52% of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s
total gross margin for the six months ended 30 September 2009.

    - _Managed Service: standard products with bespoke support and service level agreements, supported_
from a secure network operation centre with its own technical expertise to monitor and manage
incidents and interact directly with customers’ technology teams. This service model represented 32%
of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s total gross margin for the six months ended 30 September
2009.

    - _Managed Proposition: bespoke solutions for customers’ communications infrastructure integrated into_
their business processes, supported by a dedicated team with intimate understanding of the customer’s
business. Typically, these solutions will require transfer of ownership of network infrastructure, risk
and/or people. This service model represented 16% of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s total
gross margin for the six months ended 30 September 2009.

Each service proposition is provided with support 24 hours a day, seven days a week from centres based in
Europe and Asia, offering first line response for initial call handling and early diagnosis of faults through to
technical support, shared and dedicated service teams and technology specialists.

**PRINCIPAL FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**

The following section contains a description of the key drivers for the results of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group, both in general and those issues specific to the three and a half years under review.

**Transformation**

After the acquisition of Energis in November 2005, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group implemented a
major turnaround programme and changed its strategy to focus resources on serving fewer, larger customers with
a wide range of IP-based services tailored to their specific business needs. The turnaround strategy involved three
stages: the integration of Energis into the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group business; a recovery stage in
which the business fixed service, reduced complexity and improved the cost base and the quality of earnings; and
a transformation period during which customer propositions and operational performance are intended to exceed
industry standards. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group is currently in the third phase of this strategy,
having successfully completed the integration and recovery phases.

In 2008, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group acquired THUS Group plc, which has generated significant
synergies for the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group.

The results of the turnaround are evident in the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s operating performance
over the last three and a half years—gross margin has improved, operating costs have reduced and customer
satisfaction is at considerably higher levels. This has led to EBITDA of £326 million for the year ended
31 March 2009, including the impact of the acquisition of THUS Group plc on 1 October 2008, compared with
£44 million for the year ended 31 March 2006, and EBITDA margin has increased from 2% to 14% of revenue
over the same period.

**Competition**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group operates in a number of competitive markets around the world and this
competition generally results in downward pressure on prices. In its international markets, the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group competes with both major global operators and local operators in the individual markets in
which it operates. These global operators include AT&T, BT, France Telecom and Verizon. In the United
Kingdom, there are a number of participants in the market. For the enterprise customers, which is the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group’s largest customer grouping, BT is the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s
primary competitor. As at 31 March 2009, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s share of the UK enterprise
telecommunications market was approximately 19%.

-----

**Demand drivers**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group provides a wide range of telecommunications services, primarily to
large corporate customers, multinational companies, governments, carrier customers and telecommunication
resellers. Small and medium sized enterprises are served indirectly via telecommunications resellers and directly
through the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s Thus brand. The key drivers of demand for its products and
services are:

**_Technological development: The telecommunications industry is characterised by rapid technological advances_**
and the frequent introduction of new products and services. This drives demand for new products and services,
and churn from other products and services. For example, the advent of IP-based services has led in recent years
to a shift away from traditional voice services. The most significant recent advance in telecommunications
technology that has affected the results of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group in the period under review is
the development of next-generation networks.

In the period under review, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has developed and launched a full suite of
IP-based products and services, which are enabled by its next-generation network and Multi-Service Platform.
This network provides a common infrastructure and a more robust telecommunication and IT platform, which the
Directors believe can be managed at a lower cost and with greater scalability than legacy platforms. The Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group also was the first operator in the United Kingdom to offer a Fixed Mobile
Convergence solution using GSM guard band spectrum. In addition, the desire of UK companies to look for
additional ways to reduce costs and make business processes and operating models more efficient has led to an
increase in demand for new IP-based applications, which in turn has driven demand for bandwidth (network
capacity) and increased hosting and data storage services. In response to this demand, the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group has developed IP-based applications for customers as part of its core product set, which has
reduced the effect of the economic downturn on the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group. These include
applications such as Managed Video Conferencing, Fixed Mobile Convergence and Managed Email.

**_Globalisation: The globalisation of large corporates has led to increasingly complex telecommunications_**
requirements. As companies grow they need more bandwidth and hosting space and a telecommunications
provider that has global network capability. They are also more likely to outsource the management of their
telecommunications estate as its scale potentially outgrows their internal capability.

**_Economic environment: The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group provides telecommunications solutions to its_**
customers. In times of economic downturn, customers look for ways to reduce their cost base and the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group’s services allow them to do that. As a result, while the current economic downturn
has lengthened sales cycles to corporate customers, reduced the demand for voice minutes and slightly increased
the timing of accounts receivable collections, the impact of an economic downturn on the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group’s business has been moderated.

**Cost drivers**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has three general categories of costs—those which are directly related
to the generation of revenue (cost of sales), those that are fixed (operating costs) and restructuring costs.

**_Cost of sales accounts for those costs that are either variable, typically correlating with changes in revenue, or_**
can be directly attributable to a single customer. A major item in the cost of sales of the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group is the cost that arises when a customer of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group makes a call
or sends data that transfers over or terminates on another operator’s network, either fixed or wireless. The other
network operator charges the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group for their service, and these charges are
referred to as outpayments. Outpayments are based on usage and charges are regulated. Cost of sales also
includes items such as the cost of equipment to be installed in a single customer’s premises (where it is not
capitalised) and the cost of providing a dedicated network, such as wide area networks or local area networks, to
a single customer’s premises. In the four years ended 31 March 2009, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group
has implemented a cost of sales reduction programme, which includes activities such as improving the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group’s network utilisation, reducing its reliance on other network operators, and ongoing
programmes relating to supplier renegotiations and process efficiencies. This programme has led to a reduction in
the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s cost of sales in the period, helping to increase its gross margin as a
percentage of revenue to 42% in the year ended 31 March 2009, compared to 41% in the year ended 31 March
2008.

A-36


-----

**_Operating costs are those costs that are not directly variable in line with changes in revenue, and cannot be_**
directly attributed to a single customer. These include costs such as salaries and wages, licence and operating
arrangement fees, network and cable maintenance and support fees, equipment support fees, rental on properties,
sales and marketing costs, travel, consultancy fees and utilities. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has
focused on reducing its operating cost base in the three years under review and has undertaken activities
including reducing its headcount, renegotiating network maintenance contracts and rationalising its network
assets. This has led to a reduction in operating costs before exceptionals and LTIP in the year ended 31 March
2009 to 27% of revenue, compared to 30% in the year ended 31 March 2008.

**_Restructuring costs are associated with the transformation activities that the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group_**
has undertaken in the period under review to drive improved business performance and reduce operating costs.
They include the integration of the Energis and Thus businesses, the change in strategy to focus on enterprise
customers and a property rationalisation programme to reduce the number of properties and the associated
overheads. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group recorded exceptional charges for restructuring costs of
£65 million in the year ended 31 March 2007, £40 million in the year ended 31 March 2008 and £76 million in
the year ended 31 March 2009 (of which £30 million related to the integration of THUS Group plc).

**Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)**

The LTIP was introduced on 1 April 2006 for the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s most senior managers.
For more details on the LTIP, see the section entitled “Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group—Operating and
_Financial Review” of this document._

Members of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group senior management have waived their right to immediate
vesting of their Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group-related LTIP awards at Demerger so that those awards can
continue until 31 March 2011.

The LTIP is accounted for in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits. The amount accrued as a liability at
each reporting date represents the estimated time pro-rated present value of the obligation. This requires
estimates of the valuation of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group to determine the obligation and requires the
use of a number of assumptions which, by their nature, are subjective and subject to fluctuation. The income
statement charge for each period reflects the movement in the amount accrued in the period. For the periods
under review the income statement charge for the LTIP was £17 million for the year ended 31 March 2007,
£19 million for the year ended 31 March 2008, £17 million for the year ended 31 March 2009 and £2 million for
the six months ended 30 September 2009.

**Acquisitions and disposals**

In the periods under review, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has undertaken a strategic transformation,
resulting in the acquisition of assets that would enable this transformation and the disposal of assets no longer
core to the strategy. The following were the key transactions undertaken in the periods under review or with a
material impact on these periods.

On 11 November 2005, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group purchased Energis for a total consideration of
£739 million. This comprises £690 million paid at the time of the transaction to repay debt and acquire the share
capital of Chelys Limited and a further £49 million in contingent consideration, which was paid in March 2008.

On 8 June 2006, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group announced a revised strategy to leverage its local loop
unbundled network by offering a wholesale product to major broadband service providers and ceasing residential
sales. On 7 September 2006, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group announced its first wholesale customer,
Pipex, and sold its residential broadband customer base and the ‘Bulldog’ brand to Pipex for £9 million of net
cash.

On 2 April 2007, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group signed a 25 year sale and leaseback agreement
covering nine freehold properties in the United Kingdom. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group received
£88 million for the disposal of these properties and recorded an exceptional profit of £53 million. Lease
payments for the first five years were set at £4.5 million per year, subject to review every five years thereafter.

On 30 June 2008, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group, acquired a 29.9% stake in THUS Group plc for £99
million. On and after 1 October 2008, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group purchased the remaining share
capital of THUS Group plc for £244 million and consolidated the results of Thus from that date. Thus reported
revenue for the year to 31 March 2008 of £576 million and EBITDA of £57 million.

-----

**Investment priorities**

In the period under review, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has focused its capital expenditure on
equipment and network infrastructure which is directly related to customer contracts and the expansion of its
local access network. This reflects the change in strategy of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group to focus on
fewer, larger customers and the increase in contract wins as a result of improved product and service offerings.
For the year ended 31 March 2009, 49% of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s capital expenditure was
directly related to customer contracts, compared with 27% for the year ended 31 March 2006. Capital
expenditures represented 12%, 11% and 11% of revenue in the years ended 31 March 2009, 31 March 2008 and
31 March 2007, respectively.

**BASIS OF PREPARATION**

**Overview**

The historical financial information discussed below represents the financial record for the three years ended
31 March 2009 and the two six month periods ended 30 September 2008 and 30 September 2009 of those
businesses that will be held by the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group at the date of Admission.

The financial record is based on historical financial information extracted from the consolidation schedules,
which supported the audited financial statements of the Cable & Wireless Group for the three years ended
31 March 2009 and the unaudited interim statements of the Cable & Wireless Group for the six months ended
30 September 2009 and the six months ended 30 September 2008.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group represents the companies belonging to the Cable & Wireless Group less
those companies that will form the Cable & Wireless Communications Group after the Demerger.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has not in the past formed a separate legal group and therefore it is not
meaningful to show share capital or an analysis of reserves for the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group. The net
assets of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group are represented by the cumulative investment in the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group companies (shown as “invested capital”).

financial information (as described in the Annexure to SIR 2000 (Investment Reporting Standard applicable to
public reporting engagements on historical financial information) issued by the UK Auditing Practices Board).
The application of these conventions results in the following material departures from IFRS as adopted by the
European Union. In all other respects, IFRS as adopted by the European Union have been applied.

**_Non-trading balances with the Cable & Wireless Communications Group_**

At Demerger, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group will not be required to repay non-trading balances with
Cable & Wireless Communications Group. For this reason, these amounts have been included in the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group’s invested capital, rather than being treated as liabilities as required by IFRS.

**_Earnings per share_**

The weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding used to calculate earnings per share is based on the
total number of shares expected to be in issue on listing of Cable & Wireless Worldwide Ordinary Shares. The
shares expected to be in issue on listing of Cable & Wireless Worldwide Ordinary Shares will be equal to the
outstanding shares of Cable and Wireless plc prior to the Demerger. These shares are considered to be the most
appropriate denominator on which to compute earnings per share for the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group.

As a result of the above matters, no statement of compliance with IFRS is included in respect of the historical
financial information.

**_Other principles applied_**

In addition, the following principles have been applied in preparing the historical financial information:

    - There has been no allocation of the Central operations’ costs of the Cable & Wireless Group to the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group. This is because any allocation would be arbitrary in nature and
may not reflect properly the costs relating to functions such as accounting and financial reporting,
treasury and cash management as would have been incurred by that business and may not be
representative of the level of costs required in the future.

    - Trading balances with Cable & Wireless Communications Group are presented within receivables and
payables as though they were with an external party.

    - The main UK defined benefit pension scheme operated by the Cable & Wireless Group provides benefits
to current and past employees of, and therefore represents obligations of, both the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group. For the period since 1 April 2006,
the Cable & Wireless Communications Group and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group have each
borne a proportion of the service costs of this scheme based on the approximate split of active
membership. The scheme’s expected return on assets and interest expense have been apportioned between
Cable & Wireless Communications Group and Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group based on the
Directors’ assumptions about the underlying liabilities, being 20% Cable & Wireless Communications
Group and 80% Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group. The assets, liabilities, actuarial gains and losses and
cash flows of the scheme have been apportioned based on 20% Cable & Wireless Communications Group
and 80% Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group.

Detailed disclosures relating to this scheme are provided in the section entitled “Historical Financial Information
_of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group” of this document._

On Demerger, and as agreed with the scheme trustees, the liabilities of the Cable & Wireless Group’s main UK
defined benefit pension scheme will be allocated approximately evenly between the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group.

Management considers that presenting the historical financial information according to the historical allocation
better represents the underlying historical cost of each of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group and the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group over the periods presented.

If the historical financial information (which has been prepared on the basis of a split of 80% Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group and 20% Cable & Wireless Communications Group) had been prepared on the basis of the
estimated split of assets and liabilities to be applied post-Demerger (i.e. a split of 50% Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group and 50% Cable & Wireless Communications Group), the impact on the relevant financial
statements of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group would have been as follows:

    - Tax charges in the historical financial information have been determined based on the tax charges
recorded by the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group companies in their local statutory accounts as well
as certain adjustments relating to those entities made for Cable & Wireless Group consolidation
purposes. The tax charges recorded in the historical income statement have been affected by the tax
arrangements within the Cable & Wireless Group and are not necessarily representative of the tax
charges that would have been reported had the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group been an
independent group. They are therefore not necessarily representative of the historical tax charges
attributable to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group or tax charges that may arise in the future.

-----

The presentation currency of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group is sterling, as this is the primary currency
in which transactions of Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group entities are conducted.

This historical financial information has been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial
instruments held at fair value. Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale are stated at the lower of their
carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. The preparation of the historical financial information in
accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the
application of policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. These estimates and
associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are considered to be
reasonable under the circumstances. They form the basis of judgements about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual outcomes may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on a continuing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates
are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.

The accounting policies used in the historical financial information for the periods presented have been applied
consistently by the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group entities.

**Principal Income Statement Line Items**

    - **_Revenue: The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group revenue, which excludes discounts, value added tax_**
and similar sales taxes, represents the amount receivable in respect of services provided to customers.
It includes sales to joint ventures and associated companies, but does not include sales by joint ventures
and associated companies or sales between the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group companies.
Revenue is recognised only when payment is probable.

    - **_Cost of sales: The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s cost of sales are set forth in note 4 to the_**
historical financial statements in the section entitled “Historical Financial Information of the Cable &
_Wireless Worldwide Group”, and are costs that are either variable in line with changes in revenue or_
can be directly attributable to a single customer, for example outpayments and customer premise
equipment (where not capitalised).

    - **_Gross Margin: Revenue less cost of sales._**

    - **_Operating costs: Costs that are not variable in line with changes in revenue or cannot be directly_**
attributable to a single customer, for example, salaries and wages, network maintenance and support,
property rental, utilities and travel.

    - **_EBITDA: The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s EBITDA is set forth in note 4 to the historical_**
financial statements in the section entitled “Historical Financial Information of the Cable & Wireless
_Worldwide Group”, and represents earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, amortisation, LTIP_
charge, net other operating income/expense and, unless otherwise specified, exceptional items.

    - **_EBITDA Margin: EBITDA divided by revenue._**

    - **_LTIP: Long Term Incentive Plan. In line with IAS 19 Employee Benefits, the expected payout is_**
estimated at each reporting period and the amount expected to that date accrued in the statement of
financial position. The charge to the income statement for the relevant period is the movement in the
statement of financial position accrual.

    - **_Net other operating income or expense: Represents the net of income and expenses which are not_**
derived from underlying trading of the business but which are related to operations, for example, gains
on the sale of property, plant and equipment.

    - **_Net finance income or expense: Consists of the net amount of items such as interest on cash and_**
deposits and, other investment income, and interest on loans, finance charges on leases and the
unwinding of discounts on provisions and other financial instruments.

    - **_Gains/losses on sale of non-current assets: Arise on the sale of businesses that do not meet the_**
definition of discontinued operations or investments.

**Impact of Demerger**

In November 2009, the Cable and Wireless plc Board announced the proposed separation of Cable and Wireless
plc’s two businesses, the Cable & Wireless Communications Group and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group,
into independently listed companies, by way of the Demerger.

-----

At Demerger, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group is expected to have sufficient cash and credit lines to
support its business and to meet at least three years of projected financing and refinancing needs post-Demerger,
with negligible net debt and good liquidity during this period. At Demerger it will have no material loans
maturing within three years and will have sufficient liquidity to cover its seasonal working capital requirements
and invest in its business to support customer growth in this period. Upon Admission, the Convertible Bonds
become obligations of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group and, shortly before Demerger, the Convertible
Bonds’ net proceeds will be transferred to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group. In addition, the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group has agreed an amendment to its existing £200 million secured credit facility which,
as at Demerger will be increased to a three year £300 million secured credit facility. As a result of the receipt of
the Convertible Bond proceeds and this facility, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group will have cash and
available credit at Demerger of approximately £500 million. For more details on the debt facility, refer to the
section entitled “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements”.

The Central operations of the Cable & Wireless Group will be combined with the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group. For the year ended 31 March 2010 the corporate costs of the Central operations of the
Cable & Wireless Group are expected to be £22 million. It will be necessary for Cable & Wireless
Communications and Cable & Wireless Worldwide to incur the equivalent corporate costs in order to operate as
independent, listed companies. For the year ended 31 March 2011, these costs are expected to be £12 million for
Cable & Wireless Communications and £10 million for Cable & Wireless Worldwide.

80% of the assets and liabilities of the main UK defined benefit pension scheme operated by the Cable &
Wireless Group have historically been allocated to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group. On the Demerger,
approximately half of the pension assets and liabilities of the main UK defined benefit pension scheme operated
by the Cable & Wireless Group will be transferred to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group, with the other half
remaining with the Cable & Wireless Communications Group. If such a transfer had been effected at
30 September 2009, the portion of the £305 million IAS 19 Employee Benefits pension deficit on this scheme
allocated to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group would have been approximately half of the Cable &
Wireless Superannuation Fund deficit. This would amount to approximately £153 million, representing a
£92 million increase to the historical net assets presented for the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group. The result
of this change on the income statement of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group for the six months ended
30 September 2009 would have been to increase profit by £1 million.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group and the Cable & Wireless Communications Group have agreed to
share the use of the Cable & Wireless Trademarks on the terms of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Licence and
the Cable & Wireless Communications Licence, each as described in the section entitled “Cable & Wireless
_Worldwide Group Business—Material Contracts”. The use of the Cable & Wireless Trademarks by the Cable &_
Wireless Communications Group and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group is restricted under the trademark
licences as described in the section entitled “Cable & Wireless Worldwide Business—Intellectual Property
_Arrangements”._

**Commentary on the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group operating performance**

**_Comparison of the six months ended 30 September 2009 with the six months ended 30 September 2008_**

_Revenue_

Total revenue for the six months ended 30 September 2009 was £1,141 million, an increase of £138 million, or
14%, compared to the same period in the previous year. The increase in revenue is due to the inclusion of THUS
Group plc revenue, as well as organic growth in Data, IP and Hosting revenue, partially offset by reduced project
work, reduction in legacy revenue and lower voice revenue due to fewer minutes and changes in regulation.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s Data, IP and Hosting revenue grew by £165 million, or 39%, to
£592 million in the six months ended 30 September 2009, compared with £427 million in the equivalent period in
the previous year, driven by the inclusion of THUS Group plc revenue and growth from increased demand for its
strategic product set, partially offset by the reduction in project work. Data, IP and Hosting revenue as a
proportion of total revenue was 52% in the six months ended 30 September 2009, up from 43% in the six months
ended 30 September 2008.

Traditional voice revenue decreased by £3 million, or less than 1%, from £530 million in the period ended
30 September 2008 to £527 million in the period ended 30 September 2009, reflecting £110 million from the
acquisition of THUS Group plc offset by a £50 million reduction in revenues as a result of the recession,
£43 million as a result of removing low margin traffic from the network and £20 million as a result of regulated
pricing of mobile termination rates and non-geographic number ranges.

Revenue from the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s legacy products reduced by £24 million, or 52%, from
£46 million in the six months ended 30 September 2008 to £22 million in the six months ended 30 September
2009 and represented only 2% of revenue in the six months ended 30 September 2009. This decline was
principally due to the winding down of two dial-up ISP contracts as customers migrated to broadband contracts.

_Gross margin_

In the six months ended 30 September 2009, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s gross margin increased
by £119 million, or 29%, to £533 million, reflecting the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s fifth consecutive
half-year of absolute gross margin growth, together with the acquisition of THUS Group plc. Gross margin as a
percentage of revenue increased from 41% in the six months ended 30 September 2008 to 47% in the six months
ended 30 September 2009. A portion of this improvement was due to the effect of much reduced volumes of low
margin and traditional voice revenue. The remaining movement reflected the continuing change in the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group’s product mix towards its strategic product set of Data, IP and Hosting and activities
to reduce cost of sales. These activities included improving the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s network
utilisation, reducing its reliance on other network operators, and ongoing programmes relating to supplier
renegotiations and process efficiencies.

_Operating costs_

In the six months ended 30 September 2009, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s pre-exceptional operating
costs increased by £56 million, or 21% compared with the six months ended 30 September 2008 to £328 million.
This was due to an extra £76 million as a result of the acquisition of THUS Group plc and an increase in
provisions of £12 million, partially offset by approximately £16 million of synergies and £16 million of cost
reductions in the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s existing business. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group continued with its programme of renegotiating its network maintenance contracts, rationalising its
network assets and working with suppliers to use their services more cost-effectively, which all contributed to the
net reduction in operating costs.

_EBITDA (excluding exceptional items)_

As a result of the above factors, EBITDA before exceptional items and LTIP charge and net other operating
income increased by £63 million to £205 million for the six months ended 30 September 2009. As a percentage
of revenue, EBITDA improved from 14% for the six months ended 30 September 2008 to 18% for the six
months ended 30 September 2009, reflecting the growth in higher margin Data, IP and Hosting and the success
of the THUS Group plc integration programme.

_Depreciation and amortisation_

Depreciation and amortisation was £131 million for the six months ended 30 September 2009, compared with
£88 million for the six months ended 30 September 2008. This increase reflected the level of capital expenditure
in previous years and the impact of the acquisition of THUS Group plc.

_Net finance expense_

The £7 million increase in net finance expense excluding exceptional items in the six months ended
30 September 2009 reflects increased borrowings undertaken by the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group in the
six months ended 30 September 2009.

_Exceptional items_

In the six months ended 30 September 2009, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group recognised net exceptional
operating charges of £28 million, compared with net exceptional operating charges of £33 million in the six
months ended 30 September 2008. Exceptional charges in the six months ended 30 September 2009 included
£23 million from the integration of THUS Group plc, and £5 million from redundancy and property
rationalisation costs of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s existing business.

**_Comparison of the year ended 31 March 2009 with the year ended 31 March 2008_**

_Revenue_

Total revenue for the year ended 31 March 2009 was £2,268 million, an increase of £327 million, or 17%,
compared to the previous year. This increase reflected an additional £237 million from the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group’s acquisition of THUS Group plc on 1 October 2008, together with continuing demand for its
Data, IP and Hosting products from large corporate customers of approximately £90 million.

Data, IP and Hosting revenue increased by £262 million, or 34%, to £1,036 million in the year ended 31 March
2009. Data, IP and Hosting as a proportion of revenue increased to 46% for the year ended 31 March 2009, up
from 40% in the year ended 31 March 2008.

Traditional voice revenue increased by £78 million, or 7%, from £1,071 million in the year ended 31 March 2008
to £1,149 million in the year ended 31 March 2009, primarily reflecting £103 million from the acquisition of
THUS Group plc, offset by a £25 million reduction in revenues as a result of price erosion and customers
migrating to IP voice services.

Revenue from the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s legacy products reduced from £96 million in the year
ended 31 March 2008 to £83 million in the year ended 31 March 2009, and represented only 4% of revenue in
the year ended 31 March 2009. This decline was expected as customers chose to migrate to more advanced
services, such as IP Virtual Private Networks.

-----

_Gross margin_

In the year ended 31 March 2009, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s gross margin increased by
£142 million, or 18%, to £945 million. The acquisition of THUS Group plc contributed £100 million of this gross
margin improvement. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased from 41% in the year ended 31 March
2008 to 42%, which reflected the change in the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s product mix towards its
strategic product set of Data, IP and Hosting, and activities to reduce cost of sales. These activities included
improving the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s network utilisation, reducing its reliance on other network
operators, and ongoing programmes relating to supplier renegotiations and process efficiencies.

_Operating costs_

In the year ended 31 March 2009, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s pre-exceptional operating costs
increased by £35 million, or 6%, compared with the year ended 31 March 2008, to £619 million. This was due to
£71 million as a result of the acquisition of THUS Group plc, offset by a £36 million of cost reductions in the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s existing business. During the period, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group continued to renegotiate its network maintenance contracts, rationalise its network assets and work with
suppliers to use their services more cost-effectively, which all contributed to the reductions in operating costs.
The cost savings are net of an £11 million increase in energy spend as a result of rising electricity costs in the
year ended 31 March 2009.

_EBITDA (excluding exceptional items)_

As a result of the above factors, EBITDA before exceptional items increased by £107 million, or 49%, to
£326 million for the year ended 31 March 2009. As a percentage of revenue, EBITDA improved from 11% for
the year ended 31 March 2008 to 14% for the year ended 31 March 2009.

_Depreciation and amortisation_

Depreciation and amortisation was £212 million for the year ended 31 March 2009, compared with £157 million
for the year ended 31 March 2008. This increase reflected the impact of the acquisition of THUS Group plc, the
level of capital expenditure in recent years and the effect of previous impairments. Excluding Thus, depreciation
and amortisation was £193 million.

_Net finance expense_

The £3 million increase in net finance expense in the year ended 31 March 2009 reflects increased borrowings
undertaken by the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group in the second half of the year.

_Exceptional items_

In the year ended 31 March 2009, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group recognised net exceptional operating
charges of £76 million compared with a net exceptional operating gain of £13 million in the previous year. The
year ended 31 March 2009 included a £46 million charge for restructuring costs due to redundancies and property
rationalisation related to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s turnaround programme, and £30 million of
costs relating to the acquisition of THUS Group plc.

**_Comparison of the year ended 31 March 2008 with the year ended 31 March 2007_**

_Revenue_

Total revenue for the year ended 31 March 2008 was £1,941 million, a decrease of £198 million, or 9%,
compared to the year ended 31 March 2007. This decrease reflected the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s
strategy to focus on serving larger customers with higher margin IP services, whilst actively removing lower
margin customers.

Data, IP and Hosting revenue increased by £56 million, or 8%, to £774 million in the year ended 31 March 2008
despite the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s disposal of its web design business (WTG) on 1 February 2007
and its structured cabling business Cable & Wireless (Allnet) Limited on 2 April 2007, which together
contributed £66 million of revenue during the year ended 31 March 2007. Excluding the impact of WTG and
Cable & Wireless (Allnet) Limited, the growth rate of these products was 19%.

A-46


-----

Traditional voice revenue declined by 11%, from £1,201 million in the year ended 31 March 2007 to
£1,071 million in the year ended 31 March 2008, as the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group moved away from
unprofitable routes and low margin traffic and customers migrated to other products, such as email and IP voice.

Revenue from the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s legacy products reduced from £191 million in the year
ended 31 March 2007 to £96 million in the year ended 31 March 2008, and represented only 5% of revenue in
the year ended 31 March 2008. This decline was expected as customers chose to migrate to more advanced
services, such as IP Virtual Private Networks.

In September 2006, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group ceased to provide consumer broadband products as
it moved to a wholesale strategy. Accordingly, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group did not generate any
consumer broadband revenue in the year ended 31 March 2008, compared with £29 million in the year ended
31 March 2007.

_Gross margin_

In the year ended 31 March 2008, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s gross margin increased by
£15 million, or 2%, to £803 million. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased from 37% in the year
ended 31 March 2007 to 41%, which reflected the change in the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s product
mix towards its strategic product set of Data, IP and Hosting, and activities to reduce cost of sales. These
activities included improving the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s network utilisation, reducing its reliance
on other network operators, and ongoing programmes relating to supplier renegotiations and process efficiencies.

_Operating costs_

In the year ended 31 March 2008, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s pre-exceptional operating costs
reduced by £120 million, or 17%, compared with the year ended 31 March 2007, to £584 million. The Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group delivered cost savings through a number of projects, including reducing its total year
end headcount by 9% and off-shoring some non-customer facing roles, such as finance. The Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group also renegotiated its network maintenance contracts, rationalised its network assets and
worked with suppliers to use their services more cost-effectively, all of which contributed to the reduction in
operating costs.

Further reductions resulted from the move to a wholesale strategy in the Cable & Wireless Access business in the
year ended 31 March 2007, the subsequent integration of Cable & Wireless Access into the main corporate
business, and the disposal of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s structured cabling and web design
businesses. Operating costs for the year ended 31 March 2008 included a £14 million net credit relating to the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s main UK defined benefit pension scheme operated by the Cable &
Wireless Group, compared with a £4 million net credit for the year ended 31 March 2007.

_EBITDA (excluding exceptional items)_

As a result of the above factors, EBITDA before exceptional items and LTIP more than doubled from
£84 million to £219 million for the year ended 31 March 2008, an increase of £135 million from the year ended
31 March 2007. As a percentage of revenue, EBITDA improved from 4% for the year ended 31 March 2007 to
11% for the year ended 31 March 2008.

_Depreciation and amortisation_

Depreciation and amortisation was £157 million for the year ended 31 March 2008 compared with £128 million
for the year ended 31 March 2007. This increase reflected the level of capital expenditure in that year relative to
previous years and the impact of an asset impairment in the year ended 31 March 2006.

_Net other operating income_

The £2 million of net other operating income in the year ended 31 March 2008 compares with £8 million for the
year ended 31 March 2007 and primarily reflects profits on the disposal of property, plant and equipment.

_Net finance expense_

The £2 million increase in net finance expense in the year ended 31 March 2008 relates primarily to an increase
in the charges relating to the unwinding of discounts on provisions. This compares with £6 million of net finance
expense for the year ended 31 March 2007.

A-47


-----

_Exceptional items_

In the year ended 31 March 2008, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group recognised net exceptional operating
gains of £13 million compared with net exceptional operating charges of £89 million in the previous year. The
year ended 31 March 2008 included a £40 million charge for restructuring costs due to redundancies and property
rationalisation related to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s turnaround programme and a £53 million
profit on the disposal of nine properties as part of the sale and leaseback transaction completed in April 2007,
which was recorded in net other operating income.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and bank
financing. As at 30 September 2009, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group had net cash and cash equivalents
of £150 million and undrawn credit lines of £95 million, out of total available credit lines of £207 million. The
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s financing arrangements are described in more detail in the section entitled
“Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group Business—Material Contracts”.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s principal use of funds are costs of sales (primarily costs associated
with private circuits and interconnect), operating costs (primarily employee costs and the cost of network
maintenance contracts) and restructuring costs, as described above in the section entitled “Cable & Wireless
_Worldwide Group Operating and Financial Review—Principal factors affecting the results of operations” of this_
document. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group also continues to invest in fixed assets relating to specific
customer projects that yield a contracted return, together with strategic investments that enhance its network
reach and capabilities.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s treasury operations manage its net interest-bearing debt and cash
balances on a day-to-day basis. To facilitate daily liquidity management, cash pools covering relevant jurisdictions
have been established. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group holds cash in a variety of currencies, principally
sterling, US dollars and euros. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash, short term deposits and other liquid
investments with an appropriate short term maturity. For a discussion of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s
policies as related to management of market risk, see the section entitled “Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group
_Operating and Financial Review—Qualitative and quantitative disclosures on market risk”._

**_Comparison of the six months ended 30 September 2009 with the six months ended 30 September 2008_**

At 30 September 2009, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group had £150 million of cash and cash equivalents.

Net cash from operating activities increased by £4 million in the six months ended 30 September 2009 to
£109 million, compared with £105 million in the six months ended 30 September 2008. This increase was
primarily the result of an increase in EBITDA of £63 million over the six months ended 30 September 2008,
offset by a working capital outflow of £23 million primarily reflecting higher trade receivables and inventories,
compared with a £12 million inflow in the six months ended 30 September 2008 and £34 million of LTIP
payments in the six months ended 30 September 2009.

Net cash used in investing activities was an outflow of £124 million in the six months ended 30 September 2009,
compared with a £202 million outflow in the six months ended 30 September 2008. The decrease was largely a
result of the six months ended 30 September 2008 where £99 million was paid for a 30% stake in THUS Group
plc, which was subsequently acquired on 1 October 2008.

As a result of the above, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s net cash outflow before financing improved
by £82 million to a £15 million outflow in the six months ended 30 September 2009.

Net cash flows from financing activities in the six months ended 30 September 2009 decreased from a
£104 million inflow in the six months ended 30 September 2008 to a £22 million inflow. This was due to the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group reducing the value of transactions financed by its parent company in the six
months ended 30 September 2009 compared with the six months ended 30 September 2008.

**_Comparison of the year ended 31 March 2009 with the year ended 31 March 2008_**

At 31 March 2009, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group had £144 million of cash and cash equivalents
representing a £125 million increase from 31 March 2008.

Net cash from operating activities increased £141 million in the year ended 31 March 2009 to £242 million. This
increase was primarily the result of £107 million EBITDA growth compared with the prior year and a
£32 million improvement in the movement in working capital, primarily the higher trade payables.

Net cash used in investing activities was an outflow of £568 million in the year ended 31 March 2009 compared
with a £174 million outflow in the year ended 31 March 2008. The increase was largely the result of the
£330 million paid for the acquisition of THUS Group plc net of cash acquired. Payments for capital expenditure
increased by £23 million to £245 million.

As a result of the above, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s net cash before financing decreased by
£253 million to a £326 million outflow in the year ended 31 March 2009.

Net cash from financing activities in the year ended 31 March 2009 increased from a £75 million inflow in the
year ended 31 March 2008 to a £449 million inflow. This was due to Cable and Wireless plc financing the
acquisition of THUS Group plc, together with paying down THUS Group plc’s third party debt and related
financing costs of £113 million. In addition, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group drew down £99 million
from a revolving third party facility.

Cash exceptionals in the year ended 31 March 2009 were a £71 million outflow compared with a £56 million
outflow in the year ended 31 March 2008.

**_Comparison of the year ended 31 March 2008 with the year ended 31 March 2007_**

At 31 March 2008, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group had £19 million of cash and cash equivalents
representing a £4 million increase from 31 March 2007.

Net cash from operating activities increased £178 million in the year ended 31 March 2008 to an inflow of £101
million. This increase was primarily the result of £135 million EBITDA growth compared with the previous year
and a £61 million improvement in the movement in working capital.

Net cash used in investing activities was an outflow of £174 million in the year ended 31 March 2008 compared
with a £195 million outflow in the year ended 31 March 2007. With capital expenditure broadly flat at
£222 million, the decrease of £21 million was largely the result of £88 million of proceeds from the property sale
and leaseback transaction, offset by the payment of £49 million of contingent consideration relating to the
acquisition of Energis in the year ended 31 March 2008.

A-49


-----

As a result of the above, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s net cash flow before financing improved by
£199 million to a £73 million outflow in the year ended 31 March 2008.

Net cash from financing activities in the year ended 31 March 2008 decreased from a £273 million inflow in the
year ended 31 March 2007 to a £75 million inflow. This was due to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group
generating additional operational cash and therefore requiring less funding from the Cable & Wireless Group.

Cash exceptionals in the year ended 31 March 2008 were a £56 million outflow compared with a £75 million
outflow in the year ended 31 March 2007.

**_Cash and debt_**

At 30 September 2009, the balance of cash and cash equivalents was £150 million. The debt held by the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group at such time related to a £110 million draw down on a £200 million three year
facility, US dollar and other currency loans payable of £9 million and obligations under finance leases of
£25 million, £11 million of which is current and £14 million of which is non-current. All of the obligations under
the finance leases are secured by the assets to which they relate.

**_Comparison of the six months ended 30 September 2009 with the six months ended 30 September 2008_**

In the six months ended 30 September 2009, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group invested £137 million in
capital expenditure, compared with £108 million in the six months ended 30 September 2008. The increase was
attributable to servicing an increased customer base as a result of acquiring THUS Group plc, together with
expenditure on THUS integration projects of £11 million.

**_Comparison of the year ended 31 March 2009 with the year ended 31 March 2008_**

In the year ended 31 March 2009, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group invested £265 million in capital
expenditure, an increase of £44 million over the year ended 31 March 2008. This was a result of the purchase of
additional international capacity and £9 million of cost required to achieve the Thus integration, which cost
included investment in additional capacity required for the migration of THUS Group plc’s corporate customers
onto the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s network.

**_Comparison of the year ended 31 March 2008 with the year ended 31 March 2007_**

In the year ended 31 March 2008, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group invested £221 million in capital
expenditure compared with £235 million in the year ended 31 March 2007.

_Capital expenditure categorisation:_
The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group groups its capital expenditure into four categories:

    - Cost out - expenditure relating to projects that drive synergies and cost out programmes

    - Maintenance - expenditure required to keep the network and supporting systems in good order

    - Capability - investing in new products and infrastructure

    - Contracted return - expenditure directly linked to the provision of customer contracts
The percentage of capital expenditure across the above four categories is set out in the table below:

**Note:**

(1) Excludes THUS Group plc.

Over half of the capital expenditure is now linked to customer contracts, which help drive business growth,
particularly in the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s strategic project set of Data, IP and Hosting.

**Taxation**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group is subject to corporate income tax at various rates in the countries
where the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group operates and also is subject to withholding taxes on revenues for
services provided in certain countries (mainly in Asia). The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s principal
country for corporate income tax purposes is the United Kingdom, where its future corporate income tax liability
is expected to be reduced by available capital allowances in respect of historic capital expenditure. The Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group’s effective tax rates in any given financial year reflect a variety of factors that may
not be present in the succeeding financial year or years. As at 30 September 2009, the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group had a timing difference in respect of UK capital allowances of £3.8 billion. The recognition
and subsequent utilisation of these timing differences may result in non-cash deferred tax credits and charges in
addition to any underlying current tax charge. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group also has tax losses of £13
billion in various countries and UK capital losses of £5.2 billion, however the opportunities to realise value from
these are considered limited. For further details please refer to the section entitled “Risk Factors” of this
document.

**Qualitative and quantitative disclosures on market risk**

**_Treasury Policy_**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk,
including currency risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group’s overall risk management programme seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group’s financial performance.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s treasury operations are managed on the basis of policies and
authorities approved by the Cable and Wireless plc Board. These policies are expected to be adopted by the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group in substantially the same form post-Demerger. Day to day management of
treasury activities is delegated to the Chief Financial Officer and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group
Treasurer (together, Treasury), within specified financial limits for each type of transaction and counterparty.

To the extent that subsidiaries undertake treasury transactions, these are governed by Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group policies and delegated authorities. Material subsidiary positions are monitored by Treasury
Where appropriate, transactions are reported to the Board. The key responsibilities of Treasury include funding,
investment of surplus cash and the management of interest rate and foreign currency risk. The majority of the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s cash resources and borrowings are managed centrally.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group may use derivatives, such as forward foreign exchange contracts, in the
management of its foreign currency and interest rate exposures. The use of these instruments would be in
accordance with strategies agreed from time to time by Treasury subject to policies approved by the Board.
Derivatives are not used for trading or speculative purposes and all derivative transactions and positions are
monitored and reported to the Board at each Board meeting and are subject to policies adopted by the Board.

-----

**_Exchange rate risk_**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group trades in several countries, however, the majority of the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group’s revenue is earned in sterling. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s main
foreign currency exposure relates to movements in exchange rates for foreign currency payments. Exchange risk
is measured on the basis of current or future net foreign currency payments. Details of the net currency position
of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group are set out in note 25 to “Historical Financial Information of the
_Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group” of this document._

Where appropriate the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group manages its exposure to movements in exchange
rates on a net basis and uses forward foreign exchange contracts and other derivative instruments to reduce the
exposures created where currencies do not naturally offset in the short-term. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group will undertake hedges, where appropriate, to minimise the exposure to individual transactions that create
significant foreign exchange exposures for the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group. The reported results of the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.

**_Interest rate risk_**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group is exposed to movements in interest rates on its surplus cash balances
and floating rate debt. The Treasury function may seek to reduce volatility by fixing a proportion of this interest
rate exposure whilst taking account of prevailing market conditions as appropriate. There were no interest rate
derivatives in place as at 30 September 2009.

A one percentage point lowering of interest rates will have a £2 million impact on the income received from the
surplus cash balances of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group and a £1 million impact on debt with floating
interest rates. The impact on equity is limited to the impact on the income statement.

**_Credit risk_**

Cash deposits and similar financial instruments give rise to credit risk, which represents the loss that would be
recognised if a counterparty failed to perform as contracted. Management seeks to reduce this risk by ensuring
the counterparties to all but a small proportion of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s financial instruments
are entities rated A1 short-term and/or AA- (or better) long-term by Standard & Poor’s (or equivalent by
Moody’s and/or Fitch). The credit rating of these counterparties is monitored on a continuing basis.

The types of instrument used for investment of funds are prescribed in Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group
treasury policies approved by the Board. These policies contain limits on exposure to any one counterparty.

**_Liquidity risk_**

At 30 September 2009, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group had cash and cash equivalents of £150 million
(31 March 2009—£144 million, 31 March 2008—£19 million, 31 March 2007—£15 million). These amounts are
highly liquid and are a component of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s overall liquidity and capital
resources.

Liquidity forecasts are produced on a regular basis to ensure the utilisation of current facilities is optimised, that
covenant compliance targets and medium-term liquidity are maintained and also for the purpose of identifying
long-term strategic funding requirements. The Board of Directors also continually assesses the balance of capital
and debt funding of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group.

The majority of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s cash is held centrally and is predominantly invested in
short-term bank deposits.

**Off balance sheet arrangements**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s off balance sheet arrangements consist of capital commitments and
guarantees and contingent liabilities.

At 30 September 2009, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group had capital commitments relating to the
purchase of property, plant and equipment of £125 million. No provision was made for these commitments.

In addition, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group had a number of operating commitments arising in the
ordinary course of its business. The most significant of these related to network operating and maintenance costs.
In the event of default of another party, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group may be liable to additional
contributions under the terms of the agreements.

Trading guarantees principally comprised performance bonds issued in the normal course of business,
guaranteeing that the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group would meet its obligations to complete projects in
accordance with the contractual terms and conditions. The nature of contracts included projects, service level
agreements, installation of equipment, surveys, purchase of equipment and transportation of materials. The
guarantees contained a clause that they would be terminated on final acceptance of work to be done under the
contract.

Historically, the Cable & Wireless Group provided guarantees to third parties in respect of contracts between
these third parties and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group. These guarantees amounted to £502 million and
are included in the table above. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has agreed a fee schedule with Cable &
Wireless Communications Group for the benefit of these guarantees. £211 million of guarantees contain
conditional rights of substitution relating to the Demerger. Further, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has
indemnified the Cable & Wireless Communications Group for these guarantees post-Demerger. To date, the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has not been required to make any payments in respect of its obligations
under its trading guarantees.

Other guarantees included guarantees for financial obligations principally in respect of borrowings, leases and
letters of credit.

In the ordinary course of its business, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group is engaged in litigation
proceedings, regulatory claims, investigations and reviews. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group considers
that adequate allowance has been made in respect of these matters and does not expect the ultimate resolution of
the actions to which it is a party to have a materially adverse impact on the financial position of the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group. For further details please refer to the section entitled “Cable & Wireless Worldwide
_Group Business—Material Litigation”._

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group does not have any significant special purpose vehicles used for
financing that are not consolidated or disclosed.

As at 31 December 2009, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group had cash and cash equivalents of £91 million,
debt of £116 million (of which £81 million was drawn down under its bank facilities) and undrawn facilities of
£126 million.

**CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS**

A full list of critical assumptions is included in “Historical Financial Information of the Cable & Wireless
_Worldwide Group” of this document, a selection of which are presented below._

**_Revenue recognition: Revenue, which excludes discounts, value added tax or other sales taxes, represents the_**
amount receivable in respect of services provided to customers and is accounted for on the accruals basis to
match revenue with the provision of service. Revenue is recognised monthly as services are provided. Revenue in
respect of services invoiced in advance is deferred and recognised on provision of the service. Revenue in respect
of unbilled services is accrued.

Judgement is required in assessing the application of these principles and the specific guidance in respect of the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s revenues, including in relation to the presentation of revenue as principal
or as agent in respect of income received from transmission of content provided by third parties.

**_LTIP: The LTIP creates a reward pool over a five year period from 1 April 2006 (or until a vesting event, if_**
earlier) depending on the extent to which the business has grown in value from its base valuation at the start of
the period (this period was changed from four to five years in July 2009). Base valuations are adjusted over the
performance period (i) to reflect additional capital notionally treated as borrowed by the business, (ii) to reflect
capital notionally treated as returned by the business, and (iii) as increased by the notional weighted average cost
of capital of the business (which will be at least 8% per annum compounded). If the business’ value is lower than
its adjusted base valuation at the end of the performance period, there will be no reward pool. To the extent that
the business’ value exceeds its adjusted base valuation at the end of the performance period, 10% of the excess
growth in value goes into the reward pool.

A-54


-----

Part of the reward pool was payable to participants at the end of year three (31 March 2009), with a portion
payable (less payments made at end of year three) to participants at the end of year four (31 March 2010) and the
balance will be payable at the end of year five (31 March 2011). Measurement of the size of the reward pool is
carried out every six months to correspond with the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s accounting periods.
However, other than in the case of awards held by participants who ceased employment as “good leavers,” no
awards vested until the end of year three. In the event of a potential payment to an individual in excess of
£20 million, the deferral period would be extended until 31 March 2012 or for a period of up to one year
following a vesting event, if earlier.

The LTIP charge calculated in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits requires an estimation of the valuation
of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group to determine the obligation for the LTIP. The estimates require the
use of a number of assumptions which, by their nature, are subjective.

**_Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets: The Directors assess the impairment of_**
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (excluding goodwill) whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, or otherwise as required by accounting
standards. Factors that are considered important and which could trigger an impairment review include the
following:

    - Obsolescence or physical damage;

    - Significant changes in technology and regulatory environments;

    - Significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;

    - Significant changes in the use of its assets or the strategy for its overall business;

    - Significant negative industry or economic trends; and

    - Significant decline in its stock price for a sustained period and its market capitalisation relative to net
book value.

In addition, the Directors test goodwill, which is not amortised, at least annually for impairment.

The identification of impairment indicators, the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of the
recoverable amount for assets or cash generating units requires significant judgement concerning the
identification and validation of impairment indicators, the timing and amount of expected cash flows and
applicable discount rates.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group determines any impairment by comparing the carrying values of each
of its cash generating units to their recoverable amounts, which is the higher of net realisable value and the value
in use. Net realisable value represents the market value in an active market less the cost to sell. Value in use is
determined by discounting future cash flows arising from the asset or cash generating unit to which it refers.
Future cash flows are determined with reference to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s own projections
using discount rates which represent the estimated weighted average cost of capital.

**CABLE & WIRELESS TRADEMARKS**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group and the Cable & Wireless Communications Group have agreed to share
the use of the Cable & Wireless Trademarks and the “Cable & Wireless Globe” logo on the terms of the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Licence and the Cable & Wireless Communications Licence, each as described in the
section entitled “Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group Business—Material Contracts” of this document. Subject
to certain rights of the Cable & Wireless Communications Group, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group is
licensed to use the Cable & Wireless name in the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Territory and the acronym
“CWW” globally, and subject to certain rights of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group, the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group is licensed to use the Cable & Wireless name in the Cable & Wireless Communications
Territory. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Territory encompasses substantially all the territories where the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group currently operates. Each group has certain rights to use the Cable &
Wireless Trademarks outside its respective territory as described in the section entitled “Business—Material
_Contracts” of this document._

**REGULATORY OUTLOOK**

Telecommunications is a regulated industry; the nature and scope of regulatory obligations applicable to the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group and to its competitors can have a significant impact on its business. The

A-55


-----

Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group, therefore, monitors and, where appropriate, participates in the regulatory
process, with a view to protecting its interests and ensuring it can both continue to develop its product and
service capability, and serve its customers efficiently and effectively. For a description of the risk of regulatory
changes, see page A-13 in “Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group Risk Factors” of this document.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group holds licences or authorisations in 23 separate jurisdictions and
generally works with partners to deliver services to other countries. In the United Kingdom, the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group holds various licences to use radio spectrum for fixed link and mobile services and,
in addition, it is authorised to offer a full suite of telecommunications services. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group also holds licences or authorisations to operate in all major European markets, the United States, Canada
and major Asian markets, such as India, Singapore and Hong Kong. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group
also maintains many industry quality standards including ISO27001 (information security management standard),
BS25999 (business continuity standard) and for the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland, ISO9001 (quality
assurance standard).

**PENSION SCHEME**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group operates defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes for
its current and former UK and overseas employees.

In the United Kingdom, before Demerger, employees of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group have generally
been able to participate in the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund. Following Demerger, Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Services Limited will be the principal employer of the newly-established Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Retirement Plan, which will provide defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements for
current and former employees of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group, on the same basis as applied to them
under the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Retirement Plan will be
closed to new defined benefit members.

The Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund has been closed to new defined benefit members since 1998. The
latest full actuarial valuation of the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund was carried out as at 31 March 2007
by independent actuaries. On an ongoing basis, there was a deficit of £15 million. The ongoing funding position
is expected to have significantly deteriorated since the 31 March 2007 valuation. On an IAS 19 basis, at
30 September 2009, the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund had a deficit of £305 million. Following the bulk
transfer of pensions assets and liabilities, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Retirement Plan is expected to have a
deficit. If the bulk transfer had been effected at 30 September 2009, it is expected that the pension deficit
allocated to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group would have been approximately half of the Cable &
Wireless Superannuation Fund deficit.

**_Bulk transfer to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Retirement Plan_**

The key commercial terms and legal principles of the bulk transfer are included in a binding heads of terms
agreement between Cable and Wireless plc, Cable & Wireless Worldwide Services Limited and the trustee of the
Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund. Before Demerger, the same parties and the trustee of the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Retirement Plan will enter into the Pensions Agreement which sets out the full terms of the
bulk transfer.

Following Demerger, there will be a bulk transfer of approximately half of the assets and liabilities of the Cable
& Wireless Superannuation Fund to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Retirement Plan, in respect of current and
former employees of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group. The membership will be split on the basis of the
last known employer of each member. This split will result in approximately 6,300 defined benefit members
remaining with the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund and approximately 8,700 defined benefit members
moving to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Retirement Plan.

**_Cable & Wireless Worldwide Retirement Plan_**

Following Demerger, the assets of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Retirement Plan will be held by a trustee
board separately from the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group. The trustee will have the power to trigger the
winding-up of the scheme in certain circumstances. If the trustee uses this power, the participating employers
would become liable by statute to make contributions to the pension scheme to remove any deficit calculated on
the more conservative, buy-out basis, enabling the trustee of the pension scheme to purchase individual annuity
policies for all members of the scheme.

A-56


-----

During 2008, the trustee of the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund agreed an insurance buy-in of its UK
pensioner liabilities, approximately half of the total liabilities, with Prudential Insurance. The buy-in involved the
purchase of a bulk annuity policy by the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund under which Prudential
Insurance assumed responsibility for the benefits payable to the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund’s UK
pensioners with effect from 1 August 2008. The pensioner liabilities and the matching annuity policy remain
within the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund. Following Demerger, the buy-in policy will be split between
the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund and the newly-established Cable & Wireless Worldwide Retirement
Plan in accordance with the allocation of corresponding members.

**_Funding of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Retirement Plan_**

Following discussions with the trustee of the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund, a payment of £5 million
will be made to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Retirement Plan on Demerger. It has also been agreed that the
interim funding plan agreed between Cable and Wireless plc and the trustee of the Cable & Wireless
Superannuation Fund in July 2008 will be split and two new interim funding plans will be established, one for the
Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund and one for the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Retirement Plan. Pursuant
to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide agreement, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group will make payments of
£11 million in October 2010 and £25 million in April 2011.

Following Demerger, the trustees of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Retirement Plan will undertake a first
actuarial valuation of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Retirement Plan. The funding and investment strategy
will be agreed by the trustee of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Retirement Plan and Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Services Limited as part of that valuation.

A new contingent funding agreement will also be entered into with the trustee of the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Retirement Plan, providing security of £100 million by way of escrow account or letter of credit in
certain circumstances based on agreed financial and business triggers. The existing contingent funding agreement
will cease to apply on Demerger.

In addition, under the heads of terms, Cable & Wireless Worldwide and certain other Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group companies have agreed to guarantee the pensions obligations of the principal employer of the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Retirement Plan.

**_Clearance from the Pensions Regulator_**

A number of companies and directors within the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group have sought clearance
from the Pensions Regulator in respect of the Demerger and bulk transfer of pension assets and liabilities from
the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund, such that the Pensions Regulator would consider that it was not
reasonable in the circumstances of the Demerger to impose any liability on those applicants under a contribution
notice or financial support direction under the Pensions Act 2004 in respect of the Cable & Wireless
Superannuation Fund or the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Retirement Plan.

Clearance is expected to be granted on the basis that the bulk transfer from the Cable & Wireless Superannuation
Fund and the other terms of the heads of terms appropriately address the effect of the Demerger on the Cable &
Wireless Superannuation Fund and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Retirement Plan.

**_Other Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group pension arrangements_**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group operates the THUS Group Pension Scheme, a defined benefit pension
scheme. The THUS Group Pension Scheme is in the process of completing an actuarial valuation which is
expected to show a small deficit on a scheme specific basis as at 31 December 2008, which the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group expects to pay to the scheme by one-off payment.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group also operates defined benefit arrangements in Hong Kong and Ireland,
as well as unfunded liabilities in the UK relating to pension provision for former directors and other senior
employees and other small defined benefit and defined contribution pension arrangements in the United
Kingdom.

**FINANCIAL GUIDANCE FOR 2009/10**

**CURRENT, TRADING, TRENDS AND PROSPECTS**

Below is an extract from the text of the Cable and Wireless plc trading update issued on 2 February 2010 in
respect of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group:

“Cable and Wireless plc confirms the 2009/10 EBITDA guidance given on 5 November 2009: Worldwide
_continues to expect that its 2009/10 EBITDA will be approximately £430 million._

_The costs and expenses related to demerger are expected to be approximately £22 million, to be shared_
_approximately £12 million by Cable & Wireless Communications and approximately £10 million by Cable &_
_Wireless Worldwide._

A-58


-----

_Worldwide continues to make excellent progress with strong new contract wins in the third quarter. Worldwide_
_expects to achieve its EBITDA and operating cash flow guidance for 2009/10, with EBITDA of approximately_
_£430 million, capital expenditure of approximately £280 million and exceptional costs (cash and P&L) of_
_approximately £70 million and £55 million respectively before any costs arising from the demerger._

_In the third quarter we saw strong sales of our strategic product set—Data, IP and Hosting—up more than 40%_
_on the same period last year. These are long term contracts and can take nine months or more to convert into_
_revenue. The recessionary effects that we saw earlier in the year are showing some signs of abating; for example_
_voice minutes have stabilised and we have seen the anticipated improvement in the levels of project work. In the_
_second half, revenue will reflect the previously noted regulatory price changes which will have a minimal effect_
_on our margins. Gross margin continues to grow in line with our expectations._

_The integration of Thus continues to make good progress and we are on track to deliver the expected synergies of_
_£104 million by 2011/12.”_

**PROFIT FORECAST**

**Profit forecast for the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group for the year ended 31 March 2010**

On 5 November 2009, Cable and Wireless plc published its Interim Results for the six months ended
30 September 2009. The Interim Results contained the following statements in respect of the Cable & Wireless
Group:

“With EBITDA growth of 44% in the first half, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group business is performing
_well as we continue to increase margin from our strategic product set and reduce costs in the face of a global_
_recession which has led to lower traditional voice revenue and less discretionary project work. We continue to_
_expect that the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group 2009/10 EBITDA will be approximately £430 million._

_We have reclassified £20 million of cost to achieve the Thus synergies from exceptionals to capital expenditure,_
_reflecting a change in how the costs are expected to arise. We have reduced our expected Cable & Wireless_
_Worldwide Group P&L exceptional costs for 2009/10 by £15 million to £55 million, reflecting the_
_reclassification of Thus costs to achieve, partially offset by bringing forward £5 million of exceptional_
_restructuring costs from 2010/11. Overall, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s cash guidance remains_
_unchanged.”_

Accordingly, on the basis of preparation, and based on the principal assumptions set out below, the Directors
forecast that for the year ending 31 March 2010, the post-exceptional EBITDA (as defined below) of the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group will be approximately £375 million.

The statements above regarding post-exceptional EBITDA in 2009/10 represent a profit forecast under the
Prospectus Rules. The Directors have considered the above statement and continue to believe that it is valid
based on the assumptions below.

**Basis of preparation**

The Directors confirm that the profit forecast described above in (the Profit Forecast), has been properly
compiled on the basis of the assumptions stated below and using accounting policies which are in accordance
with IFRS, as adopted in the EU, and is consistent with those adopted by the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group
in the preparation of the accounts included in “Historical Financial Information” of the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group of this document.

The Profit Forecast is based upon the audited consolidated results for the six months ended 30 September 2009
(set out in Part “Historical Financial Information” of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group of this document),
the results shown by unaudited management accounts for the three months ended 31 December 2009 and the
Directors’ forecast of the results for the three month period ending 31 March 2010.

Post-exceptional EBITDA represents earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, LTIP credit/
charge and net other operating income/expense.

The Profit Forecast does not include any costs related to the Demerger.

A-59


-----

The Profit Forecast is stated on the basis of the EBITDA after exceptional items rather than profit before tax due
to the extent of existing guidance which has been provided to the market by Cable and Wireless plc on both
EBITDA and exceptional items. Guidance on the EBITDA performance of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group has been provided for a number of years as it represents the measure on which management consistently
assess the performance of the business and it is also the measure on which both shareholders and analysts attach
greatest significance. During the course of 2009, Cable and Wireless plc also provided guidance on the level of
exceptional items in the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group. Accordingly, the Directors consider EBITDA after
exceptional items to be the most appropriate basis to present the Profit Forecast.

**Principal assumptions**

The Profit Forecast has been prepared on the basis of the following principal assumptions:

_Assumptions within the control or influence of the Directors_

There will be no material acquisitions and disposals during the financial year ending 31 March 2010 other than
those already reported.

_Assumptions outside the control or influence of the Directors_

The main assumptions outside the control of the Directors are:

    - there will be no material changes to the general trading and economic conditions in each of the markets
or jurisdictions in which the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group operates from that which is currently
prevailing and/or anticipated by the Directors, which would cause a material change in levels of
demand;

    - there will be no material litigation or customer dispute that may arise in the period other than those that
are currently prevailing and/or anticipated by the Directors;

    - there will be no change to legislation or regulatory environments in the jurisdictions in which the
business operates that would materially impact on the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s
operations, or its accounting policies;

    - there will be no major disruption to the business of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group, its
suppliers or customers due to natural disaster, terrorism, extreme weather conditions, industrial
disruption, civil disturbance or government action;

    - there will be no material changes in interest, inflation or exchange rates;

    - there will be no material change in the present management or control of the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group or its existing operational strategy; and

    - the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group will continue to enjoy the goodwill and confidence of present
and potential customers, and of its strategic partners.

comparable with actual amounts that would have occurred had the Demerger been in effect during the periods

**Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group notes to the historical financial information**

**1.** **General information**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group is an international telecommunications group providing corporate and
carrier solutions to large users of telecommunications services across the United Kingdom, the Middle East and
Asia.

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies**

2.1 Basis of preparation

The historical financial information represents the financial record for the three years ended 31 March 2009 and
the two six month periods ended 30 September 2008 and 30 September 2009 of those businesses that will be held
by the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group at the date of admission of the shares of Cable & Wireless
Worldwide to the London Stock Exchange. Following the Demerger, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group
will comprise the entities forming the Cable & Wireless Group other than those entities comprising the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group. The principal entities, including joint ventures, included within the historical
financial information are set out in note 39.

The financial record is based on historical financial information extracted from the consolidation schedules
which supported the audited financial statements of the Cable & Wireless Group for the three years ended
31 March 2009 and the unaudited interim statements of the Cable & Wireless Group for the six months ended
30 September 2009 and the six months ended 30 September 2008.

Throughout this document, ‘FY’ refers to the twelve month periods ended 31 March and ‘HY’ refers to the six
month periods ended 30 September.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has not in the past formed a separate legal group and therefore it is not
meaningful to show share capital or an analysis of historical reserves for the Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group. The net assets of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group are represented by the cumulative investment
in the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group companies (shown as “invested capital”).

_Application of IFRS_

The historical financial information has been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European
Union, except as described below. The historical financial information has also been prepared in accordance with
applicable listing rules and requirements of the Prospectus Directive (including the regulation regarding issuers
with complex financial histories).

IFRS does not provide for the preparation of extracted financial information. Accordingly, the historical financial
information in this document has been prepared using certain commonly used accounting conventions (as
described in the Annexure to SIR 2000 (Investment Reporting Standard applicable to public reporting
engagements on historical financial information) issued by the UK Auditing Practices Board). The application of
these conventions results in the following material departures from IFRS as adopted by the European Union. In
all other respects, IFRS as adopted by the European Union have been applied.

_Non-trading balances with the Cable & Wireless Communications Group_

At Demerger, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group will not be required to repay non-trading balances with
the Cable & Wireless Communications Group. For this reason, these amounts have been included in Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group’s invested capital, rather than being treated as liabilities as required by IFRS.

_Earnings per share_

The weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding used to calculate earnings per share is based on the
number of shares expected on listing of Cable & Wireless Worldwide Ordinary Shares. The shares expected on
listing of Cable & Wireless Worldwide Ordinary Shares will be equal to the outstanding shares of Cable and
Wireless plc prior to the Demerger. Therefore, these shares are considered to be the most appropriate
denominator on which to compute earnings per share for the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group.

AF-8


-----

As a result of the above matters, no statement of compliance with IFRS can be included in respect of the
historical financial information.

_Other principles applied_

In addition, the following principles have been applied in preparing the historical financial information:

    - There has been no allocation of the corporate head office costs of the Cable & Wireless Group to the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group. This is because any allocation would be arbitrary in nature and
may not reflect properly the costs relating to functions such as financial reporting, treasury and Board
costs as would have been incurred by that business. Therefore, the costs of the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group may not be representative of the level of costs required in the future.

    - Trading balances with the Cable & Wireless Communications Group are presented within receivables
and payables as though they were with an external party.

    - The main UK defined benefit scheme operated by the Cable & Wireless Group provides benefits to
current and past employees of, and therefore represents obligations of, both the Cable & Wireless
Communications Group and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group. For the period since 1 April
2006, the two Groups have each borne a proportion of the service costs of this scheme based on the
approximate split of active membership. The scheme’s expected return on assets and interest expense
have been apportioned between the two Groups based on the Directors’ assumptions about the
underlying liabilities, being 20% Cable & Wireless Communications Group and 80% Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group. The assets, liabilities, actuarial gains and losses and cash flows relating to the
scheme have been apportioned based on 20% Cable & Wireless Communications Group and 80%
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group.

Detailed disclosures relating to this scheme are provided in note 29.

On Demerger, as agreed with the scheme trustees, the liabilities of the main UK defined benefit
pension scheme operated by the Cable & Wireless Group will be allocated approximately equally
between the Cable & Wireless Communications Group and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group.

Management believes presenting the historical financial information according to the historical
allocation better represents the underlying pension cost of the two Groups over the periods presented.

If the historical financial information (which has been prepared on the basis of a split of 20% Cable &
Wireless Communications Group and 80% Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group) had been prepared on
the basis of the approximate actual split of liabilities to be applied post-Demerger (i.e. a split of 50%
Cable & Wireless Communications Group and 50% Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group), the impact
on the relevant financial statements of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group would have been as
follows:


**Year ended**
**31 March**


**Six month periods**
**ended 30 September**


**2007** **2008** **2009** **2008** **2009**

Impact on the statement of cash flows (increase in cash) . . . . . . 3 8 6 5 2

- Tax charges in the historical financial information have been determined based on the tax charges
recorded by the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group companies in their local statutory accounts as well
as actual adjustments relating to those entities made for Cable & Wireless Group consolidation
purposes. The tax charges recorded in the historical income statement have been affected by the tax
arrangements within the Cable & Wireless Group and are not necessarily representative of the tax
charges that would have been reported had the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group been an
independent group. They are not necessarily representative of the tax charges that may arise in the
future.

The presentation currency of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group is sterling as this is the primary currency in
which transactions of Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group entities are conducted.

The historical financial information has been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial
instruments held at fair value. Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale are stated at the lower of their
carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. The preparation of the historical financial information in
accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the
application of policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. These estimates and
associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are considered to be
reasonable under the circumstances. They form the basis of judgements about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual outcomes may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on a continuing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates
are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected. Critical
judgements and areas where the use of estimates is significant are discussed in note 3.

The accounting policies used in the historical financial information have been applied consistently by Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group entities.

2.2 Application of recently issued International Financial Reporting Standards

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has considered the implications of the upcoming amendments to IFRS,
issued up to 30 September 2009, in the historical financial information.

**New and amended Standards and Interpretations endorsed by the European Union and not adopted by the**
**Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group**

**Title** **Effective date** **Description and impact on the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group**


**Amendments to IAS 39**
_Financial Instruments:_
_Recognition and_
_Measurement: Eligible_
_Hedged Items_


Annual periods
beginning on or
after 1 July 2009.


**Revised IFRS 3** Annual periods
_Business Combinations_ beginning on or
after 1 July 2009.


**Revised IAS 27**
_Consolidated and Separate_
_Financial Statements_


Annual periods
beginning on or
after 1 July 2009.


The amendment clarifies how existing hedge accounting
principles should be applied to the designation of a one-sided
risk in a hedged item and to inflation in a hedged item. This
amendment will not have a material impact on the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group.

The main changes in the revised IFRS 3 include the separate
accounting of acquisition related costs, changes to business
combinations achieved in stages and changes to the accounting
for business combinations where less than 100% of the equity
is acquired. These changes will be effective for businesses
purchased by the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group after
31 March 2010. As such, no assessment can be determined of
their impact.

The revisions to IAS 27 specify that changes in a parent’s
ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in the loss
of control must be accounted for as equity transactions. This
amendment is consistent with current Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group policy.

2.3 Basis of consolidation


Annual periods
beginning on or
after 1 January
2010.


This amendment contains further disclosure requirements to
enhance the information available to investors about fair value
measurement and liquidity risk associated with an entity’s
financial instruments. This is a disclosure standard only and
will not have a material impact on the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group.

The Improvements to IFRS contains miscellaneous necessary
but non-urgent amendments to IFRSs. These improvements
will not have a material impact on the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group.

These amendments clarify the scope of IFRS 2 and its
interaction with other standards. They also address how an
entity should account for some share-based payments in its
own financial statements if its parent or another entity in the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group will pay for goods or
services that it has received. These amendments will not have
a material impact on the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group.


The consolidated historical financial information comprises a consolidation of the accounts of the parent and
subsidiaries of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group of companies and include the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group’s share of the results and net assets of its joint ventures. The accounts of the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group’s main trading subsidiaries and joint ventures have been prepared to align with the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group’s reporting date.

(a) _Subsidiaries_

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by and forming part of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group. Control
exists when the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has the power to govern the financial and operating
policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, the existence and effect
of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable are considered. Subsidiaries are consolidated from
the date on which the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group effectively takes control until the date that
control ceases. Accounting policies of subsidiaries are aligned with the policies adopted by the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group to ensure consistency.

AF-11


-----

The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed
and equity instruments issued at the date of exchange plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition. The
excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s share of the
identifiable net assets and contingent liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is
less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in
the income statement.

Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction
provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.

(b) _Joint ventures_

Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are initially
recognised at cost. Joint ventures are entities over which the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group exercises
joint control. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s investment in joint ventures includes goodwill (net
of any accumulated impairment loss) identified on acquisition. Accounting policies of joint ventures have
been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s share of its joint ventures’ post-acquisition profits or losses is
recognised in the income statement. Its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in
invested capital. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the
investment.

When the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s share of its joint venture’s losses exceeds its investment in
the joint venture (including any other unsecured long-term receivables), the Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group does not recognise further losses unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the
investee.

Unrealised gains on transactions between the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group and its joint ventures are
eliminated to the extent of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s interest.

2.4 Segmental reporting

Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group is an international telecommunications service provider. It provides
corporate and carrier solutions to large users of telecommunications services across the United Kingdom and
other regions of the world.

IFRS 8 Segmental Reporting requires disclosures in respect of the operating segments of the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group according to the ‘management approach’. This approach reflects the type and extent of
information presented to the chief operating decision-maker of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group (the
**Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group Board).**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group Board considers the results of the business as a whole when assessing
the performance of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group and making decisions about the allocation of
resources. Accordingly, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group discloses a single operating segment. The
results of this operating segment are reported in note 4 in a manner consistent with the internal reporting
provided to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group Board.

2.5 Foreign currency translation

(a) _Functional currency_

Items included in the historical financial information of each of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s
entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates
(the functional currency).

(b) _Foreign currency translation_

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency of each entity using the exchange
rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the
settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.

AF-12


-----

(c) _Foreign operations_

The results and financial position of all the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group entities that have a
functional currency different from the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s presentation currency of
sterling are translated as follows:

(i) assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the reporting date;

(ii) income and expenses are translated at rates closely approximating the rate at the date of the
transactions; and

(iii) resulting exchange differences are recognised in invested capital.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and
liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.

On disposal of a foreign entity, accumulated exchange differences are recognised in the income statement in
the same period in which the gain or loss on disposal is recognised.

Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities are taken to
invested capital. Where investments are matched in whole or in part by foreign currency loans, the exchange
differences arising on the retranslation of such loans are also recorded as movements in the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group’s invested capital.

There are no Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group entities operating in a hyperinflationary economy.

2.6 Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
The cost of property, plant and equipment includes labour and overhead costs arising directly from the
construction or acquisition of an item of property, plant and equipment.

The estimated costs of dismantling and removing an asset and restoring the site on which it is located are
included in the cost of property, plant and equipment. The corresponding obligation is recognised as a provision
in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.

Subsequent costs are included in an asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate,
only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other subsequent costs (primarily repairs
and maintenance) are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.

Interest costs relating to borrowings made to finance separately identifiable major capital projects (those that take
six months or more to complete) are capitalised as part of the cost of assets when it is probable that they will
result in future economic benefits to the entity and the costs can be measured reliably. Any interest costs included
are only those that are incurred up to the time that those projects are ready for service.

Depreciation is not recognised on freehold land or assets under construction. On other property, plant and
equipment, depreciation is recognised on the difference between the cost of an item and its estimated residual
value, on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

**Lives**

Cables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . up to 20 years
Network equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 to 25 years
Ducting . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 40 years
Freehold buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 40 years
Leasehold buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . up to 40 years or term of lease if less

Asset residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date. An asset’s
carrying amount is written down to its recoverable amount if the carrying amount is greater than its recoverable
amount through sale or use.

Gains and losses on the sale of property, plant and equipment are determined by reference to the proceeds and net
book values. These gains and losses are recognised in the income statement.

AF-13


-----

Engineering spares held for use by the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group over a period exceeding one year are
included in assets under construction. They are stated at cost and include an appropriate allocation of labour and
overheads. The cost is determined on a weighted average basis. Allowance is made for deterioration and
obsolescence.

2.7 Intangible assets

(a) _Goodwill_

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group’s share of the identifiable net assets and contingent liabilities of the acquired subsidiary
or joint venture. It is not amortised. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill on acquisitions of joint ventures is included in the carrying value of those investments. Goodwill
is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is
allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.

(b) _Other intangible assets_

Costs that are directly associated with the purchase and implementation of identifiable and unique software
products by the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group are recognised as intangible assets. Expenditures that
enhance and extend the benefits of computer software programs beyond their original specifications and
lives are recognised as a capital improvement and added to the original cost of the software.

Expenditure is only capitalised if costs can be measured reliably, the product is technically and
commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group
has sufficient resources to complete development and to use the asset.

Intangible assets relating to licences and customer contracts have been obtained as part of the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group’s business combinations. They are recorded initially at their fair values at the
date of acquisition.

Other intangible assets are amortised over their respective lives which are usually based on contractual
terms.

Other intangible assets are stated at cost less amortisation on a straight-line basis over the following periods:

**Lives**

Licences . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25 years or less if the licence term is shorter
Software . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 to 5 years
Customer contracts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4 to 15 years
Other . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 to 5 years

2.8 Financial assets and liabilities

**Financial assets**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories: financial
assets at fair value through the income statement, receivables, held-to-maturity investments and
available-for-sale financial assets. The classification depends on the purpose for which the assets are held. The
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group currently does not classify any assets as held-to-maturity investments. The
basis of determining fair values is set out in note 2.9.

Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition in accordance with IAS 39
_Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and re-evaluates this designation at every reporting date_
for financial assets other than those held at fair value through the income statement.

_Financial assets at fair value through the income statement_

This category has two sub-categories: financial assets held for trading and those designated at fair value through
the income statement at inception. A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the
purpose of selling in the short-term or if so designated by management. Derivatives are also categorised as held
for trading. Assets classified as financial assets at fair value through the income statement are presented as
current assets if they are either held for trading or are expected to be realised within one year of the reporting
date.

AF-14


-----

_Available-for-sale financial assets_

Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated in this category at
inception or not classified in any of the other categories. They are included in non-current assets unless
management intends to dispose of the asset within 12 months of the reporting date. Purchases and sales of assets
are recognised on the trade-date (the date on which the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group commits to purchase
or sell the asset).

_Receivables_

Receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an
active market. They arise when the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group provides money, goods or services
directly to a third party with no intention of trading the receivable. Receivables are included in current assets,
except for those with maturities greater than one year after the reporting date (where they are classified as
non-current assets). Receivables are included in trade and other receivables in the statement of financial position.

Receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. Amortised cost is
determined using the effective interest method less an allowance for impairment if necessary. An allowance for
impairment of receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. The amount
of the allowance is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future
cash flows (discounted at the effective interest rate). The allowance is initially recognised in the income
statement.

_Recognition and measurement_

Financial assets at fair value through the income statement are recognised and subsequently carried at fair value.
Available-for-sale financial assets are recognised and subsequently carried at fair value plus any directly
attributable transaction costs. Receivables and held-to-maturity investments are carried at amortised cost using
the effective interest method. Financial assets not carried at fair value through the income statement are initially
recognised at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs.

Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the assets have expired or have been
transferred and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of
ownership. Gains and losses (both realised and unrealised) arising from changes in the value of financial assets
held at fair value through the income statement are included in the income statement in the period in which they
arise.

Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of non-monetary securities classified as
available-for-sale are recognised in invested capital. When securities classified as available-for-sale are sold or
impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments are included in the income statement.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that
a financial asset or a Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group of financial assets is impaired. In the case of equity
securities classified as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below
its cost is considered in determining whether it is impaired. If any such evidence exists for available-for-sale
financial assets the cumulative loss is removed from invested capital and recognised in the income statement.
This loss is measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any
impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the income statement. Impairment losses
recognised on these instruments are not reversed through the income statement if the fair value of the security
increases in a later period.

**Derivative financial instruments**

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are
subsequently re-measured at their fair value at each reporting date. The method of recognising the resulting gain
or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item
being hedged. Gains and losses on derivative instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments are
recognised immediately in the income statement.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group does not hedge net investments in foreign operations.

AF-15


-----

**Financial liabilities**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group classifies its financial liabilities into the following categories: loans and
puttable instruments. The classification depends on the terms of the liability, as described below.

Management determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition in accordance with IAS
39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and re-evaluates this designation at every reporting
date.

_Loans_

Loans are recognised initially at fair value net of directly attributable transaction costs incurred. Loans are
subsequently measured at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the
redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the loans using the effective interest
method.

Loans are classified as current liabilities unless the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has an unconditional
right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date (where they are classified as
non-current liabilities).

_Puttable instruments_

Puttable instruments on minority interests issued as part of a business combination are accounted for by the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group as a financial liability. The liability is based on the present value of the
redemption amount as if the puttable instrument had been exercised at the reporting date. Movements in the value
of the liability together with dividends paid to minority interests are recognised as adjustments to goodwill with
the unwind of the discount on the fair value calculation being recognised in the income statement.

2.9 Fair value estimation for financial instruments

The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such as publicly traded derivatives or trading and
available-for-sale securities) is based on quoted market prices at the reporting date. The quoted market price used
for traded financial assets held by the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group is the current bid price. The
appropriate quoted market price for traded financial liabilities is the current offer price. The fair value of forward
foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange market rates at the reporting date.

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation
techniques. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group uses a variety of methods which include the use of recent
arm’s length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow
analysis and option pricing models which reflect the specific instrument.

The nominal value of receivables (less estimated valuation allowances) and payables are assumed to approximate
their fair values. The fair value of financial liabilities measured at amortised cost for disclosure purposes is
estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to
the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group for similar financial instruments. Discounted cash flows are used to
determine the fair value for the majority of remaining financial instruments.

2.10 Impairment of assets (excluding financial instruments)

Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
All other non-current assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are
grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash generating units).

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group determines any impairment by comparing the carrying values of each
of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s assets (or cash generating units to which it belongs) to their
recoverable amounts which is the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Fair value
represents market value in an active market. Value in use is determined by discounting future cash flows arising
from the asset. Future cash flows are determined with reference to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s
own projections using pre-tax discount rates which represent the estimated weighted average cost of capital for
the business. The approach, assumptions and results of the impairment test are set out in note 14.

AF-16


-----

Impairment reviews involve management making assumptions and estimates, which are highly judgmental and
susceptible to change.

2.11 Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is the price paid less any rebates, trade
discounts or subsidies. It also includes delivery charges and import duties, but does not include value added taxes
or advertising and administration costs. Cost is based on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) principle. For inventories
held for resale, net realisable value is determined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business
less costs to sell. For materials and consumables, provision is made for obsolete and slow moving inventories as
required.

2.12 Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and at bank, short-term deposits, money market funds and
government securities. They are highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash
and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the
statement of financial position at cost. Bank overdrafts are included within loans in current liabilities on the
statement of financial position.

2.13 Invested capital

Invested capital represents the net amounts contributed to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group by Cable &
Wireless Communications Group. At Demerger, it is expected that there will be no contractual obligation to
repay these amounts and hence they have been treated as invested capital in the historical financial information.
These amounts are recorded at cost.

2.14 Leases

Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has substantially all the
risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the inception of
the lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset or the present value of minimum lease payments. Each
lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant periodic rate of
interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The corresponding rental obligations, net of
finance charges, are included in loans and obligations under finance leases. These payments are split between
capital and interest elements using the annuity method. The property, plant and equipment acquired under
finance leases is depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term.

Leases comprising a lease of land and a lease of buildings within a single contract are split into the two
component parts. The component part for buildings is then tested to determine whether the lease is a finance or
operating lease and treated accordingly.

Leases of land and all other leases are classified as operating leases and are not recognised in the statement of
financial position. Payments made under operating leases, net of lease incentives or premiums received, are
charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.

2.15 Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale

When the value of non-current assets is expected to be recovered principally through sale rather than through
continuing use, they are classified as non-current assets held for sale. With the exception of deferred tax assets,
assets arising from employee benefits and financial instruments, these assets are classified as current and are
stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.

Disposal groups are groups of assets and liabilities to be disposed of together as a group in a single transaction.
They are recognised as held for sale at the reporting date and are separately disclosed as current assets and
liabilities in the statement of financial position.

Measurement differences arising between the carrying amount and fair value less cost of disposal are treated as
impairment charges and separately disclosed.

AF-17

2.16 Employee benefits

_Defined contribution pensions_

A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group pays fixed
contributions to a third party. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group pays contributions to publicly or privately
administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions
are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an
asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.

_Defined benefit obligations_

A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive
on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. These
schemes are generally funded through payments to insurance companies or trustee-administered funds,
determined by periodic actuarial calculations.

The asset (or liability) recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of each defined benefit pension
plan represents the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligations and any asset
ceiling adjustments at the reporting date. Defined benefit obligations for each scheme are calculated semiannually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of these obligations
is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate
bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid. The bonds used will have terms to
maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group recognises actuarial gains and losses, arising from experience
adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions, in the period in which they occur in the statement of
comprehensive income. Past service costs are recognised immediately in income, unless the changes to the
pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time (the vesting
period). In these cases, the past service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.

Current service costs and any past service costs, together with the unwinding of the discount on plan liabilities
less the expected return on plan assets, are included within operating costs.

The IAS 19 surplus or deficit of defined benefit funds is adjusted to reflect the future economic benefits available
in the form of a cash refund or a reduction in future contributions, allowing for minimum funding contributions
in accordance with IFRIC 14. Any adjustment to the surplus is recorded directly in invested capital.

_Share-based compensation_

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group operates various equity-settled, share-based compensation plans. The
fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense
over the vesting period. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to
the fair value of the options granted, which excludes the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for
example, service, profitability and sales growth targets). Non-market vesting conditions are included in estimates
about the number of options that are expected to vest. At each reporting date, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the
revision of original non-market estimates, if any, in the income statement, and a corresponding adjustment to
invested capital over the remaining vesting period.

The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to invested capital when the
options are exercised.

_Termination benefits_

Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated before the normal retirement date or whenever
an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to the action leading to the employee’s
termination. Termination benefits falling due more than a year after the reporting date are discounted to present
value.

AF-18


-----

_Bonus plans_

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group recognises a liability where contractually obliged or where there is a
past practice that has created a constructive obligation.

_Cable & Wireless Long Term Incentive Plan_

Cable and Wireless plc operates the LTIP. The plan rewards executive directors of Cable and Wireless plc
responsible for, and certain senior employees in, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group. The plan is accounted
for as an ‘other long-term employee benefit’ in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits. The amount
recognised as a liability represents the estimated present value of the obligation at the reporting date.

The LTIP creates a reward pool over a five year period from 1 April 2006 (or until a vesting event, if earlier)
depending on the extent to which the business has grown in value from its base valuation at the start of the period
(this period was changed from four to five years in July 2009).

Base valuations are adjusted over the performance period (i) to reflect additional capital notionally treated as
borrowed by the business, (ii) to reflect capital notionally treated as returned by the business, and (iii) increased
by the notional weighted average cost of capital of the business (which will be at least 8% per annum
compounded). If the business’ value is lower than its adjusted base valuation at the end of the performance
period, there will be no reward pool. To the extent that the business’ value exceeds its adjusted base valuation at
the end of the performance period, 10% of the excess growth in value goes into the reward pool.

Part of the reward pool was paid to participants up to the end of year three (31 March 2009), with a portion
payable (less payments made at end of year three) to participants at the end of year four (31 March 2010) and the
balance in full at the end of year five (31 March 2011). Measurement of the size of the reward pool is carried out
every six months to correspond with the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s accounting periods. However,
other than in the case of awards held by participants who ceased employment as “good leavers”, no awards
vested until the end of year three. In the event of a potential payment to an individual in excess of £20 million,
the deferral period would be extended until 31 March 2012 or for a period of up to one year following a vesting
event, if earlier.

2.17 Tax

Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income
statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in invested capital, in which case it is
recognised in invested capital.

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using rates that have been enacted or
substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of prior years.

Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated historical financial information,
except where the difference arises from:

    - the initial recognition of goodwill; or

    - the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination,
affecting neither accounting nor taxable profit.

Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the temporary differences
reverse, based on rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available
against which the temporary differences can be utilised.

Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint
ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable
future.

2.18 Provisions

Provisions are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount. They are recognised when the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely than
not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.

Provisions are presented in the statement of financial position at the present value of the estimated future
outflows expected to be required to settle the obligation. The discount rate is the pre-tax rate reflecting the
assessment of the settlement date. Provision charges and reversals are recognised in the income statement.
Discount unwinding is recognised as a finance expense.

Provisions are recognised for unavoidable lease payments in onerous contracts as the difference between the
rentals due and any income expected to be derived from the vacant properties being sublet. Redundancy
provisions, relating to both continuing and discontinued operations, comprise employee termination payments.
Legal provisions comprise legal fees and, where appropriate, expected settlement costs.

2.19 Revenue recognition

Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group revenue, which excludes discounts, value added tax and similar sales taxes,
represents the amount receivable in respect of services provided to customers. It includes sales to joint ventures
but does not include sales by joint ventures or sales between Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group companies.
Revenue is recognised only when payment is probable.

Revenue from services is recognised as the services are provided. Revenue from service contracts that cover
periods of greater than 12 months is recognised in the income statement in proportion to the services delivered at
the reporting date. In respect of services invoiced in advance, amounts are deferred until provision of the service.

Amounts payable by and to other telecommunications operators are recognised as the services are provided.
Charges are negotiated separately and are subject to continual review. Revenue generated through the provision
of these services is accounted for gross of any amounts payable to other telecommunications operators for
interconnect fees.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group earns revenue from the transmission of content and traffic on its
network originated by third party providers. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group assesses whether revenue
should be recorded gross as principal or net as agent, based on the features of such arrangements including the
following indicators:

    - whether the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group holds itself out as an agent;

    - establishment of the price;

    - provision of customer remedies;

    - performance of part of the service; and

    - assumption of credit risk.

Revenue from sales of telecommunications equipment is recognised upon delivery to the customer.

The total consideration on arrangements with multiple revenue generating activities (generally the sale of
telecommunications equipment and ongoing service) is allocated to those components that are separable based on
the estimated fair value of the components.

Revenue arising from the provision of other services, including maintenance contracts, is recognised evenly over
the periods in which the service is provided.

2.20 Dividend income

Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established. Dividend income is included
within finance income.

2.21 Interest income

Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate
applicable.

2.22 Exceptional items

Exceptional items are material items which derive from individual events that fall within the ordinary activities
of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group that are identified as exceptional items by virtue of their size, nature
or incidence. Further detail on exceptional items is set out in note 5 and in the relevant note for each item.

**3.** **Critical accounting estimates and judgments**

In the preparation of the consolidated historical financial information, a number of estimates and assumptions
have been made relating to the performance and the financial position of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group. Results may differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. The
Directors consider that the following discussion addresses the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s most
critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the presentation of its consolidated
financial performance and position. These particular policies require subjective and complex judgements, often
as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are uncertain.

3.1 Valuation of assets for purchase accounting

Where the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group undertakes business combinations, the cost of acquisition is
allocated to tangible and other identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired and assumed by reference to
their estimated fair values at the time of acquisition. The remaining amount is recorded as goodwill. Any value
assigned to the identifiable assets is determined by reference to an active market, independent appraisal or
estimate by management based on cash flow projections. The latter situation includes estimates and judgements
regarding expectations for the economic useful lives of the products and technology acquired. In this situation,
where appropriate, third party valuation specialists are involved.

3.2 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group assigns useful lives and residual values to property, plant and
equipment based on periodic studies of actual asset lives and the intended use for those assets. Changes in
circumstances such as technological advances, prospective economic utilisation and physical condition of the
assets concerned could result in the actual useful lives or residual values differing from initial estimates. Where
the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group determines that the useful life of property, plant and equipment should
be shortened or residual value reduced, it depreciates the net carrying amount in excess of the residual value over
the revised remaining useful life, thereby increasing depreciation expense. Any change in an asset’s life or
residual value is reflected in the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s historical financial information when the
change in estimate is determined.

3.3 Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets

The Directors assess the impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (excluding goodwill)
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable or
otherwise as required by accounting standards. Factors that are considered important and which could trigger an
impairment review include the following:

    - obsolescence or physical damage;

    - significant changes in technology and regulatory environments;

    - significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;

    - significant changes in the use of its assets or the strategy for its overall business;

    - significant negative industry or economic trends; and

    - significant decline in its share price for a sustained period and its market capitalisation relative to net
book value.

In addition, the Directors test goodwill at least annually for impairment.

The identification of impairment indicators, the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of the
recoverable amount for assets or cash generating units require significant judgement.

3.4 Revenue recognition

Judgement is required in assessing the application of the principles of revenue recognition in respect of Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group revenues. This includes presentation of revenue as principal or as agent in respect of
income received from transmission of content provided by third parties.

3.5 Receivables valuation

The valuation allowance for trade receivables reflects the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s estimates of
losses arising from the failure or inability of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s customers to make
required payments. The allowance is based on the ageing of customer accounts, customer credit-worthiness and
the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s historical write-off experience. Changes to the allowance may be
required if the financial condition of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s customers improves or
deteriorates. An improvement in financial condition may result in lower actual write-offs. Historically, changes
to the estimate of losses have not been material to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s financial position
and performance.

3.6 Customer and supplier commitments

The nature of the telecommunications industry is such that estimates are often required to be made in relation to
customer or supplier commitments, the final outcome of which may not be known for some time. It uses
estimates of price or usage to determine the revenue and expense recognised in any period. These estimates are
periodically adjusted to reflect actual pricing or usage as such information becomes available or is agreed. As
issues arise or are resolved, accruals are created or released as appropriate—the net impact of this is included in
operating profit within the relevant line item.

3.7 Interconnection with other operators

As part of the normal course of business, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group interconnects with other
telecommunications operators. In certain instances it uses estimates to determine the amount of revenue
receivable from or expense payable to these other operators. The prices at which these services are charged are
sometimes regulated and may be subject to retrospective adjustment. Estimates are used in assessing the likely
impact of these adjustments.

Adjustments to interconnect estimates are taken to operating profit in the period in which the adjustments are
made.

3.8 Taxation

The tax charge is the sum of the total current and deferred tax charges or credits. The calculation of the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group’s total tax charge involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of certain
items where the tax treatment cannot be finally determined until a resolution has been reached with the relevant
tax authority or, if necessary, through a formal legal process. The final resolution of some of these items may
give rise to material income statement and/or cash flow variances.

The resolution of issues is not always within the control of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group and is often
dependent on the efficiency of the administrative and legal processes in the relevant tax jurisdictions in which the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group operates. Issues can, and often do, take many years to resolve. Payments in
respect of tax liabilities for an accounting period result from payments on account and on the final resolution of
open items. As a result there can be substantial differences between the tax charge in the income statement and
tax payments.

3.9 Recognition of deferred tax assets

The recognition of deferred tax assets is based upon whether it is probable that sufficient and suitable taxable
profits will be available in the future, against which the reversal of temporary differences can be deducted.
Recognition therefore involves judgement regarding the future financial performance of the particular legal entity
or tax group in which the deferred tax asset has been recognised.

3.10 Provisions

A provision is recognised when there is a present (legal or constructive) obligation in respect of a past event as
explained in the accounting policy in note 2.18. Judgement is required to quantify such amounts.

AF-22


-----

3.11 Pensions

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group provides several defined benefit pension schemes for its employees.
The asset (or liability) recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension
plans represents the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligations and asset
ceiling adjustments at the reporting date. The expected cost of providing these defined benefit pensions will
depend on an assessment of such factors as:

    - the life expectancy of the members;

    - the length of service;

    - the rate of salary progression;

    - the rate of return earned on assets in the future;

    - the rate used to discount future pension liabilities; and

    - future inflation rates.

The assumptions used by the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group are set out in note 29 and are estimates chosen
from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which may not necessarily be borne out in practice but are
comparable to the median estimates in this regard used by other FTSE 100 companies. Changes to these
assumptions could materially affect the size of the defined benefit schemes’ liabilities and assets disclosed in
note 29.

3.12 Fair value estimation

The basis of determining fair values is set out in note 2.9. Where market values are not available, fair values are
based on valuation methodologies which require inputs and forecasts to be made. Judgement is required in
determining the appropriate assumptions underlying those inputs and forecasts.

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation
techniques. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group uses a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are
based on market conditions existing at each reporting date.

Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments are used for long-term loans. Other techniques,
such as estimated discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange market rates at the
reporting date.

The nominal value less valuation adjustments of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their
fair values. The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future
contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group for similar financial instruments.

3.13 Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)

The charge calculated in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits requires estimates of the valuation of the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group to determine the obligation for the LTIP. The estimates require the use of a
number of assumptions which, by their nature, are subjective.

Revenues are allocated to a geographical region based on the location in which the telecommunications services
were delivered. It does not follow necessarily that the international telecommunications traffic transiting the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s networks originates in that location. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group does not have access to information on the original source or ultimate destination of international
telecommunications traffic.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group does not have any customers from which revenue exceeds 10% of
Group revenue.

**13. Earnings per share**

Basic earnings per ordinary share is based on the profit or loss for the period attributable to ordinary shareholders
and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding. The weighted average number of ordinary
shares outstanding used to calculate earnings per share is based on the number of shares expected on listing of
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Ordinary Shares. The shares expected on listing of Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Ordinary Shares will be equal to the outstanding shares of Cable and Wireless plc prior to the Demerger.
Therefore, these shares are considered to be the most appropriate denominator on which to compute earnings per
share for the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group.

**14. Impairment review**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group assessed the impairment of property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying value may not be
recoverable or otherwise as required by accounting standards. Factors that are considered important, which could
trigger an impairment review, are set out in note 3.3.

**_Goodwill_**

_Six months ended 30 September 2009_

There were no events or changes in circumstances during this period to indicate that the carrying value of
property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets had been impaired.

AF-31


-----

_Year ended 31 March 2009_

As required by IFRS 3, a review of the carrying value of goodwill has been performed at each year end. In
performing these reviews, the recoverable amount of goodwill has been determined by reference to the higher of
the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use of the continuing operations of the related businesses. No
impairments were required in any of the periods presented.

At 31 March 2009, including the acquired Thus business, which was integrated into the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group during the period, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group had one cash generating unit. It
generates revenue through an integrated network for which the business is unable to identify relevant cash flows
separately. Goodwill of £784 million was allocated to this business at 31 March 2009 (31 March 2008—
£431 million, 31 March 2007—£421 million). A discounted cash flow analysis was performed using a five year
business projection which was extended using a terminal value growth rate of 1% (31 March 2008—1%,
31 March 2007—1.2%) and a pre-tax discount rate of 10% (31 March 2008—9%, 31 March 2007—10%). This
analysis indicated that the carrying value of the goodwill was supported and no impairment charge was required.
The key assumptions on which the projected cash flows are based relate to revenue growth and the level of
capital expenditure required to maintain the network at its current level. These assumptions were determined
using a combination of long-term trends, industry forecasts and in-house estimates.

The goodwill’s value in use would not support the carrying value of the goodwill if earnings decreased or
maintenance capital expenditure increased by more than £50 million per year; or the discount rate increased by
more than 6 percentage points.

**_Other non-current assets and other intangibles_**

_Six months ended 30 September 2009, year ended 31 March 2009 and year ended 31 March 2008_

There were no events or changes in circumstances during these periods to indicate that the carrying value of
property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets had been impaired.

_Year ended 31 March 2007_

In 2006/07, redundant IT assets of £13 million (£11 million software, £2 million fixed assets) were written off
following the change in Cable & Wireless Access strategy from a consumer to a wholesale business. There were
no other events or changes in circumstances during this period to indicate that the carrying value of property,
plant and equipment and other intangible assets had been impaired.

acquisition of Energis. In March 2008, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group paid £49 million satisfying the
contingent consideration under this agreement which has now expired (see note 35). This represented £47 million
of additional goodwill (of which £37 million was accrued in 2006/07) and £2 million of interest on the
consideration.

The maximum exposure to credit risk for receivables was equal to the carrying value of those financial
instruments. There was no material difference between the carrying value and fair value of receivables during the
periods presented.

Concentrations of credit risks with respect to trade receivables were small as the Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group customer base was large and unrelated. Receivables predominantly related to large corporate entities,
governments and other telecommunications operators.

Customer risk procedures varied depending on the size or type of customer. These procedures included such
activities as credit checks, payment history analysis and credit approval limits. Based on these procedures,
management assessed the credit quality of those receivables that were neither past due nor impaired as low risk.
There have been no significant changes to the composition of receivables counterparties within the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group that indicate this would change in the future. In FY 2006/07 and FY 2007/08 there
were no material changes in the markets in which the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group operates that indicated
an increased credit risk on receivables that are neither past due nor impaired. In FY 2008/09 and H1 2009/10,
there was an economic downturn in markets in which the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group operates. This
would indicate an increased credit risk on receivables that are neither past due nor impaired. However,
management have assessed this risk and, after providing additional valuation allowance where necessary,
continue to support the assessment of credit quality as low risk.

Due to the nature of the telecommunications industry, balances relating to interconnection with other carriers
often have lengthy settlement periods. Generally, interconnection agreements with major carriers resulted in
receivables and payables balances with the same counterparty. Industry practice is that receivable and payable
amounts relating to interconnection revenue and costs for a defined period are agreed between counterparties and
settled on a net basis. Included within receivables at 30 September 2009 are amounts relating to interconnection
with other carriers of £291 million (31 March 2009—£256 million, 31 March 2008—£244 million, 31 March
2007—£228 million). In most circumstances, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has a corresponding
payable to the receivable counterparty.

There were no amounts held as collateral for trade and other receivables balances.

An analysis of the trade receivables valuation allowance for the periods presented is as follows:

Capital losses at 30 September 2009 were £5,192 million (31 March 2009—£5,192 million, 31 March 2008—£nil,
31 March 2007—£nil). Other losses principally arose in overseas holding companies and the opportunity to realise
benefits from them was considered remote.

Deferred tax was not provided on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and joint ventures where the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group controlled the timing of remittance and it was probable that the temporary difference
would not reverse in the foreseeable future. As at 30 September 2009, the aggregate amount of temporary
differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches and joint ventures for which deferred tax
liabilities have not been recognised was £18 million (31 March 2009—£nil, 31 March 2008—£8 million,
31 March 2007—£8 million). These temporary differences related to unremitted earnings.

**_Property_**

In the periods presented, provision was made for the lower of the best estimate of the unavoidable lease
payments or cost of exit in respect of vacant properties. Unavoidable lease payments represented the difference
between the rentals due and any income expected to be derived from the vacant properties being sub-let. The
provision was expected to be used over the shorter of the period to exit and the lease contract life.

**_Redundancy_**

In the periods presented, redundancy provisions included the total employee related costs of redundancies
announced prior to the balance sheet date. Amounts provided for and spent during the periods presented
primarily related to the restructuring of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s business subsequent to the
acquisition of THUS Group plc in October 2008 and Energis in November 2005. The provision was expected to
be used within one year.

**_Network and asset retirement obligations_**

In the periods presented, provision was made for the best estimate of the unavoidable costs associated with
redundant leased network capacity. These provisions were expected to be used over the shorter of the period to
exit and the lease contract life.

Provision was also made for the best estimate of the asset retirement obligation associated with office sites,
technical sites, domestic and sub-sea cabling. This provision was expected to be used at the end of the life of the
related asset on which the obligation arose. Amounts utilised in the periods presented related predominantly to
cash expenditure against unavoidable costs associated with redundant network capacity.

**_Other_**

Other provisions during the periods presented included the costs of business transformation initiatives.

**29. Retirement benefits obligations**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group operated pension and other retirement schemes, which covered the
majority of employees in the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group. These schemes included both defined benefit
schemes, where retirement benefits were based on the employee’s remuneration and length of service, and
defined contribution schemes, where retirement benefits reflected the accumulated value of agreed contributions
paid by, and in respect of, employees. Contributions to the defined benefit schemes were made in accordance
with the recommendations of independent actuaries who value the schemes. The main UK defined benefit
pension scheme operated by the Cable & Wireless Group was closed to new members in 1998.

**_Defined contribution schemes_**

The pension cost for H1 2009/10 for the defined contribution schemes of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group was £7 million (FY 2008/09—£12 million, FY 2007/08—£11 million, FY 2006/07—£10 million), of
which £6 million (FY 2008/09—£10 million, FY 2007/08—£10 million, FY 2006/07—£9 million) was for the
main UK scheme operated by the Cable & Wireless Group.

**_Defined benefit schemes_**

_Main UK defined benefit pension scheme operated by the Cable & Wireless Group—funding valuation_

Historically, the main UK defined benefit pension scheme operated by the Cable & Wireless Group has been
allocated between the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group and the Cable & Wireless Communications Group on
a ratio of 80:20 (see note 2.1 for further information). The figures below relate to the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group’s 80% allocation unless otherwise stated.

The latest triennial actuarial valuation was carried out by Watson Wyatt Limited as at 31 March 2007. The
projected unit credit method was used and the principal actuarial assumptions adopted were that the annual rate
of inflation would be 3.1% and that future increases in pensionable earnings would be 4.1% per annum;
investments held in respect of pensions before they become payable would average 6.2% annual rate of return;
investments held in respect of pensions after they become payable would average 4.9% annual rate of return; and
pensions would increase at an annual rate of 3% for fixed rate increasing pensions and 3.1% for inflation related

pensions. As at 31 March 2007, the value of the assets represented approximately 99% of the actuarial value of
benefits due to members calculated on the basis of pensionable earnings and service at 31 March 2007 on an
ongoing basis and allowing for projected increases in pensionable earnings.

The assumptions regarding current mortality rates in retirement were set having regard to the actual experience of
the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund’s pensioners and dependents over the five years ended 31 March
2007. In addition, allowance was made for future mortality improvements in line with medium cohort projections
of the 1992 mortality series tables published by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, subject to a minimum
annual rate of improvement of 1.5% .

Based on these assumptions, the life expectancies of pensioners aged 60 are as follows:

**_31 March_**
**_2009_**

The actuarial valuation revealed that the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s share of the deficit at 31 March
2007 in the defined benefit section was £12 million on the basis of the funding assumptions adopted by the
actuary. A £15 million contribution made to the scheme by Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group on 28 March
2008 was calculated on the basis of the £12 million deficit at 31 March 2007, together with the interest cost that
accrued on this amount during the year and the back-dating of the increased employer’s contribution rate to the
valuation date. As a result of the £15 million contribution and the corresponding contribution by the Cable &
Wireless Communications Group, the scheme was fully funded on an ongoing basis, based on the 2007 valuation.

The actuarial valuation showed that based on long-term financial assumptions the contribution rate required to
meet the future benefit accrual was 33.2% of pensionable earnings (28.5% employer’s and 4.7% employee’s).
This contribution rate will be reviewed when the next independent actuarial valuation is carried out, which will
be based on the position at 31 March 2010. The terms of the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund Trust Deed
also allow the Trustees or Cable and Wireless plc to call for a valuation at any time. The future service
contribution rate included an allowance of 3% for administration expenses, excluding the Pension Protection
Fund (PPF) levy. The PPF levy due for H1 2009/10 was £124,800 (FY 2008/09—£224,800, FY 2007/08—
£271,200, FY 2006/07—£207,200). Employers therefore paid a total contribution rate in H1 2009/10 of 29.4%
(FY 2008/09 —29.3%, FY 2007/08—29.3%, FY 2006/07—22.3%), or £4.2 million (FY 2008/09—£8.5 million,
FY 2007/08—£9.4 million, FY 2006/07—£8.4 million).

As part of the agreement of the valuation assumptions with the Trustees, the Cable & Wireless Group has agreed
to a contingent funding agreement, including a requirement to provide certain financial information on a semiannual basis to allow the trustees to monitor the Cable & Wireless Group’s financial performance. Should the
Cable & Wireless Group’s projected EBITDA fall below an agreed level, and the cash and committed facilities
(net of any prior ranking creditors) available to the Cable & Wireless Group also fall below an agreed level, the
Cable & Wireless Group would provide security to the Trustees in the form of an escrow arrangement or bank
letter of credit for an amount equal to the shortfall against the agreed level of cash and committed facilities (net
of any prior ranking creditors).

During 2008/09, the pension trustees of the main UK defined benefit pension scheme operated by the Cable &
Wireless Group agreed a buy-in of the UK pensioner element of the scheme with Prudential Insurance. The
buy-in involved the purchase of a bulk annuity policy by the scheme under which Prudential Insurance assumed
responsibility for the benefits payable to the scheme’s UK pensioners with effect from 1 August 2008. The
pensioner liabilities and the matching annuity policy remain within the scheme. The total premium for the
annuity policy was approximately £1,000 million which the scheme settled with a combination of cash and assets
including an additional Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group contribution of £8 million.

Assumptions used by the actuary are best estimates from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which may
not necessarily be borne out in practice. The assumptions shown above for Other schemes represent a weighted
average of the assumptions used for the individual schemes, which similarly may not be borne out in practice.

A one year increase in the life expectancy assumptions would have increased the main UK defined benefit
pension scheme operated by the Cable & Wireless Group’s liabilities by approximately £27 million. The
corresponding increase in the value of assets due to the change in the estimated value of the annuity policy is £17
million. A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate used to value the scheme liabilities would have increased the
liabilities by around £66 million. The corresponding increase in the value of assets due to the change in the
estimated value of the annuity policy is £21 million. A 0.25% change in the assumed rate of salary increases
would have changed the liabilities by around £3 million.

Excluding the annuities, which are measured at the value of the obligation to which they relate, the overall expected
rate of return for each pension scheme is a weighted average of the expected asset return for each asset class. The
expected asset return for each asset class has been set as a best estimate of the long-term return that will be achieved
for the particular asset class in the country in question having regard to investment yields on the measurement date.

The main UK defined benefit pension scheme operated by the Cable & Wireless Group is closed to new entrants.
Under the projected unit credit method used for the valuation of liabilities, the current service cost will increase
when expressed as a percentage of pensionable payroll as the members of the scheme approach retirement.

The IAS 19 surplus or deficit of defined benefit funds is adjusted to reflect the future economic benefits available
in the form of a cash refund or a reduction in future contributions, allowing for minimum funding contributions
in accordance with IFRIC 14. Any adjustment to the surplus is recorded directly in equity. The effect of these
adjustments (described as asset ceiling adjustments) was £nil in H1 2009/10 (FY 2008/09—£nil, FY 2007/08—
£300 million, FY 2006/07—£nil).

The defined benefit expense has been included in employee benefit expenses (note 8).

The actual return on plan assets was a gain of £236 million in H1 2009/10, a loss of £325 million in FY 2008/09,
a gain of £56 million in FY 2007/08 and a gain of £125 million in FY 2006/07.

In H1 2009/10, net actuarial losses amounting to £240 million (FY 2008/09—losses of £359 million, FY
2007/08—gains of £227 million, FY 2006/07—gains of £90 million) were recognised directly in equity and are
presented in the statement of comprehensive income. In addition an actuarial gain of £nil (FY 2008/09—gain of
£300 million, FY 2007/08—loss of £300 million, FY 2006/07—£nil) was recognised in the statement of
comprehensive income due to the change in the effect of asset ceilings. The total amount recognised in the
statement of comprehensive income in the six months and cumulatively to 30 September 2009 was a loss of
£240 million and a loss of £227 million. The total amount recognised in the statement of comprehensive income
in the financial year and cumulatively to 31 March 2009 was a loss of £59 million (FY 2007/08—loss of
£73 million, FY 2006/07—gain of £90 million) and gain of £13 million (FY 2007/08—gain of £73 million, FY
2006/07—gain of £146 million) respectively.

**30. Capital management**

The capital of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group is equal to the capital investments received from the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group and movements in that invested capital.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s objective in managing capital is to maintain a capital structure that
optimises returns to shareholders having regard to the liquidity requirements and the relative cost of debt and
equity. It does not have any externally imposed requirement for managing capital, other than those imposed by
company law.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group manages its capital position in such a way as to optimise the weighted
average cost of debt and equity taking into account:

    - the liquidity required in the light of the projected funding requirements of the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group’s operating businesses with an appropriate level of contingency;

    - the level of financial strength required to maintain the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s terms of
trade taking account of its operational cash generation;

    - the relative post-tax cost of debt and equity; and

    - the extent to which external debt finance is, or is likely to be, available to the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group on acceptable terms.

This strategy remained unchanged in the periods presented.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group ensures that sufficient funds and distributable reserves are held to allow
payments of projected dividends to shareholders. This process is managed through the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group’s budget and five year forecast process.

**31. Share-based payments**

**_Share option schemes_**

The share option schemes in operation during the periods presented or having options outstanding as at the ends
of the periods presented, are as follows:

**_Cable & Wireless Employee Savings Related Share Option Scheme (UK SAYE) and Cable & Wireless_**
**_Global Savings Related Share Option Scheme (Global SAYE)_**

Under the UK SAYE, UK employees were invited to enter into a savings contract with a bank to save regular
monthly sums of between £5 and £250 for a period of either three, five or seven years. At the end of the savings
contract, the participant receives interest from the bank on their savings. The savings and the interest may then be
used to exercise an option over Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Shares, which are acquired at a discount of 20%
to the market value of Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Shares at the date of grant. The UK SAYE Scheme was
last offered in December 2003. Cable and Wireless plc extended the SAYE scheme to its overseas employees
through the Global SAYE. The Global SAYE was last offered in December 2004. In various of the Cable &
Wireless Group’s territories (excluding the United Kingdom) it operated along similar lines to the UK SAYE
with local variations to accommodate local legal and tax considerations.

**_Cable & Wireless Revenue Approved Share Option Scheme and Cable & Wireless Senior Employees’ Share_**
**_Option Scheme_**

Prior to July 2001, Cable and Wireless plc granted share options under the Cable & Wireless Senior Employees’
Share Option Scheme (SESOS) and the Cable & Wireless Revenue Approved Share Option Scheme (RESOS).
Options awarded under these plans between June 1999 and July 2001 were subject to performance conditions
based on Cable and Wireless plc’s TSR performance relative to the FTSE 100 Index, underpinned by real growth
in EBITDA and revenue. TSR is share price growth adjusted for dividends and capital actions. TSR performance
was averaged over a three month period at the beginning and end of the performance period. This moderated the
effect of short-term share price volatility. For full vesting, the TSR performance of Cable and Wireless plc must
have achieved at least upper quartile level against the FTSE 100 between the third and fifth anniversaries of the
date of grant. Half vesting applied for TSR at the median level, with a sliding scale between median and upper
quartile. If the performance conditions were not met by the fifth anniversary of the date of grant, the options

would have lapsed. None of these options achieved their performance conditions and therefore they have all
lapsed. Options granted under RESOS and SESOS before June 1999 became exercisable if growth in Cable and
Wireless plc’s published earnings per share (excluding exceptional items) measured over any period of three
consecutive financial years, commencing not earlier than the financial year in which the option was granted,
exceeded by not less than 6% of the percentage growth of the Retail Price Index over the same three year period.
All such options became exercisable in full.

No further grants will be made under the RESOS and SESOS plans and there are no outstanding options under
these plans.

**_Options under the Cable & Wireless Incentive Plan 2001 (approved and unapproved)_**

The level of any share option award is determined by the Cable & Wireless Remuneration Committee each year
by reference to total remuneration within a market peer group, subject to an overriding annual limit of ten times
salary for executive directors of Cable and Wireless plc.

The vesting of share options awarded to the executive directors of Cable and Wireless plc and to all employees
outside the United States is subject to relative TSR performance conditions. For options granted before May
2004, full vesting occurs only if the TSR performance of Cable and Wireless plc meets or exceeds the upper
quartile between the third and fifth anniversaries of the date of grant. Where TSR performance meets the median,
50% of the initial award vests. A sliding scale operates between median and upper quartile, and nothing vests for
TSR performance below the median. If performance conditions have not been met by the fifth anniversary of the
date of grant, the option lapses. For options granted from May 2004, the re-testing of performance conditions for
share options granted from that date will cease. If performance conditions for these options have not been met by
the third anniversary of the date of grant the option lapses. For options granted from June 2005, 33.33% of
options vest where TSR performance meets the median. 100% of options vest where TSR performance meets or
exceeds the upper quartile, with a straight line proportion vesting between those levels. In addition, the Cable &
Wireless Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that the underlying financial performance of the Cable &
Wireless Group warrants the release of the Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Shares. All outstanding options
under the IP 2001 are currently vested.

**_The Cable & Wireless Employee Share Ownership Trust (Cable & Wireless ESOT)_**

The Cable & Wireless ESOT is a discretionary trust, which has been funded by loans from Cable and Wireless
plc to acquire Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Shares. At 30 September 2009 the Cable & Wireless ESOT held
20,599,199 Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Shares (31 March 2009—28,322,351, 31 March 2008—26,859,407,
31 March 2007—36,792,665) with a cost of £42 million (31 March 2009—£59 million, 31 March 2008—
£73 million, 31 March 2006/07—£100 million) and a market value of £30 million (31 March 2009—£40 million,
31 March 2008—£40 million, 31 March 2007—£61 million).

The costs of running the Cable & Wireless ESOT are included in the profit and loss account as they accrue. The
trustees of the Cable & Wireless ESOT may notionally allocate Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Shares annually
to executive directors of Cable and Wireless plc or other senior executives and other key employees. Cable and
Wireless plc Ordinary Shares are held in trust until such time as they may be transferred to employees in
accordance with the terms of Cable and Wireless plc’s share incentive plans details of which are given above and
below. The trustees of the Cable & Wireless ESOT may acquire Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Shares through
the issuance of new Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Shares, the transfer of Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary
Shares held in treasury or the purchase of existing Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Shares in issue. Surplus
Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Shares may be held to satisfy future awards. The Cable & Wireless ESOT has
waived its rights to dividends. At 30 September 2009, in respect of Cable & Wireless Worldwide employees
there were 2,344,626 Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Shares under performance share awards under the IP 2001
(31 March 2009—254,589, 31 March 2008—281,567, 31 March 2007—369,027), 1,708,481 Cable and Wireless
plc Ordinary Shares under restricted share awards (31 March 2009—4,731,605, 31 March 2008—6,615,422,
31 March 2007—7,962,664), 782,931 Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Shares under stock appreciation rights
(31 March 2009—839,810, 31 March 2008—414,583, 31 March 2007—193,531), 2,316,915 Cable and Wireless
plc Ordinary Shares under options under the IP 2001 (31 March 2009 –764,889, 31 March 2008—807,494,
31 March 2007—341,582) and nil Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Shares under awards under the DSTIP (31
March 2009—nil, 31 March 2008—13,390, 31 March 2007—38,625).

AF-51

**_Other equity instrument awards_**

_Deferred bonus scheme_

Selected senior executives were able voluntarily to defer between 10% and 50% of their post-tax senior
management bonus to purchase Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Shares, which were held in the Cable &
Wireless ESOT. Half of the purchased shares were held in the Cable & Wireless ESOT for a two year deferral
period and the remaining half were held in the Cable & Wireless ESOT for a three year deferral period.
Participants were awarded matching shares when the purchased shares vested at the end of the deferral periods.

No award has been made under the deferred bonus scheme since June 2004.

_Performance share awards under the IP 2001_

Under the IP 2001, executive directors of Cable and Wireless plc and other senior executives can receive awards
of performance shares at nil cost.

The vesting of performance shares is subject to either relative or absolute TSR performance conditions (see
performance conditions for share-based awards on page AF-52). A dividend award supplement applies to
performance shares. Dividends that would have been paid on the performance shares which vest, will be regarded
as having been re-invested in additional Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Shares.

_Cable & Wireless Restricted Share Plan (RSP 2005)_

The RSP 2005 provides for awards of restricted shares to executives and selected employees other than executive
directors of Cable and Wireless plc. Generally, 50% of any restricted shares awarded under the RSP 2005 vest
after one year with the remaining 50% vesting after three years.

_Restricted Shares under the IP 2001_

Restricted shares have also been used to award matching shares with performance conditions to executive
directors of Cable and Wireless plc who invested their own funds into Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Shares.
Attainment of these matching shares is dependent on the executive director continuing to hold the invested shares
and on meeting the required TSR performance conditions (if applicable). 100% of any matching shares awarded
vest after three years.

**_Performance conditions for share-based awards_**

The Cable & Wireless Remuneration Committee considers TSR is the main performance measure used in share
plans where performance conditions apply as it provides an objective external measure of financial performance
and also considers the underlying financial performance of Cable and Wireless plc at the end of the performance
period.

The Remuneration Committee considers that the best alignment of executives with shareholders is currently
through the use of absolute TSR performance measures.

**_Cash-based awards_**

_Stock appreciation rights plan under the IP 2001 and RSP 2005 (SARs)_

The SARs are used to replicate the plans described above, but rewards are delivered as a cash equivalent. SARs
are used in exceptional cases for countries in which tax or legal issues preclude the use of real shares or share
options.

**_Other schemes_**

_Cable & Wireless Share Purchase Plan (SPP)_

Cable and Wireless plc also offers its employees who are chargeable to income tax, under Section 15 Income Tax
(Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003, the SPP which is an HMRC approved share incentive plan. Under the SPP,
employees can contribute up to a value of £1,500 or 10% of salary each tax year (whichever is the lower), to buy
partnership shares in Cable and Wireless plc, and Cable and Wireless plc will offer a match of one share for each
partnership share purchased.

AF-52


-----

Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Shares are held in a UK resident trust and can be withdrawn from the trust at
any time, but there may be pay as you earn taxation and national insurance contributions payable in such events
if the Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary Shares have not been held in the trust for five years. Dividends on the
partnership and matching shares are reinvested in additional dividend shares.

**_UK Share Award_**

On 25 July 2006, all permanent employees and fixed-term contractors of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group
based in the United Kingdom were awarded a one off gift of £1,000 (gross) in Cable and Wireless plc Ordinary
Shares.

1 Weighted average remaining life relates to legal life of options not expected life.

There were no share options granted in H1 2009/10, FY 2008/09 or FY 2007/08. In FY 2006/07, 106,000 options
were granted with a weighted average fair value at the measurement date of 22 pence. The Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group computed the fair value of share option awards using the Monte Carlo pricing model. The
expected volatility was determined based on the statistical analysis of daily share prices over a historical period
equal to the expected lives of the options. Performance and other market conditions attached to awards were
reflected in the calculation of fair value as part of the Monte Carlo simulations.

Trading guarantees principally comprised performance bonds issued in the normal course of business,
guaranteeing that the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group would meet its obligations to complete projects in
accordance with the contractual terms and conditions. The nature of contracts included projects, service level
agreements, installation of equipment, surveys, purchase of equipment and transportation of materials. The
guarantees contained a clause that they would be terminated on final acceptance of work to be done under the
contract.

Historically, the Cable & Wireless Group has provided guarantees to third parties in respect of trading contracts
between these third parties and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group. These guarantees amounted to £502m
and are included in the table above. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group has agreed a fee schedule with the
Cable & Wireless Communications Group for the benefit of these guarantees post-Demerger. Further, the Cable
& Wireless Worldwide Group has indemnified the Cable & Wireless Communications Group for these
guarantees.

Other guarantees included guarantees for financial obligations principally in respect of borrowings, leases and
letters of credit.

**35. Business combinations and acquisitions of non-controlling interests**

**_THUS Group plc_**

From the date of its acquisition on 1 October 2008 to 31 March 2009, Thus contributed £237 million to Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group revenue and a loss of £17 million to Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group profit after
tax. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 April 2008 the contribution to Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group
revenue would have been £518 million and the contribution to Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group profit after
tax would have been a loss of £34 million. Based on its published accounts, revenue from continuing operations
for THUS Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2008 was £576 million (31 March 2007—£533 million). Loss
after tax for the year ended 31 March 2008 was £6 million (31 March 2007—profit of £55 million).

The Directors made a provisional assessment of the fair values of the assets and liabilities at 31 March 2009. This
assessment was updated at 30 September 2009 to adjust for new information regarding the previously assessed
balances. The fair values, both provisional and final, were as follows:

payables.

The acquiree’s carrying amounts were previously recorded in accordance with IFRS.

**_Apollo_**

On 1 April 2008 the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group gained full management control of Apollo which was
previously accounted for as a joint venture. Goodwill arising on this business combination amounted to £9
million. The net liabilities acquired were £9 million (including £4 million of cash and cash equivalents). In
2008/09, Apollo contributed £7 million to revenue and £nil to profit after tax. On 13 November 2008 the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group increased its effective interest in Apollo from 55% to 60% for consideration of £nil.
This transaction resulted in £nil of non-controlling interests transferred to retained earnings and a £nil increase in
other reserves.

There were no subsidiaries acquired during 2006/07 and 2007/08.

**_Energis contingent consideration_**

As part of the Energis acquisition on 11 November 2005, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group agreed to pay
contingent consideration of between £nil and a maximum of £80 million. The amount of contingent consideration
was linked to Cable and Wireless plc’s share price and was to be satisfied, at the Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group’s option, in either cash or shares of Cable and Wireless plc. Payments were based on a ratio of
£1.25 million for every one penny by which the maximum three-month volume weighted average Cable and
Wireless plc share price exceeded the reference price of 135 pence. Any payments were to begin in March 2008
and were payable monthly until December 2008. Any payments were based upon Cable & Wireless’ volume
weighted average share price for the three months prior to any relevant payment date.

In 2008/09, no additional goodwill was recognised in connection with the contingent consideration since the
payment criteria were not met. In 2007/08, an additional £10 million of goodwill was recognised due to
contingent consideration. In March 2008, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group paid £49 million satisfying the
contingent consideration under this agreement which has now expired.

**36. Related party transactions**

**_Transactions with joint ventures_**

All trade transactions with joint ventures arose in the normal course of business and primarily related to fees for

transactions with joint ventures during the periods presented.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group received no dividends from joint ventures in the periods presented.

**_Transactions with key management employees_**

**37. Licences**

In a number of countries the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group holds licences to operate. These licences take a
variety of forms and their terms, rights and obligations vary significantly. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group assumes that it will renew licences as they expire. Previous history indicates this is the most likely
outcome. Were renewal not to occur, in most cases the business or its assets would be transferred to the new
operator or government at fair or net book value. In a small number of locations, transfer is at a value below net
book value. In these places the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group monitors closely the likelihood of licence
renewal in order to ensure that should a licence not be renewed, the business’ assets have been written down to
their recoverable value at the point of transfer.

There were no significant changes to the terms of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s licences in the
periods presented.

**38. Legal proceedings**

In the ordinary course of business, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group is involved in litigation proceedings,
regulatory claims, investigations and reviews. The facts and circumstances relating to particular cases are
evaluated in determining whether it is more likely than not that there will be a future outflow of funds and, once
established, whether a provision relating to a specific case is necessary or sufficient. Accordingly, significant
management judgement relating to contingent liabilities is required since the outcome of litigation is difficult to
predict. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group does not expect the ultimate resolution of the actions to which
it is a party to have a significant adverse impact on the financial position of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group.

**39. Subsidiaries**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group comprises a large number of companies and it is not practical to include
all of them in this list. The list therefore only includes those companies whose results or financial position, in the
opinion of the Directors, principally affects the figures shown in the historical financial information.

**40. Financial risk management**

**_Treasury policy_**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk,
including currency risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group’s overall risk management programme seeks to minimise potential adverse effects of the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group’s financial performance.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s treasury operations are managed on the basis of policies and
authorities approved by the Cable and Wireless plc Board. These policies are expected to be adopted by the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group in substantially the same form post-Demerger. Day to day management of
treasury activities is delegated to the Chief Financial Officer and the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group
Treasurer (together, Treasury) within specified financial limits for each type of transaction and counterparty.

AF-59


-----

To the extent that subsidiaries undertake treasury transactions, these are governed by Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group policies and delegated authorities. Material subsidiary positions are monitored by Treasury.
Where appropriate, transactions are reported to the Board. The key responsibilities of the Treasury function
include funding, investment of surplus cash and the management of interest rate and foreign currency risk. The
majority of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s cash resources and borrowings are managed centrally.

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group may, from time to time, use derivatives such as forward foreign
exchange contracts in the management of its foreign currency and interest rate exposures. The use of these
instruments would be in accordance with strategies agreed from time to time by Treasury, subject to policies
approved by the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group Board. Derivatives are not used for trading or speculative
purposes and all derivative transactions and positions are monitored and reported to the Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Group Board on a regular basis.

**_Exchange rate risk_**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group trades in several countries, however, the majority of the Cable &
Wireless Worldwide Group’s revenue is earned in pounds sterling. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s
main foreign currency exposure relates to movements in exchange rates for foreign currency payments. Exchange
risk is measured on the basis of net current or future foreign currency payments.

Where appropriate the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group manages its exposure to movements in exchange
rates on a net basis and uses forward foreign exchange contracts and other derivative instruments to reduce the
exposures created where currencies do not naturally offset in the short-term. The Cable & Wireless Worldwide
Group will undertake hedges to minimise the exposure to individual transactions that create significant foreign
exchange exposures for the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group where appropriate. The reported results of the
Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.

**_Interest rate risk_**

The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group is exposed to movements in interest rates on its surplus cash balances.
The Treasury function may seek to reduce volatility by fixing a proportion of this interest rate exposure whilst
taking account of prevailing market conditions as appropriate. There were no interest rate derivatives in place as
at 30 September 2009.

A one percentage point lowering of interest rates will have a £2 million impact on the income received from the
surplus cash balances of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group and a £1 million impact on debt with floating
interest rates. The impact on equity is limited to the impact on the income statement.

**_Credit risk_**

Cash deposits and similar financial instruments give rise to credit risk, which represents the loss that would be
recognised if a counterparty failed to perform as contracted. Management seeks to reduce this risk by ensuring
the counterparties to all but a small proportion of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s financial instruments
are entities rated A1 short-term and/or AA- (or better) long-term by Standard & Poor’s (or equivalent by
Moody’s and/or Fitch). The credit rating of these counterparties is monitored on a continuing basis.

The types of instrument used for investment of funds are prescribed in Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group
treasury policies approved by the Board. These policies contain limits on exposure to any one counterparty.

Credit risk on receivables is discussed in note 19.

**_Liquidity risk_**

At 30 September 2009, the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group had cash and cash equivalents of £150 million
(31 March 2009—£144 million, 31 March 2008—£19 million, 31 March 2007—£15 million). These amounts are
highly liquid and are a component of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s overall liquidity and capital
resources. An analysis of the maturity of financial instruments is contained in note 24.

Liquidity forecasts are produced on a regular basis to ensure the utilisation of current facilities is optimised, to
ensure that covenant compliance targets and that medium-term liquidity is maintained and for the purpose of
identifying long-term strategic funding requirements. The Directors also regularly assess the balance of capital
and debt funding of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group.

The majority of the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group’s cash is held centrally and is predominantly invested in
short-term bank deposits.
