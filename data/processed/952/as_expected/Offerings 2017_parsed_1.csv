In addition, the Company may, in its sole option, carry out any transactions in order to effect, or otherwise reasonably related to, the transactions contemplated for the Group Refinancing Transactions.

The Notes will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is secured by property and assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such indebtedness. On the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured by (i) a charge over all bank accounts of the Issuer (other than the Issuer Profit Account (as defined herein)) (the “Issuer Bank Account Charge”); and (ii) an assignment over the Issuer’s rights under the Proceeds Loan, the Proceeds Loan Agreement, and any Additional Proceeds Loan (as defined herein) that may be incurred in the future, including the Issuer’s rights in respect of the Proceeds Loan Guarantees (as defined below) (the “Proceeds Loan Assignment”, together with the Issuer Bank Account Charge, the “Notes Collateral)”.

The Proceeds Loan will be effective subordinated to any of the existing and future indebtedness of the New Proceeds Loan Borrower that is secured by liens senior to the liens securing the Proceeds Loan (if any), or secured by property or assets that secure such indebtedness but that do not secure the Proceeds Loan, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such indebtedness. Pursuant to the Proceeds Loan Borrower Change, the Initial Proceeds Loan Guarantees provided by the Initial Proceeds Loan Guarantors will be released and the Proceeds Loan will be guaranteed by the direct holding company of the New Proceeds Loan Borrower (such direct holding company, the “New Senior Debt Parent”, in its capacity as a guarantor of the Proceeds Loan, the “New Proceeds Loan Parent",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

The New Proceeds Loan Obligors, the Initial Proceeds Loan Obligors and any additional entity that accedes to the Proceeds Loan pursuant to the Proceeds Loan Agreement as an obligor are (as the context may require), collectively, the “Proceeds Loan Obligors”. Unless the CWC Group Assumption takes place, none of the Proceeds Loan Obligors or any of their respective subsidiaries will guarantee or provide any credit support for Issuer’s obligations under the Notes, other than the obligation of the Initial Proceeds Loan Borrower or (if the Proceeds Loan Borrower Change takes place) the New Proceeds Loan Borrower, as applicable, to make payments to the Issuer pursuant to the Proceeds Loan and the Proceeds Loan Agreement, the guarantee of such obligations by the other Proceeds Loan Obligors, and (if the Proceeds Loan Borrower Change takes place) the security granted under the New Senior Debt Obligor Share Pledge. The Proceeds Loan Obligors will agree in the Covenant Agreement to be bound by the covenants in the Indenture (other than payment obligations) that are applicable to them, as described in “Description of the Notes (Pre-Group Refinancing _Transactions)—Covenant Agreement” and “Description of the Notes (Post-Group Refinancing Transactions)— Covenant Agreement”.

The rights and remedies of the holders of the Notes against a Proceeds Loan Obligor upon any breach by such Proceed Loan Obligor of its obligations under the Covenant Agreement are limited to a right to instruct the Issuer or the Security Trustee (as defined herein) or their respective nominees, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Collateral Sharing Agreement (as defined herein and as further described in “Description of Other Indebtedness— _Collateral Sharing Agreement”), to accelerate or otherwise enforce the Issuer’s rights under the Proceeds Loan and the_ Proceeds Loan Guarantees in accordance with the terms thereof and the Collateral Sharing Agreement, and following the Proceeds Loan Borrower Change on the Group Refinancing Effective Date, to vote in connection with any enforcement of the collateral securing the Proceeds Loan (together with any other secured creditors sharing in such collateral) in accordance with the Holdco Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below). Unless the CWC Group Assumption takes place, the Collateral Sharing Agreement will regulate the rights, title and interest of the holders of the Notes and certain additional senior creditors in respect of the Notes Collateral. The Collateral Sharing Agreement will set out, among other things, the relative ranking of certain debt of the Issuer, the consent level of the senior creditors required to cast votes and exercise their rights in respect of consents, instructions, rights and remedies under the Proceeds Loan Agreement, in each case when enforcement action can be taken in respect of the Notes Collateral by the Security Trustee and the turnover provisions.

However, the Proceeds Loan and the Initial Proceeds Loan Guarantees will not be subject to the Existing Intercreditor Agreement. Concurrently with, or following the completion of both the refinancing in full of the Columbus Senior Notes and the refinancing in full of the Existing Senior Notes, the Company may amend and restate the Existing Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety into the New Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein) (the “Intercreditor Amendment and Restatement”). The Intercreditor Amendment and Restatement is not contingent upon the occurrence of the Group Refinancing Effective Date, and may, at the Company’s option, occur prior to the Group Refinancing Effective Date. From the New Intercreditor Effective Date until the Group Refinancing Effective Date (if it takes place), the Proceeds Loan and the Initial Proceeds Loan Guarantees will be converted from senior into senior subordinated claims, by becoming, among other things (i) contractually subordinated to any relevant senior secured Indebtedness (including the CWC Credit Facilities and the guarantees thereof), (ii) subject to payment blockage upon a senior default, (iii) subject to standstills on enforcement, and (iv) subject to release under certain circumstances pursuant to the New Intercreditor Agreement.

CWC defines EBITDA as earnings before net finance expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and impairment. Adjusted Segment EBITDA is the primary measure used by our chief operating decision maker to evaluate segment operating performance. Adjusted Segment EBITDA is also a key factor that is used by our internal decision makers to (i) determine how to allocate resources to segments and (ii) evaluate the effectiveness of our management for purposes of annual and other incentive compensation plans. As we use the term, “Adjusted Segment EBITDA” is defined as EBITDA before share-based compensation, provisions and provision releases related to significant litigation and other operating items. Other operating items include (i) gains and losses on the disposition of long-lived assets, (ii) third-party costs directly associated with successful and unsuccessful acquisitions and dispositions, including legal, advisory and due diligence fees, as applicable, (iii) other acquisition-related items, such as gains and losses on the settlement of contingent consideration, (iv) restructuring provisions or provision releases and (v) share of results of joint ventures and associates. Our internal decision makers believe Adjusted Segment EBITDA is a meaningful measure because it represents a transparent view of our recurring operating performance that is unaffected by our capital structure and allows management to (1) readily view operating trends, (2) perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between segments and (3) identify strategies to improve operating performance in the different countries in which we operate. Adjusted Segment EBITDA should be viewed as a measure of operating performance that is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, operating income, net earnings or loss, cash flow from operating activities and other IFRS measures of income or cash flows. We provide a reconciliation of Adjusted Segment EBITDA to operating income in this Offering Memorandum. See “Summary Financial and _Operating Data”._ xvi -----",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

The rights and remedies of the holders of the Notes against a New Proceeds Loan Obligor upon any breach by such New Proceed Loan Obligor of its obligations under the Covenant Agreement are limited to a right to instruct the Issuer or the Security Trustee or their respective nominees, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Collateral Sharing Agreement, to accelerate or otherwise enforce the Issuer’s rights under the Proceeds Loan and the Proceeds Loan Guarantees in accordance with the terms thereof and of the Collateral Sharing Agreement, and to vote in connection with any enforcement of the collateral securing the Proceeds Loans (together with any other secured creditors sharing in such collateral) in accordance with the Holdco Intercreditor Agreement 4. Following the Group Refinancing Effective Date, the New Senior Debt Obligor Share Pledge and the New Proceeds Loan Parent Guarantee and any other indebtedness which is secured, or will be secured, by the New Senior Debt Obligor Share Pledge, will be governed by the Holdco Intercreditor Agreement. 5. As part of the Group Refinancing Transactions, the Company may, at its option, form a wholly-owned direct or indirect subsidiary of the New Senior Debt Obligor under the laws of an Approved Key Jurisdiction (as illustrated in the above diagram, the “Company”), to which the Transferred Entities may be contributed (or otherwise transferred) from Cable & Wireless Limited. The Company will be a guarantor under the CWC Credit Facilities, but will not guarantee the Proceeds Loan or (if the CWC Group Assumption has taken place) the Notes. 6. At any time the New Proceeds Loan Borrower, may, at its sole option and in its sole discretion, instruct the Issuer to effect the CWC Group Assumption. Following such instruction (i) New Proceeds Loan Borrower, as the Fold-In Issuer will effect an assumption of the Notes and obligations thereunder and under the Indenture, and the Issuer will be released from its obligations under the Notes and the Indenture; (ii) such assumption and release will be deemed a repayment in full and cancellation of the Proceeds Loan; (iii) the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior basis by the New Proceeds Loan Parent Guarantor and (iv) the Notes Collateral will be released and the Notes will be secured by the a pledge or charge over the capital stock of the New Proceeds Loan Borrower, granted in favour of the Security Trustee for the benefit of the holders of the Notes. See “Description of the Fold-In Notes (Post-Group Refinancing Transactions)”. 7. Following the CWC Group Assumption, (i) the Notes will become the senior obligations of the New Proceeds Loan Borrower, as the Fold-In Issuer, and will be directly guaranteed on a senior basis by the New Senior Debt Parent (the “Fold-In Notes Parent",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

The Fold-In Issuer and the New Senior Debt Parent have not been designated, and once designated, may (among other things) be holding companies or finance companies with no material operations, assets or revenues of their own. 18 ----- 8. While the above diagram assumes that the New Proceeds Loan Borrower and (if the CWC Group Assumption takes place) the Fold-In Issuer will be a newly inserted entity into the Group and Cable & Wireless Limited will be the New Senior Debt Parent and the New Proceeds Loan Parent Guarantor, there can be no assurance that the Group Refinancing Transactions will be consummated in the manner illustrated. In particular, as part of the Group Refinancing Transactions, the Company may, at its option, elect to designate Cable & Wireless Limited or Cable & Wireless Communications Limited as the New Senior Debt Obligor, and accordingly, the entity which becomes the New Senior Debt Parent and New Proceeds Loan Parent Guarantor may be different from as illustrated above. 9. Assumes no changes to the CWC Regional Facilities or the 2019 Sterling Bonds as a result of the Group Refinancing Transactions. In addition, unless otherwise described in the preceding footnotes, the above diagram assumes no changes to the Issuer, its permitted activities (including as described in footnote (4) to the “Summary Corporate and Financing Structure—Pre-Group Refinancing _Transactions”), the Issue Date Arrangement Agreement and the other arrangements with and shareholding of the Issuer by the SPV_ Share Trustee. 10. Following the Group Refinancing Effective Date, the Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the “Description of the Notes (Post-Group _Refinancing Transactions)” and “Description of the Fold-In Notes (Post-Group Refinancing Transactions)” for purposes of the Proceeds_ Loan Agreement and the Indenture, as the case may be, will be different from the Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the CWC Credit Agreement) for purposes of the CWC Credit Agreement. It is contemplated that (unless otherwise specified therein) the Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the CWC Credit Agreement) will be Subsidiaries (as defined in the CWC Credit Agreement) of the Company. However, in order to consummate certain transactions which constitute part of the Group Refinancing Transactions as illustrated in the above diagram, we may require the consent of the administrative agent and the relevant lenders under the CWC Credit Agreement. There can be no assurance that the administrative agent and the relevant lenders will consent to all or any part of such transactions. See “Risks _Relating to the Group Refinancing Transactions—The consummation of the Group Refinancing Transactions is subject to significant uncertainties and risks and there is no assurance that the Group Refinancing Transactions will be consummated”._ 11. In addition or as an alternative to the transactions described in footnote 1 above, at the Company’s sole discretion, the Company may elect to refinance the Existing Senior Notes with proceeds of other Indebtedness (as defined in the applicable Description of the Notes) (including, without limitation, senior secured Indebtedness) incurred by Sable International Finance Limited, the New Senior Debt Obligor, and/or one or more other members of the Group, in each case in compliance with the applicable covenants and exceptions in the CWC Credit Agreement, the Indenture and the Covenant Agreement. Although such refinancing may be consummated as part of the Group Refinancing Transactions, such refinancing is not dependent upon the completion in full of the Group Refinancing Transactions, and may be consummated prior to the occurrence of the Group Refinancing Effective Date. In addition, there can be no assurance that such refinancing or the Group Refinancing Transactions will be consummated in the manner illustrated in the above diagram. See “Risk _Factors—Risks Relating to our Financial Profile—We may incur additional indebtedness prior to, or within a short time period following, the Issue Date of the Notes, which indebtedness could increase our leverage and may have terms that are more or less favorable than the terms of the Notes and our other existing indebtedness.”._ 19 ----- 20 ----- 21 ----- 22 ----- 23 -----",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

As of March 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount of our consolidated debt, together with our finance lease obligations, on an as adjusted basis, after giving effect to the Q2 2017 Financing Transactions, the Q3 2017 Financing Transactions, the issuance of the Notes and the application of proceeds thereof (including the funding of the Proceeds Loan, RCFs Partial Repayment and the Columbus Refinancing), aggregated $3,815.0 million. We believe that we have sufficient resources to repay or refinance the current portion of our debt and finance lease obligations and to fund our foreseeable liquidity requirements during the next 12 months. As our debt maturities grow in later years, however, we anticipate that we will seek to refinance or otherwise extend our debt maturities. No assurance can be given that we will be able to complete refinancing transactions or otherwise extend our debt maturities. In this regard, it is difficult to predict how political and economic conditions, sovereign debt concerns or any adverse regulatory developments will impact the credit and equity markets we access and our future financial position. From time to time, we may raise additional indebtedness, including additional capital markets indebtedness, to, inter alia, refinance tranches of the CWC Credit Facilities and extend maturities. We will be permitted to incur additional indebtedness in the future to the extent such indebtedness is incurred in compliance with certain covenants included in the CWC Credit Agreement, the Existing Senior Notes Indenture and the Indenture. Based on our covenant compliance calculations as of March 31, 2017, and as adjusted for the Q2 2017 Financing Transactions, the Q3 2017 Financing Transactions, the issuance of the Notes offered hereby and the use of proceeds thereof (including funding of the Proceeds Loan, the RCFs Partial Repayment and the Columbus Refinancing), $707.0 million was available for borrowing under the CWC Credit Facilities. Further, certain agreements governing our indebtedness, including the CWC Credit Agreement and the Existing Senior Notes Indenture allow us, and the Indenture and the Covenant Agreement will allow us, in certain circumstances, to make dividend payments, to make payments on the subordinated loans and to make other distributions under the applicable covenants thereunder limiting restricted payments or to make minority investments or investments in joint ventures. See the discussions under the heading “Description of Other Indebtedness” for further information about CWC’s substantial debt. 33 ----- Because the Issuer has no material operations and no material assets other than its rights under the Proceeds Loan, our high level of debt could have important consequences for you as a holder of the Notes including, but not limited to: - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Proceeds Loan, and in turn making it more difficult for the Issuer to satisfy its obligations under the Notes; - requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flows from operations to payments on its debt, thereby reducing the funds available to it to finance its operations, capital expenditures, working capital, research and development and other general corporate purposes, including maintaining the quality of its network and product performance; - placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to other broadband communications providers in its key markets that have less debt than we do; - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive and economic environment in which we operate; and - impeding our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing, and increasing the cost of any such borrowing. Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations, including the Proceeds Loan, and in turn, the Issuer’s ability to satisfy its obligations under the Notes offered hereby. In addition, certain agreements governing our indebtedness, including the CWC Credit Agreement and the Existing Senior Notes Indenture, contain, and the Indenture and the Covenant Agreement will contain, financial and other restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long term best interests, including, among other things, borrowing additional funds. These restrictions are subject to significant exceptions. Our failure to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default under the CWC Credit Agreement, the Existing Senior Notes Indenture, and/or the Indenture which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debt or have a similar material adverse effect on us. Our ability to service or refinance our debt and to maintain compliance with the leverage covenants (once tested) in our debt documents is dependent primarily on our ability to maintain or increase the cash flow of our operating subsidiaries and to achieve adequate returns on our property and equipment additions and acquisitions. Accordingly, if the cash earned by our operations declines or we encounter other material liquidity requirements, we may be required to seek additional debt or equity financing in order to meet our debt obligations and other liquidity requirements as they come due. In addition, our current debt levels may limit our ability to incur additional debt financing to fund working capital needs, property and equipment additions, investments, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements. We can give no assurance that any additional debt or equity financing will be available on terms that are as favourable as the terms of our existing debt or at all. Additionally, we may incur substantial additional debt in the future, including in connection with any future acquisition.

Also, our ability to increase subscription rates may be constrained by competitive pressures.

Future developments are dependent upon a number of political and economic factors, and as a result, we cannot predict how long challenging conditions will exist or the extent to which the markets in which we operate may deteriorate. Unfavourable economic conditions may impact a significant number of our customers and/or the prices we are able to charge for our products and services, and, as a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract new customers and more likely that customers will downgrade or disconnect their services. Countries may also seek new or increased revenue sources due to fiscal deficits, including increases in regulatory levies, and any such actions may further adversely affect our company. Accordingly, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely effected if the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain or declines further. We are currently unable to predict the extent of any of these potential adverse effects. 36 ----- Additional factors that could influence customer demand include access to credit, unemployment rates, affordability concerns, consumer confidence, capital and credit markets volatility, geopolitical issues and general macroeconomic factors. Certain of these factors drive levels of disposable income, which in turn affect many of our revenue streams. Business solutions customers may delay purchasing decisions, delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services. Our residential customers may similarly elect to use fewer higher margin services, switch from fixed to mobile services resulting in the so-called traffic substitution effect, reduce their consumption of our video services or similarly choose to obtain products and services under lower cost programs offered by our competitors. In addition, adverse economic conditions may lead to a rise in the number of our customers who are not able to pay for our services. Adverse economic conditions can also have an adverse impact on tourism, which in turn can adversely impact our business. In tourist destinations, levels of gross domestic products and levels of foreign investment linked to tourism are closely tied to levels of tourist arrivals and length of stay. In addition to having a direct impact on our revenue, due, for example, to reduction of roaming charges incurred by tourists, these factors will in turn drive disposable income, with the corresponding impact on use of our products and services. Due to the Caribbean’s heavy reliance on tourism, the Caribbean economy has suffered during previous periods of global recession and fluctuations in exchange rates and is likely to be adversely affected if major economies again find themselves in recession or if consumer and/or business confidence in those economies erodes in the face of trends in the global financial markets and economies. Should current economic conditions deteriorate, there may be volatility in exchange rates, increases in interest rates or inflation, liquidity shortfalls and a further adverse effect on our revenue and profits. Recessionary pressures or country-specific issues could, among other things, affect products and services, the level of tourism experienced by some countries and the level of local consumer and business expenditure on telecommunications. In addition, most of our operations are in developing economies, which historically have experienced more volatility in their general economic conditions.

Although we generally seek to match the denomination of our and our subsidiaries’ borrowings with the functional currency of the operations that are supporting the respective borrowings, market conditions or other factors may cause us to enter into borrowing arrangements that are not denominated in the functional currency of the underlying operations (unmatched debt). In these cases, our policy is to provide for an economic hedge against foreign currency exchange rate movements by using derivative instruments to synthetically convert unmatched debt into the applicable underlying currency. As of March 31, 2017, substantially all of our debt was either directly or synthetically matched to the applicable functional currencies of the underlying operations. In addition to the exposure that results from the mismatch of our borrowings and underlying functional currencies, we are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our or our subsidiaries’ respective functional currencies (non-functional currency risk), such as equipment purchases, programming contracts, notes payable and notes receivable (including intercompany amounts). Changes in exchange rates with respect to amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets related to these items will result in unrealized (based upon period-end exchange rates) or realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions. Moreover, to the extent that our revenue, costs and expenses are denominated in currencies other than our respective functional currencies, we will experience fluctuations in our revenue, costs and expenses solely as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Generally, we will consider hedging non-functional currency risks when the risks arise from agreements with third parties that involve the future payment or receipt of cash or other monetary items to the extent that we can reasonably predict the timing and amount of such payments or receipts and the payments or receipts are not otherwise hedged. In this regard, we have entered into cross currency derivative contracts to hedge certain of these risks.

Any increase (decrease) in the value of the U.S. dollar against any foreign currency that is the functional currency of one of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience unrealized foreign currency translation losses (gains) with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies.

In addition, most tax jurisdictions that we operate in have complex and subjective rules regarding the valuation of intercompany services, cross-border payments between affiliated companies and the related effects on income tax and transfer tax. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, any material differences as a result of final determinations of tax audits or tax disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations in the period or periods for which determination is made. We are subject to changing tax laws, treaties and regulations in and between countries in which we operate, or otherwise have a presence. Also, various income tax proposals in the jurisdictions in which we operate could result in changes to the existing laws on which our deferred taxes are calculated. A change in these tax laws, treaties or regulations, or in the interpretation thereof, could result in a materially higher income or non-income tax expense. Any such material changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate. Further changes in the tax laws of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project being undertaken by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”). The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries that includes Chile and the United States, has undertaken studies and is publishing action plans that include recommendations aimed at addressing what they believe are issues within tax systems that may lead to tax avoidance by companies. The OECD has extended inclusion to non-OECD countries under their Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”), bringing together over 100 countries to collaborate on the implementation of the OECD BEPS Package. This framework allows interested countries and jurisdictions to work with the OECD and G20 members on developing standards on BEPS-related issues and reviewing and monitoring the implementation of the whole BEPS Package. Included within this expanded group of countries are several jurisdictions in which we do business. It is possible that additional jurisdictions in which we do business could react to these initiatives or their own concerns by enacting tax legislation that could adversely affect us or our shareholders through increasing our tax liabilities.

952_1,Offerings 2017.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to our Financial Profile,13.1.13,Risks Relating to Tax,"_EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive_ As part of its anti-tax avoidance package the EU Commission published a draft Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive on 28 January 2016, which was formally adopted by the EC Council on 12 July 2016 in Council Directive (EU) 2016/1164 (the “ATAD I”). ATAD I must be implemented by each Member State by 2019, subject to derogations for Member States which have equivalent measures in their domestic law. Ireland has indicated that it will apply for a derogation meaning that the provisions of ATAD I may not implemented in Ireland until 1 January 2024. Amongst the measures contained ATAD I is an interest deductibility limitation rule similar to the recommendation contained in the BEPS Action 4 proposals. The Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive provides that interest costs in excess of the higher of (a) EUR 3,000,000 or (b) 30 per cent of an entity’s earnings before 39 ----- interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation will not be deductible in the year in which they are incurred but would remain available for carry forward. However, the restriction on interest deductibility would only be in respect of the amount by which the borrowing costs exceed “interest revenues and other equivalent taxable revenues from financial assets”. Accordingly, as the Issuer will generally fund interest payments it makes under the Notes from interest payments to which it is entitled under the Proceeds Loan (that is such that the Issuer pays limited or no net interest), the restriction may be of limited relevance to the Issuer even if the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive were implemented as originally published. There is also a carve-out in the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive for financial undertakings, although as currently drafted the Issuer would not be treated as a financial undertaking. The EU Commission is also pursuing other initiatives, such as the introduction of a common corporate tax base, the impact of which, if implemented, is uncertain. _EU Anti-Hybrid Rules_ ATAD I includes measures to implement the recommendations of a number of BEPS action items, including Action 2 on hybrid mismatch arrangements. The hybrid mismatch provisions of ATAD I were limited in scope and only addressed mismatch arrangements arising between EU member states. It was therefore agreed that there should be a subsequent directive to amend ATAD I to address other areas of concern identified, including introducing measures to address hybrid mismatch arrangements with third countries and expand the range of mismatches targeted. An initial draft was published on 25 October 2016, and the text of the Directive was agreed by the Council of the EU on 21 February 2017. Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 amending Directive (EU) 2016/1164 as regards hybrid mismatches with third countries was published on 29 May 2017 and shall enter into force on 27 June 2017 (“ATAD II). ATAD II significantly extends the rules on hybrid mismatches. A hybrid mismatch arrangement is a cross-border arrangement that generally uses a hybrid entity or hybrid instrument and results in a mismatch in the tax treatment of a payment across jurisdictions. ATAD II covers hybrid mismatches arising between (i) associated enterprises, (ii) head offices and permanent establishments and (iii) permanent establishments of the same entity. The forms of hybrid mismatch that are most like to be relevant to an entity such as the Issuer relate to financial instrument mismatches and hybrid entity mismatches. In very broad terms, if a hybrid mismatch results from the use of a financial instrument, the EU member state where the payment is sourced from shall deny the deduction, unless the non-EU member state has already done so. Financial instrument is very broadly defined to include any instrument that gives rise to a financing or equity returned that is taxed under the rules for taxing debt, equity or derivatives under the las of either jurisdiction involved. The rules in relation to financial instrument mismatches could impact financing arrangements such as preferred or convertible equity certificates (PECs or CPECs), but also debt instruments which are “stapled” with an equity instrument or which are treated as debt in one jurisdiction and as equity in another jurisdiction. The new rules also deal with so-called hybrid entities where an entity or arrangements is regarded as a taxable entity in one jurisdiction and whose income or expenditure is treated as income or expenditure of one or more persons in another jurisdiction. These provisions could impact entities which “check the box” for US tax purposes and are treated as transparent. To the extent the Issuer is deemed to be associated with any of the holders of the Notes or it opts to “check the box” for US tax purposes, these rules may impact the Issuer once fully implemented. EU member states must change their domestic laws to implement these rules by December 31, 2019. The rules must apply from 1 January 2020 (with an exception for Reverse Hybrids). _EU Financial Transaction Tax_ On 14 February 2013, the European Commission issued proposals, including a draft Directive (the “Commission’s Proposal”) for a financial transaction tax (“FTT”) to be adopted in certain participating EU member states (including Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (each, other than Estonia, a “Participating Member State”), although Estonia has since stated that 40 ----- it will not participate). If the Commission’s proposal was adopted, the FTT would be a tax primarily on “financial institutions” (which would include the Issuer) in relation to “financial transactions” (which would include the conclusion or modification of derivative contracts and the purchase and sale of financial instruments). Under the Commission’s proposal, the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of the Participating Member States. Generally, it would apply where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a Participating Member State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, “established” in a Participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a Participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the financial transaction is issued in a Participating Member State. The FTT may give rise to tax liabilities for the Issuer with respect to certain transactions (including concluding swap transactions and/or purchases or sales of securities) if it is adopted based on the Commission’s proposal. Any such tax liabilities may reduce amounts available to the Issuer to meet its obligations under the Notes and may result in investors receiving less interest or principal than expected. It should also be noted that the FTT could be payable in relation to relevant transactions by investors in respect of the Notes (including secondary market transactions) if the conditions for a charge to arise are satisfied and the FTT is adopted based on the Commission’s proposal. Primary market transactions referred to in Article 5(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1287/2006 are expected to be exempt. The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between Participating Member States. It may therefore be altered prior to implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional EU member states may decide to participate. Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

In the provision of video services, we face competition from free-to-air (“FTA”) and digital terrestrial television (“DTT”) broadcasters, video provided via satellite platforms, networks using digital subscriber line (“DSL”), very high-speed DSL (“VDSL”) or vectoring technology, Multi-channel Multipoint Distribution System (“MMDS”) operators, FTTx networks, over-the-top (“OTT”) video content aggregators, and, in some countries 41 ----- where parts of our systems are overbuilt. Our operating businesses are facing increasing competition from video services provided by, or over the networks of, other telecommunications operators and service providers. As the availability and speed of broadband internet increases, we also face competition from OTT telephony providers, such as WhatsApp, utilizing our or our competitors’ high-speed internet connections. Some of these content providers offer services without charging a fee, which erodes relationships with customers and leads to a downward pressure on prices and returns for telecommunication services providers. In the provision of telephony and broadband internet services, we are experiencing increasing competition from other telecommunications operators and other service providers in each country in which we operate, as well as mobile providers of voice and data. Many of the other operators offer double-play, triple-play and quadruple-play bundles of services. In many countries, we also compete with other facilities-based operators and wireless providers. Developments in wireless technologies, such as LTE (the next generation of ultra high-speed mobile data) and WiFi, are creating additional competitive challenges. In some of our markets, national and local government agencies may seek to become involved, either directly or indirectly, in the establishment of FTTx networks, DTT systems or other communications systems. We intend to pursue available options to restrict such involvement or to ensure that such involvement is on commercially reasonable terms. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in these pursuits. As a result, we may face competition from entities not requiring a normal commercial return on their investments. In addition, we may face more vigorous competition than would have been the case if there were no such government involvement. We expect the level and intensity of competition to continue to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants as a result of changes in the regulatory framework of the industries in which we operate, advances in technology, the influx of new market entrants and strategic alliances and cooperative relationships among industry participants. Increased competition could result in increased customer churn, reductions of customer acquisition rates for some products and services, and significant price and promotional competition in most of our markets.

Significant additions to our property and equipment are, or in the future may be, required to add customers to our networks and to upgrade or expand our broadband communications networks and upgrade customer premises equipment to enhance our service offerings and improve the customer experience and we are currently investing in such upgrades and network expansions. Additions to our property and equipment, which are currently underway, including in connection with network extensions, require significant capital expenditures for equipment and associated labor costs to build out and/or upgrade our networks as well as for related customer premises equipment. Additionally, significant competition, the introduction of new technologies, the expansion of existing technologies, such as FTTx and advanced DSL technologies, or adverse regulatory developments could cause us to decide to undertake previously unplanned upgrades of our networks and customer premises 42 ----- equipment in the impacted markets. No assurance can be given that any upgrades or extensions of our network will increase penetration rates, increase ARPU or otherwise generate positive returns as anticipated, or that we will have adequate capital available to finance such upgrades or extensions. Additionally, costs related to our network extensions and property and equipment additions could end up being greater than originally anticipated or planned. If this is the case, we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated or we may have to delay or abandon some or all of our development and expansion plans or otherwise forego market opportunities. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, and our ability to incur additional debt will be limited under the Indenture, the Existing Senior Notes Indenture, the CWC Credit Agreement, and other indebtedness we may incur in the future.

Our ability to acquire new businesses may be limited by many factors, including availability of financing, debt covenants, the prevalence of complex ownership structures among potential targets, government regulation and competition from other potential acquirers, including private equity funds. Even if we are successful in acquiring new businesses, the integration of these businesses may present significant costs and challenges associated with realizing economies of scale in interconnection, programming and network operations, eliminating duplicative overheads, integrating personnel, networks, financial systems and operational systems, greater than anticipated expenditures required for compliance with regulatory standards or for investments to improve operating results, and failure to achieve the business plan with respect to any such acquisition. We cannot be assured that we will be successful in acquiring new businesses or realizing the anticipated benefits of any completed acquisition. In addition, we anticipate that any companies we may acquire will be located in the Caribbean or Latin America. Foreign companies may not have disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting that are as thorough or effective as those required by U.S. securities laws.

Our suppliers often conduct business worldwide and their ability to meet our needs is subject to various risks, including political and economic instability, natural calamities, interruptions in transportation systems, terrorism and labor issues. As a result, we may not be able to obtain the equipment, software and services required for our businesses on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms. Any shortfall in our equipment could lead to delays in completing extensions to our networks and in connecting customers to our services and, accordingly, could adversely impact our ability to maintain or increase our RGUs, revenue and cash flows. Also, if demand exceeds the suppliers’ and licensors’ capacity or if they experience financial difficulties, the ability of our businesses to provide some services may be materially adversely affected, which in turn could affect our businesses’ ability to attract and retain customers. To the extent that we have minimum order commitments, we would be adversely affected in the event that we were unable to resell committed products or otherwise decline to accept committed products. Although we actively monitor the creditworthiness of our key third-party suppliers and licensors, the financial failure of a key third-party supplier or licensor could disrupt our operations and have an adverse impact on our revenue and cash flows. We rely upon intellectual property that is owned or licensed by us to use various technologies, conduct our operations and sell our products and services. Legal challenges could be made against our use of our owned or our licensed intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, patents and trade secrets) and we may be required to enter into licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, incur monetary damages or be enjoined from use of the intellectual property rights in question. In addition, the operation, administration, maintenance and repair of our network, including our subsea cable network, requires the coordination and integration of sophisticated and highly specialized hardware and software technologies and equipment located throughout the Caribbean and Latin America and requires operating and capital expenses.

Except for the Flow Sports and Flow 1 services in the Caribbean, we generally do not produce our own channels and we depend on our agreements, relationships and cooperation with public and U.S.-based or private broadcasters to source such content. If we fail to maintain continued access to a diverse array of compelling programming services as well as non-linear content (such as a selection of attractive video-on-demand (“VoD”) content and rights for ancillary services such as digital video recorders (“DVRs”) and catch up services), on satisfactory terms, we may not be able to offer a compelling enough video product to our customers at a price they are willing to pay. Additionally, we are frequently negotiating and renegotiating programming agreements for third party services and live sporting events rights for our services, and our annual costs for programming can vary as a result of these negotiations. Despite our leading position in video in certain Caribbean markets, there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate, renegotiate or renew the terms of some of our programming agreements and/or live sporting events rights on attractive and acceptable terms or at all. We expect that programming costs and live sporting events rights will continue to rise in the future as a result of (i) higher costs associated with the expansion of our video content, including rights associated with ancillary product offerings and for the broadcast of live sporting events, (ii) rate increases and (iii) growth in the number of our enhanced video subscribers. If we are unable to obtain or retain attractively priced competitive content, demand for our television services could decrease, thereby limiting our ability to attract new customers, maintain existing customers and/or migrate customers from legacy programming offerings or lower tier programming to new or higher tier programming, thereby inhibiting our ability to execute our business plans. Furthermore, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage if certain of our competitors obtain exclusive programming rights, particularly with respect to popular sports rights, and if certain entrants in the OTT market, for example Netflix, become increasingly attractive in our markets despite relatively high price points due to their own international exclusive content. 44 ----- In addition, we are party to several legal proceedings arising out of the regular course of our business, including legal proceedings before regulatory and tax authorities, proceedings that programmers may institute against us and proceedings that may arise from acquisitions and other transactions we may consummate. For example, certain copyright agencies, including Copyright Music Organisation of Trinidad and Tobago, have asserted, and may in the future assert, claims against us and our subsidiaries regarding the transmission of any of the musical works within such agencies’ repertoire. Such claims seek injunctive relief as well as monetary damages. We cannot assure you that we will obtain a final favorable decision with regard to any particular proceeding.

As our operations grow in size, scope and complexity, we must continuously improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to offer an increasing number of customers enhanced products, services, features and functionality, while maintaining or improving the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure. Our future success also depends on our ability to adapt our services and infrastructure to meet rapidly evolving consumer trends and demands while continuing to improve the performance, features and reliability of our services in response to competitive service and product offerings. The emergence of alternative platforms such as smartphone and tablet computing devices and the emergence of niche competitors who may be able to optimize products, services or strategies for such platforms have, and will continue to, require new and costly investments in technology. We may not be successful, or may be less successful than our current or new competitors, in developing technology that operates effectively across multiple devices and platforms and that is appealing to consumers, either of which would negatively impact our business and financial performance. New developments in other areas, such as cloud computing and software as a service provider, could also make it easier for competition to enter our markets due to lower up-front technology costs. In addition, we may not be able to maintain our existing systems or replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as customers would like or in a cost-effective manner. Failure in our technology or telecommunications systems or leakage of sensitive customer data could significantly disrupt our operations, which could reduce our customer base and result in lost revenue. Our success depends, in part, on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology and network systems as well as our customer service centers. The hardware supporting a large number of critical systems for our cable network in a particular country or geographic region is housed in a relatively small number of locations. Our systems and equipment (including our routers and set-top boxes) are vulnerable to damage or security breach from a variety of sources, including a cut in our terrestrial network or subsea cable network, telecommunications failures, power loss, malicious human acts, security flaws, and natural disasters. For example, in early October 2016, our fixed-line and mobile networks in the Bahamas suffered extensive damage as a result of Hurricane Matthew, which caused our customers to experience significant outages. Moreover, despite security measures, our servers, systems and equipment are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, worms, phishing attacks and similar disruptive actions. Furthermore, our operating activities could be subject to risks caused by misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information technology systems and networks and those of our thirdparty vendors, including customer, personnel and vendor data. As a result of the increasing awareness concerning the importance of safeguarding personal information, the potential misuse of such information, and legislation that has been adopted or is being considered across all of our markets regarding the protection, privacy and security of personal information, information-related risks are increasing, particularly for businesses like ours that handle a large amount of personal customer data. Failure to comply with these data protection laws may result in, among other consequences, fines. Our disaster recovery, security and service continuity protection measures include back-up power systems, resilient ring network systems, procuring capacity in competing networks to further strengthen our reliability 45 ----- profile and network monitoring. We also are party to the Atlantic Cable Maintenance and Repair Agreement, which provides us with certain dedicated repair vessels and timely call out services with respect to our subsea cables through to the present. We cannot assure you, however, that these precautions will be sufficient to prevent loss of data or prolonged network downtime or that we will be able to renegotiate arrangements with the Atlantic Cable Maintenance and Repair Agreement on successful terms. Despite the precautions we have taken, unanticipated problems affecting our systems could cause failures in our information technology systems or disruption in the transmission of signals over our networks or similar problems. Any disruptive situation that causes loss, misappropriation, misuse or leakage of data could damage our reputation and the credibility of our operations. Further, sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to provide service to our customers or otherwise meet our business obligations in a timely manner could adversely affect our reputation and result in a loss of customers and in an adverse impact on revenue.",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

Therefore we are subject to the following inherent risks: - fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; - difficulties in staffing and managing operations consistently through our several operating areas; - potentially adverse tax consequences; - export and import restrictions, custom duties, tariffs and other trade barriers; - burdensome tax, customs, duties or regulatory assessments based on new or differing interpretations of law or regulations, including increases in taxes and governmental fees. See—Risks Relating to our _Financial Profile—We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities;_ - economic and political instability; - changes in foreign and domestic laws and policies that govern operations of foreign-based companies. - interruptions to essential energy inputs; - direct and indirect price controls; - cancellation of contract rights and licenses; - delays or denial of governmental approvals; - a lack of reliable security technologies; - privacy concerns; and - uncertainty regarding intellectual property rights and other legal issues. Operational risks that we may experience in certain countries include uncertain and rapidly changing political, regulatory and economic conditions, including the possibility of disruptions of services or loss of property or equipment that are critical to overseas businesses as a result of vandalism affecting cable and fiber-optic assets, expropriation, nationalization, war, insurrection, terrorism or general social or political unrest. In certain countries and territories in which we operate, political, security and economic changes may result in political and regulatory uncertainty and civil unrest. Governments may expropriate or nationalize assets or increase their participation in the economy generally and in telecommunications operations in particular. In addition, certain countries and territories in which we operate, or in which we may operate in the future, face significant challenges relating to the lack, or poor condition, of physical infrastructure, including transportation, electricity generation and transmission. Such countries and territories may also be subject to a higher risk of inflationary pressures, which could increase our operating costs and decrease consumer demand and spending power. Each of these factors could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 46 ----- Moreover, in many foreign countries, particularly in certain developing economies, it is not uncommon to encounter business practices that are prohibited by certain regulations, such as laws relating to anti-corruption, including, for example, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws. Following Liberty Global’s acquisition of our Group, we have undertaken a comprehensive review of our business practices and stepped up our compliance efforts, including by training our staff and implementing new policies and procedures to monitor and address compliance with respect to these laws. However, there can be no assurance that our Group, employees, contractors and agents, sub-contractors and third parties that we engage to interact with government officials on our behalf, have not taken actions or made payments prior to Liberty’s acquisition of our Group in violation of applicable anti-corruption laws. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that our Group, employees, contractors and agents, sub-contractors and third parties that we engage to interact with government officials on our behalf, will not in future take actions in violation of these policies and procedures or applicable anticorruption laws.

Mobile, broadband internet, video distribution and telephony businesses are subject to licensing or registration eligibility rules and regulations, which vary by country. Our ability to provide telecommunications services depends on applicable law, telecommunications regulations and the terms of the licenses and concessions we are granted under such laws and regulations. In particular, we are reliant on access with mutually beneficial terms to spectrum for both existing and next generation telecommunication services, entrance into interconnection agreements with other telecommunications companies and are subject to a range of decisions by regulators, including in respect of pricing, for example, for termination rates. The provision of electronic communications networks and services requires our licensing from, or registration with, the appropriate regulatory authorities. It is possible that countries in which we operate may adopt laws and regulations regarding electronic commerce, which could dampen the growth of the internet services being offered and developed by these businesses. In a number of countries, our ability to increase the prices we charge for our cable television service or make changes to the programming packages we offer is limited by regulation or conditions imposed by competition authorities, or is subject to review by regulatory authorities or termination rights of customers. In addition, regulatory authorities may grant new licenses to third parties and, in any event, in most of our markets new entry is possible without a license, although there may be registration eligibility rules and regulations, resulting in greater competition in territories where our businesses may already be active. More significantly, regulatory authorities may require us to grant third parties access to our bandwidth, frequency capacity, facilities, infrastructure or services to distribute their own services or resell our services to end customers. Consequently, our businesses must adapt their ownership and organizational structure as well as their pricing and service offerings to satisfy the rules and regulations to which they are subject. A failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations could result in penalties, restrictions on our business or loss of required licenses or other adverse conditions. We may continue to operate in jurisdictions where governments fail to grant or renew licenses for our operations, which could result in penalties, fines or restrictions that could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition. Adverse changes in rules and regulations could: - impair our ability to use our bandwidth in ways that would generate maximum revenue and cash flow; - create a shortage of capacity on our networks, which could limit the types and variety of services we seek to provide our customers; - impact our ability to access spectrum for our mobile services; - strengthen our competitors by granting them access and lowering their costs to enter into our markets; and - otherwise have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations. The regulatory authorities in several countries in which we do business have considered from time to time what access rights, if any, should be afforded to third parties for use of existing cable television networks and have imposed access obligations in certain countries. For more information, see “Regulatory Matters”. 47 ----- Regulations may be especially strict in the markets of those countries in which we are considered to hold a significant market position. We have been, in the past, and may be, in the future, subject to allegations and complaints by our competitors and other third parties regarding our competitive behaviour as a significant market operator. Furthermore, the governments in the countries and territories in which we operate differ widely with respect to political structure, constitution, economic philosophy, stability and level of regulation. Many of our operations depend on governmental approval and regulatory decisions, and we provide services to governmental organizations in certain markets (and in certain cases, governmental organizations are our biggest customers). Moreover, in several of our key markets, including Panama and the Bahamas, governments are our partners and co-owners. Consequently, we may not be able to fully utilize our contractual or legal rights or all options that may otherwise be available, where to do so might conflict with broader regulatory or governmental considerations.

This is particularly the case with respect to any proposed business combinations, which will often require clearance from national competition authorities. When we acquire additional communications companies, these acquisitions may require the approval of governmental authorities, which can block, impose conditions on, or delay an acquisition, thus hampering our opportunities for growth. In the event conditions are imposed and we fail to meet them in a timely manner, the governmental authority may impose fines and, if in connection with an acquisition transaction, may require restorative measures, such as mandatory disposition of assets or divestiture of operations. Most recently, the acquisition of CWC by Liberty Global in May 2016 triggered regulatory approval requirements in certain jurisdictions in which we operate. The regulatory authorities in certain of these jurisdictions, including the Bahamas, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and the Seychelles, have not completed their review of this acquisition or granted their approval.

In addition, we are subject to review by competition or national regulatory authorities in certain countries concerning whether we exhibit significant market power. A finding of significant market power could result in us becoming subject to access and pricing obligations and other requirements that could provide a more favorable operating environment for existing and potential competitors. Government regulation or administrative policies may change unexpectedly and negatively affect our interests. For example, the Eastern Caribbean Telecommunications Authority (“ECTEL”), the regulatory body for telecommunications in five Eastern Caribbean States (Commonwealth of Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts & Nevis, St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines), has adopted an Electronic Communications Bill that may have a material adverse impact on our operations in the ECTEL member states.

In addition, several markets in which we operate have imposed, or are considering imposing, regulation designed to further encourage competition, including introducing requirements related to unbundling, network access to 48 ----- third parties, and local number portability (“LNP”). LNP has been implemented in Panama, the Cayman Islands and Jamaica and is currently being contemplated or implemented in other jurisdictions, including Barbados, the Bahamas and Trinidad and Tobago. These changes may impair our competitive position in those markets. For various reasons, governments may seek to increase the regulation of the use of the internet, particularly with respect to user privacy and data protection, content, pricing, copyrights, consumer protection, distributions and characteristics and quality of products and services. Application of existing laws, including those addressing property ownership and personal privacy in the context of rapidly evolving technological developments remains uncertain and in flux. New interpretations of such laws could have an adverse effect on our business. Governments may also seek to regulate the content of communications in all of our revenue streams, which could reduce the attractiveness of our services. Governments may also change their attitude towards foreign investment or extract extra concessions from businesses. Accordingly, our operations may be constrained by the relevant political environment and may be adversely affected by such constraints, as well as by changes to the political structure or government in any of the markets in which we operate. Future changes to regulation or changes in political administrations or a significant deterioration in our relationship with relevant regulators in the jurisdictions in which we operate, as well as failure to acquire and retain the necessary consents and approvals or in any other way comply with regulatory requirements, or excessive costs of complying with new or more onerous regulations and restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

Some of these licenses may also include clauses that allow the grantor to terminate or revoke or alter them in the event of a default or other failure by us to comply with applicable conditions of the license or to promote the public interest. Further, a number of our operating licenses include change of control clauses, which may be triggered by the sale of a business to which those clauses relate, or certain types of corporate restructurings. Some of these change of control clauses may restrict our strategic options, including the ability to complete any potential disposal of individual businesses, a combination of businesses or the entire Group unless a consent or waiver is obtained, and, if triggered, may lead to some licenses being terminated. Failure to hold or to continue to hold or obtain the necessary licenses, concessions and other operating agreements required to operate our businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, in almost all cases, our licenses are not exclusive. As a result, our competitors have similar licenses and have and may continue to build systems and provide services in areas in which we hold licenses.

Accordingly, insolvency proceedings with respect to the Initial Proceeds Loan Borrower would be likely to proceed under, and be governed by, Cayman Islands insolvency law. Further, Initial Proceeds Loan Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, Barbados or Delaware. Insolvency proceedings with respect to any of those entities would be likely to proceed under, and be governed by English, Barbados, or U.S. insolvency law respectively. In addition, the New Proceeds Loan Borrower has not yet been formed and may be incorporated in any Approved Jurisdiction. Although laws differ among jurisdictions, in general, applicable insolvency laws in such jurisdictions and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts may limit the enforceability of judgments against the Initial Proceeds Loan Obligors and (following the Group Refinancing Effective Date, if the Group Refinancing Transactions take place) the New Proceeds Loan Obligors. The following discussion of insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdictions’ insolvency statutes. In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Proceeds Loan Guarantors or appointed insolvency administrator may challenge the Proceeds Loan Guarantees, and intercompany obligations generally, as fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to: - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Proceeds Loan Guarantor’s obligations under its Proceeds Loan Guarantee; - direct that holders of the Issuer return any amounts paid under a Proceeds Loan Guarantee to the relevant Proceeds Loan Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Proceeds Loan Guarantor’s creditors; and - take other action that is detrimental to the Issuer (and therefore, indirectly detrimental to the holders of the Notes). We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Proceeds Loan Guarantor was “insolvent” as of the date the guarantees were issued or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Proceeds Loan Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Proceeds Loan Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Proceeds Loan Guarantee was issued, that payments to holders of the Issuer constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds. Furthermore, under English and other applicable insolvency law, some of our subsidiaries’ debts may be entitled to priority, including amounts owed in respect of various U.K. social security contributions, amounts owed in respect of occupational pension schemes, certain amounts owed to employees and liquidation expenses.",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

Under English insolvency law, the liquidator or administrator of a company may apply to the court to set aside a 56 ----- transaction entered into by that company within up to two years prior to it entering into relevant insolvency proceedings, if the company was unable to pay its debts, as defined in Section 123 of the U.K. Insolvency Act 1986, at the time of, or becomes unable to pay its debts as a consequence of, that transaction. For example, a transaction might be subject to a challenge if a company received no consideration or consideration of significantly less value than the benefit given by that company. A court generally will not intervene in these circumstances, however, if a company entered into the transaction in good faith for the purpose of carrying on its business and if at the time it did so there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit the company. The Issuer cannot assure holders of the Notes that in the event of insolvency the guarantees by the entities incorporated in England and Wales would not be challenged by a liquidator or administrator or that a court would support our analysis that the guarantees have been entered into in good faith for the purposes described above. If a court voided any Proceeds Loan Guarantee, or any payment thereunder, as a result of a transaction at an undervalue or a preference, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you would cease to have any claim against the applicable Proceeds Loan Guarantor under its Proceeds Loan Guarantee. In the event that any Proceeds Loan Guarantee is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent the agreed limitation of the Proceeds Loan Guarantee obligations apply, the Proceeds Loan would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Proceeds Loan Guarantor, and if we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Proceeds Loan or any Proceeds Loan Guarantee is found to be a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

If the Issuer can no longer maintain the listing on the International Stock Exchange or it becomes unduly burdensome to make or maintain such listing (for the avoidance of doubt, preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP or any other accounting standard other than IFRS and any other standard pursuant to which the Issuer (or any successor reporting entity for the Notes in accordance with the reporting covenant in the Indenture), the Issuer may cease to make or maintain such listing on the International Stock Exchange, provided that the Issuer will use all reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the Notes on another stock exchange (which may be a stock exchange that is not regulated by the European Union), although there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to do so. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Issuer may cease to make or maintain a listing (whether on the International Stock Exchange or on another recognized listing exchange for high yield issuers) if such listing is not required for the Issuer to benefit from an exemption on withholding tax on interest payments on the Notes or to otherwise prevent tax from being withheld from interest payments on the Notes. The Notes will constitute a new issue of securities with no established trading market. If a trading market does not develop or is not maintained, holders of the Notes may experience difficulty in reselling the Notes or may be unable to sell them at all. Accordingly, the Issuer cannot assure holders that an active trading market for the Notes will develop or, if a market develops, as to the liquidity of the market. The liquidity of any market for the Notes will depend on the number of holders of the Notes, the interest of securities dealers in making a market in the Notes and other factors. Accordingly, the Issuer cannot assure you as to the development or liquidity of any market for the Notes. If an active trading market does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the Notes may be adversely affected. If the Notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial issue price depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, general economic conditions, the Issuer’s performance and business prospects and certain other factors. Factors including the following may have a significant effect on the market price of the Notes: - actual or anticipated fluctuations in operating results of the Issuer, including its ability to generate cash flow from operations; - perceived business prospects of the Issuer; 57 ----- - ability or perceived ability of the Issuer to access capital markets and other sources of financing in the future; - general economic conditions, including prevailing interest rates; and - the market for similar securities.",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

If a change of control were to occur, the Issuer cannot assure you that the Proceeds Loan Obligors will have sufficient funds to fund a prepayment of the Proceeds Loan such that the Issuer would have sufficient funds available at such time to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes, or that other then-existing contractual obligations of the Issuer would allow the Issuer to make such required repurchases. A change of control may also result in an event of default under, or an acceleration of, other indebtedness or trigger a similar obligation to offer to repurchase loans or notes thereunder. The mandatory prepayment of the Proceeds Loan or the repurchase of the Notes, as applicable, pursuant to such an offer, could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a change of control may be limited by the Issuer’s then-existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required prepayment of the Proceeds Loan or the repurchases of the Notes, as applicable. If an event constituting a change of control (as defined in the Indenture) occurs at a time when the Proceeds Loan Obligors are prohibited from prepaying the Proceeds Loan or the Issuer is prohibited from repurchasing Notes, the Proceeds Loan Obligors or the Issuer may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the prepayment of the Proceeds Loan or the repurchase of Notes, as applicable, or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Proceeds Loan Obligors or the Issuer do not obtain such a consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any tendered Notes. In addition, the Issuer expects that it would require third party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. Neither the Issuer nor we can assure you that it will be able to obtain such external financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the relevant series of Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the relevant series of Notes. See “—Change of Control” in the applicable Description of the Notes. The change of control provisions contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction involving the Issuer or the Proceeds Loan Obligors that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “change of control” as defined in the Indenture. Except as described under “—Change of Control” in the applicable Description of the Notes, the Indenture do not contain provisions that require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction involving the relevant Issuer or the Proceeds Loan Obligors. The definition of “change of control” contained in the Indenture includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Proceeds Loan Obligors and their restricted subsidiaries taken as whole to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all”, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Proceeds Loan Obligors and their restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes. 58 -----",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

In addition, the Proceeds Loan Agreement will contain the advance, unconditional and irrevocable consent of the Issuer, as lender under the Proceeds Loan, to the Intercreditor Amendment and Restatement, and the Issuer will not be entitled to vote on any future request for consent to the Intercreditor Amendment and Restatement, or with respect to the implementation thereof. Pursuant to the Proceeds Loan Agreement, the Issuer (or its representative) will agree to execute or accede to the New Intercreditor Agreement. In particular, holders of the Notes should note that from the New Intercreditor Effective Date until the Group Refinancing Effective Date, pursuant to the New Intercreditor Agreement, the Proceeds Loan and the Initial Proceeds Loan Guarantees will be converted from senior into senior subordinated claims, by becoming, among other things: - contractually subordinated to any relevant senior secured Indebtedness (including the CWC Credit Facilities); - subject to payment blockage upon a senior default; - subject to standstills on enforcement; and - subject to release under certain circumstances.

DTC (or its nominee) will be the holder of the Notes. After payment to the respective depositary, the Issuer will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest, you must rely on the procedures of DTC and if you are not a participant in DTC, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights of a holder of the Notes under the Indenture. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.” Unlike holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon solicitations for consents or requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from the DTC. The Issuer cannot assure you that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any requested actions on a timely basis. The lack of physical certificates could also: - result in payment delays on your certificates because the Trustee will be sending distributions on the certificates to the DTC instead of directly to you; - make it difficult for you to pledge your certificates if physical certificates are required by the party demanding the pledge; and - hinder your ability to resell your certificates because some investors may be unwilling to buy certificates that are not in physical form. Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until definitive registered notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be restricted to acting through the DTC.

In the Bahamas, where we previously were the only provider of mobile services, competition has increased significantly due to the commercial launch of mobile services by a competitor during the quarter ended December 31, 2016. In addition, fixed-line competition has increased in Trinidad and Tobago. In certain of our markets, we are also experiencing increased regulatory intervention that would, if implemented, facilitate increased competition. For additional information regarding the competition we face, see Description of Our Business—Regulatory Matters and—Competition included in the December 31, 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements. This significant competition, together with macroeconomic factors, has adversely impacted our revenue, RGUs and/or ARPU, particularly in Barbados, the Bahamas and Trinidad and Tobago. For additional information regarding the revenue impact of changes in RGUs and ARPU, see Results of _Operations below._ In addition, our operations are subject to macroeconomic and political risks that are outside of our control. For example, high levels of sovereign debt in the U.S. and certain European countries, combined with weak growth and high unemployment, could potentially lead to fiscal reforms (including austerity measures), tax increases, sovereign debt restructurings, currency instability, increased counterparty credit risk, high levels of volatility and disruptions in the credit and equity markets, as well as other outcomes that might adversely impact our company. In general, our ability to increase or maintain the fees we receive for our services is limited by competitive and, to a lesser degree, regulatory factors. The competition we face in our markets, as well as any decline in the 70 ----- economic environment, could adversely impact our ability to increase or maintain our revenue, RGUs, Adjusted Segment EBITDA or liquidity. We currently are unable to predict the extent of any of these potential adverse effects.

As we use the term, “Adjusted Segment EBITDA” is defined as EBITDA before share-based compensation, provisions and provision releases related to significant litigation and other operating items. Other operating items include (i) gains and losses on the disposition of long-lived assets, (ii) third-party costs directly associated with successful and unsuccessful acquisitions and dispositions, including legal, advisory and due diligence fees, as applicable, (iii) other acquisition-related items, such as gains and losses on the settlement of contingent consideration, (iv) restructuring provisions or provision releases and (v) share of results of joint ventures and associates.",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

We are exposed to unfavorable and potentially volatile fluctuations of the U.S. dollar (our presentation currency) against the currencies of our operating subsidiaries when their respective financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in foreign currency translation as a separate component of equity. Any increase (decrease) in the value of the U.S. dollar against any foreign currency that is the functional currency of one of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience unrealized foreign currency translation losses (gains) with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies. Accordingly, we may experience a negative impact on our comprehensive earnings (loss) and equity with respect to our holdings solely as a result of foreign currency translation. While approximately 72% of our revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2017 is in U.S. dollars or pegged to the U.S. dollar, we do have exposure to certain foreign currency risk.

For further information regarding the Columbus Acquisition, see note 5 to the December 31, 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact our reported operating results as certain of our subsidiaries have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Our primary exposure to FX risk during the three months ended March 31, 2017 was to the Jamaican dollar, Trinidad and Tobago dollar and Colombian peso. In addition, our reported operating results are impacted by changes in the exchange rates for other local currencies in the Caribbean and Latin America. The portions of the changes in the various components of our results of operations that are attributable to changes in FX are highlighted under Results of Operations below. Most of our revenue is subject to VAT or similar revenue-based taxes. Any increases in these taxes could have an adverse impact on our ability to maintain or increase our revenue to the extent that we are unable to pass such tax increases on to our customers. In the case of revenue-based taxes for which we are the ultimate taxpayer, we will also experience increases in our operating expenses and corresponding declines in our Adjusted Segment EBITDA and Adjusted Segment EBITDA margin to the extent of any such tax increases. We pay interconnection fees to other telephony providers when calls or text messages from our subscribers terminate on another network, and we receive similar fees from such providers when calls or text messages from their customers terminate on our networks or networks that we access through other arrangements. The amounts that we charge and incur with respect to fixed-line telephony and mobile interconnection fees are subject to 71 ----- regulatory oversight. To the extent that regulatory authorities introduce fixed-line or mobile termination rate changes, we would experience prospective changes in our interconnect revenue and costs. The ultimate impact of any such changes in termination rates on our Adjusted Segment EBITDA would be dependent on the call or text messaging patterns that are subject to the changed termination rates.",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

Consistent with the presentation of our revenue categories in note 18 to the March 31, 2017 Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we use the term “subscription revenue” in the following discussion to refer to amounts received from subscribers for ongoing services, excluding installation fees and late fees. In the below table for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, mobile subscription revenue excludes the related interconnect revenue. Variances in the subscription revenue that we receive from our customers are a function of (i) changes in the number of RGUs or mobile subscribers outstanding during the period and (ii) changes in ARPU. Changes in ARPU can be attributable to (a) price increases, (b) changes in bundling or promotional discounts, (c) changes in the tier of services selected, (d) variances in subscriber usage patterns and (e) the overall mix of cable and mobile products within a segment during the period.

(b) Mobile subscription revenue excludes mobile interconnect revenue of $36.0 million and $37.9 million during the nine months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Mobile interconnect revenue and mobile handset sales are included in other revenue. (c) Other revenue includes, among other items, managed services, wholesale, interconnect and mobile handset sales revenue. _Total revenue. Our consolidated revenue decreased $46.6 million during the nine months ended December 31,_ 2016, as compared to the corresponding period in 2015. Excluding the effects of FX, our consolidated revenue decreased $21.9 million or 1.2%. _Subscription revenue.

This decrease is attributable to (i) a decrease from fixed-line telephony services of $8.8 million or 8.4%, attributable to the net impact of (a) lower ARPU from fixed-line telephony services and (b) an increase in the average number of fixed-line telephony RGUs, (ii) a decrease from video services of $5.7 million or 4.2%, attributable to (a) lower ARPU from video services and (b) a decrease in the average number of video RGUs and (iii) an increase from broadband internet services of $1.4 million or 0.9%, attributable to the net effect of (a) an increase in the average number of broadband internet RGUs and (b) lower ARPU from broadband internet services. 77 ----- Excluding the effects of FX, our consolidated mobile subscription revenue decreased $3.9 million or 0.7% during the nine months ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the corresponding period in 2015. This decrease is primarily due to the net effect of (i) a decline in ARPU, primarily in the Bahamas, and (ii) an increase in the average number of mobile customers. _Other revenue. Excluding the effects of FX, our consolidated other revenue decreased $4.9 million or 0.6%_ during the nine months ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the corresponding period in 2015. This decrease is largely attributable to lower equipment subsidies. In addition, our other revenue was adversely impacted by the fact that, effective April 1, 2016, we began recognizing revenue on a cash, rather than accrual, basis with respect to two of our more significant B2B customers due primarily to unfavorable collection experience and unfavorable macroeconomic factors. These decreases were partially offset by increases in managed services revenue from information technology solutions and complex connectivity.

If, among other factors, (i) our enterprise value or Liberty Global’s equity values were to decline significantly or (ii) the adverse impacts of economic, competitive, regulatory or other factors were to cause our results of operations or cash flows to be worse than anticipated, we could conclude in future periods that impairment charges are required in order to reduce the carrying values of our goodwill and, to a lesser extent, other longlived assets.

(c) Excluding the effects of the Columbus Acquisition and FX, our broadband internet subscription revenue increased $4.1 million or 2.4%, primarily attributable to (i) higher ARPU, mainly in Jamaica and the Cayman Islands, and (ii) an increase in the average number of broadband subscribers. (d) Excluding the effects of the Columbus Acquisition and FX, our fixed-line telephony subscription revenue decreased $18.8 million or 5.2%, primarily attributable to lower ARPU due to a change in RGU mix from fixed-line telephony to mobile and broadband based services, such as voice-over-internet-protocol. (e) Excluding the effects of the Columbus Acquisition and FX, our mobile subscription revenue increased $10.5 million or 1.1%, primarily due to an increase in the average number of subscribers mainly due to the positive impact of (i) regulatory rate changes, (ii) the introduction of long-term evolution mobile services and (iii) various other network upgrades. These positive impacts were partially offset by the negative impact of rate reductions in the Bahamas in anticipation of the commercial launch of mobile services by a competitor, which occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2016. (f) Other revenue primarily includes, among other items, managed services and wholesale sales revenue. Excluding the effects of the Columbus Acquisition and FX, the increase in other revenue is primarily attributable to the acquisition of Grupo Sonitel.

Our significant operating subsidiaries are included within one of our “borrowing groups.” These borrowing groups include the respective restricted parent and subsidiary entities within CWC and Columbus and entities holding amounts borrowed by CW Panama, BTC and CW Jamaica, each a subsidiary of CWC (collectively, the “CWC Regional Facilities”). Our borrowing groups accounted for all of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2017. The terms of the instruments governing the indebtedness of these borrowing groups restrict our ability to access the liquidity of these subsidiaries. In addition, our ability to access the liquidity of these and other subsidiaries may be limited by tax and legal considerations, the presence of noncontrolling interests, foreign currency exchange restrictions and other factors. As of March 31, 2017, we had $288.4 million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents, of which $74.7 million was held by Columbus. _Liquidity of CWC_ Our sources of liquidity at the parent level include dividend income received on our investments and, subject to certain tax and legal considerations, our unrestricted subsidiaries’ cash and cash equivalents and investments. 84 ----- The ongoing cash needs of CWC include (i) corporate general and administrative expenses and (ii) required funding of employee benefit plans. From time to time, CWC may also require cash in connection with (a) the funding of loans or distributions to LGE Coral Holdco Limited (“LGE Coral Holdco”) (and ultimately to Liberty Global or other Liberty Global subsidiaries), (b) the satisfaction of contingent liabilities or (c) acquisitions and other investment opportunities. No assurance can be given that funding from Liberty Global or other Liberty Global subsidiaries, our subsidiaries or external sources would be available on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, the amount of cash we receive from our subsidiaries to satisfy U.S. dollar-denominated liquidity requirements is impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates. In this regard, the strengthening (weakening) of the U.S. dollar against these currencies will result in decreases (increases) in the U.S. dollars received from the applicable subsidiaries to fund U.S. dollar-denominated liquidity requirements. _Liquidity of our subsidiaries_ In addition to cash and cash equivalents, the primary sources of liquidity of our subsidiaries are cash provided by operations, in the case of the Issuer, any borrowing availability under the CWC Revolving Credit Facility and borrowings available under the CWC Regional Facilities. As of March 31, 2017, we had aggregate borrowing capacity of $612.5 million available under the CWC Revolving Credit Facility. For information regarding limitations on the borrowing availability of the CWC Revolving Credit Facility, see note 8 to the March 31, 2017 Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The liquidity of our subsidiaries is generally used to fund capital expenditures, debt service requirements and other liquidity requirements that may arise from time to time. For additional information regarding our consolidated cash flows, see the discussion under Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows below. Our subsidiaries may also require funding in connection with (i) the repayment of outstanding debt, (ii) acquisitions and other investment opportunities or (iii) distributions or loans to CWC (and ultimately to Liberty Global or other Liberty Global subsidiaries). No assurance can be given that any external funding would be available to our subsidiaries on favorable terms, or at all.",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

Our debt and finance lease obligations are all held by our subsidiaries. Our ability to service or refinance our debt and to maintain compliance with our leverage covenants is dependent primarily on our ability to maintain or increase our Covenant EBITDA and to achieve adequate returns on our property, equipment and intangible asset additions and acquisitions. Our ability to maintain or increase cash from our operations will depend on our future operating performance, which is in turn dependent, to some extent, on general economic, financial, competitive, market, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, our ability to obtain additional debt financing is limited by the leverage covenants contained in our and our subsidiaries’ various debt instruments. In this regard, if our Covenant EBITDA were to decline, we could be required to repay or limit our borrowings under the CWC Revolving Credit Facility in order to maintain compliance with applicable covenants. No assurance can be given that we would have sufficient sources of liquidity, or that any external funding would be available on favorable terms, or at all, to fund any such required repayment. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, the cash provided from the operations of our subsidiaries and any available borrowings under the CWC Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our currently anticipated working capital needs, capital expenditures and debt service requirements during the next 12 months, although no assurance can be given that this will be the case. However, as our maturing debt grows in later years, we anticipate that we will seek to refinance or otherwise extend our debt maturities. No assurance can be given that we will be able to complete these refinancing transactions or otherwise extend our debt maturities. In this regard, it is not possible to predict how political and economic conditions, sovereign debt concerns or any 85 ----- adverse regulatory developments could impact the credit markets we access and, accordingly, our future liquidity and financial position. However, (i) the financial failure of any of our counterparties could (a) reduce amounts available under committed credit facilities and (b) adversely impact our ability to access cash deposited with any failed financial institution and (ii) tightening of the credit markets could adversely impact our ability to access debt financing on favorable terms, or at all.

On June 26, 2017, the CWSF Trustee elected to drawdown the full £100.0 million ($129.6 million at the applicable rate) available under the letters of credit, which amount was contributed to the CWSF on July 3, 2017. 89 ----- Based on the triennial actuarial valuation of the CWSF as of March 31, 2016 that was completed in July 2017, no contributions to fund the CWSF through April 2019 are currently anticipated.",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

952_1,Offerings 2017.md,212,BUSINESS,212.1,Overview,212.1.1,,"We are a leading telecommunications company with operations predominantly in the Caribbean and Latin America. The communications and entertainment services that we deliver to our residential and business customers over our networks include mobile services, broadband internet, video and telephony. In most of our operating footprint, we offer a “triple play” of bundled services that includes digital video, internet and telephony in one subscription. Where we deem advantageous, we are enhancing our “triple play” offer by offering mobile services for a “quad play,” or fixed-mobile convergence service. Available service offerings depend on the bandwidth capacity of a particular system and whether it has been upgraded for two-way communications. We provide residential and B2B services in 18 countries in the Caribbean and parts of Latin America and the Seychelles, while we provide B2B only services in certain other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean and wholesale services over our subsea and terrestrial networks in that region. Our business products and services include enterprise-grade connectivity, data center, hosting and managed solutions, as well as IT solutions with customers ranging from small and medium enterprises to international companies and government agencies. We also own extensive sub-sea and terrestrial fiber optic cable networks that connect over 40 countries and territories throughout the Caribbean and parts of Latin America. Our networks include long-haul terrestrial backbone and metro fiber networks that provide access to major commercial areas, wireless carrier cell sites and customers in key markets throughout our operating footprint. We believe we operate the largest fixed network capable of delivering video services in each of Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and a number of other Caribbean markets, when measured in terms of video subscribers. We believe we also operate the largest telephony network, when measured in terms of fixed-line telephony subscribers, in each of Panama, Jamaica, Barbados, the Bahamas and in almost all of the other Caribbean countries where we provide retail services. We have expanded our footprint through new build projects and strategic acquisitions. Our new build projects consist of network programs pursuant to which we connect additional homes and businesses to our broadband communications network. We are also upgrading networks to make them two-way compatible. During 2016, we continued improvements to our network, building or upgrading approximately 200,000 homes across our footprint, namely in Panama. We have made strategic acquisitions that deliver the scale that allows us to innovate and deliver quality services, content and products to our customers, namely the acquisition of Columbus on March 31, 2015. Additionally, on May 16, 2016, we were acquired by Liberty Global and attributed to Liberty Global’s LiLAC Group. “Cable & Wireless” is a well-recognized and respected brand that has been in use for more than 80 years. CWC’s leading brands include Flow in the Caribbean, BTC in the Bahamas, Más Móvil in Panama, C&W Business and C&W Networks. Our operations are provided through various consolidated subsidiaries, including the following subsidiaries where we own less than 100%: Cable & Wireless Panama, SA (we own 49.0% of this entity which owns most of our operations in Panama); the Bahamas Telecommunications Company Limited (we own 49.0% of this entity which owns all of our operations in the Bahamas); Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited (we own 82.0% of this entity which owns the majority of our operations in Jamaica); and Cable & Wireless Barbados Limited (we own 81.1% of this entity which owns the majority of our operations in Barbados). 91 ----- The following tables present certain operating data as of March 31, 2017, with respect to our networks.

Our Homes Passed counts are based on census data that can change based on either revisions to the data or from new census results. We exclude DTH homes from Homes Passed. (2) Two-way Homes Passed are Homes Passed by those sections of our networks that are technologically capable of providing two-way services, including video, internet and telephony services. (3) Customer Relationships are the number of customers who receive at least one of our video, internet or telephony services that we count as RGUs (revenue generating units), without regard to which or to how many services they subscribe. Customer Relationships generally are counted on a unique premises basis. Accordingly, if an individual receives our services in two premises (e.g., a primary home and a vacation home), that individual generally will count as two Customer Relationships. We exclude mobile-only customers from Customer Relationships. (4) RGU is separately a Basic Video Subscriber, Enhanced Video Subscriber, DTH Subscriber, Internet Subscriber or Telephony Subscriber (each as defined and described below). A home, residential multiple dwelling unit, or commercial unit may contain one or more RGUs. For example, if a residential customer in one of our markets subscribed to our enhanced video service, fixed-line telephony service and broadband internet service, the customer would constitute three RGUs. Total RGUs is the sum of Basic Video, Enhanced Video, DTH, Internet and Telephony Subscribers. RGUs generally are counted on a unique premises basis such that a given premises does not count as more than one RGU for any given service. On the other hand, if an individual receives one of our services in two premises (e.g., a primary home and a vacation home), that individual will count as two RGUs for that service. Each bundled cable, internet or telephony service is counted as a separate RGU regardless of the nature of any bundling discount or promotion. Non-paying subscribers are counted as subscribers during their free promotional service period. Some of these subscribers may choose to disconnect after their free service period. Services offered without charge on a long-term basis (e.g., VIP subscribers, free service to employees) generally are not counted as RGUs. RGUs in the table do not include subscriptions to mobile services: our RGU counts exclude our separately reported postpaid and prepaid mobile subscribers. (5) Basic Video Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video service over our broadband network either via an analog video signal or via a digital video signal without subscribing to any recurring monthly service that requires the use of encryption-enabling technology. Encryption-enabling technology includes smart cards, or other integrated or virtual technologies that we use to provide our enhanced service offerings. We count RGUs on a unique premises basis. In other words, a subscriber with multiple outlets in one premises is counted as one RGU and a subscriber with two homes and a subscription to our video service at each home is counted as two RGUs. We exclude DTH Subscribers from Basic Video Subscribers. 92 ----- (6) Enhanced Video Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video service over our broadband network via a digital video signal while subscribing to any recurring monthly service that requires the use of encryptionenabling technology. Enhanced Video Subscribers are counted on a unique premises basis. For example, a subscriber with one or more set-top boxes that receives our video service in one premises is generally counted as just one subscriber. An Enhanced Video Subscriber is not counted as a Basic Video Subscriber. As we migrate customers from basic to enhanced video services, we report a decrease in our Basic Video Subscribers equal to the increase in our Enhanced Video Subscribers. We exclude DTH Subscribers from Enhanced Video Subscribers. (7) DTH Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video programming broadcast directly via a geosynchronous satellite. (8) Internet Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives internet services over our networks. Our Internet Subscribers do not include customers that receive services from dial-up connections. (9) Telephony Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives voice services over our networks. Telephony Subscribers exclude mobile telephony subscribers. (10) Mobile Subscriber is an active subscriber identification module (“SIM”) card in service rather than services provided. For example, if a Mobile Subscriber has both a data and voice plan on a smartphone this would equate to one Mobile Subscriber. Alternatively, a subscriber who has a voice and data plan for a mobile handset and a data plan for a laptop (via a dongle) would be counted as two Mobile Subscribers. Customers who do not pay a recurring monthly fee are excluded from our Mobile Subscriber counts after periods of inactivity ranging from 30 to 90 days, based on industry standards within the respective country. Most of our telecommunications subsidiaries provide mobile, fixed-line telephony, broadband internet, video or other business services. We generally do not count customers of business services as customers or RGUs for external reporting purposes. Subscriber statistics are generally presented in accordance with Liberty Global’s policies. Liberty Global’s review of our subscriber policies is ongoing and further adjustments are possible.",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

952_1,Offerings 2017.md,212,BUSINESS,212.10,Residential Services,212.10.1,,"_Mobile Services._ Other than in Trinidad & Tobago and Curacao, we offer mobile services throughout our operating footprint. We are a mobile network provider in Panama and most of our Caribbean markets, including the Bahamas and 94 ----- Jamaica. As a mobile network provider, we are able to offer a full range of voice and data services, including value-added services such as mobile internet, email access and short message service (“SMS”). Where available, our mobile services allow us to provide an extensive converged product offering, bundled with video, internet and fixed-line telephony, allowing our customers connectivity in and out of the home. We hold spectrum licenses as a mobile network provider, with terms typically ranging from 10 to 15 years. Subscribers to our mobile services pay varying monthly fees depending on whether the mobile service is bundled with one of our other services or includes mobile data services over their phones, tablets or laptops. Our mobile services are available on a postpaid or prepaid basis, with most customers purchasing a prepaid plan. We offer our customers the option to purchase mobile handsets with purchase terms typically related to whether the customer selects a prepaid or postpaid plan. Customers selecting a prepaid plan or service pay in advance for a pre-determined amount of airtime or data and generally do not enter into a minimum contract term. Customers subscribing to a postpaid plan generally enter into contracts ranging from 12 to 24 months. The long-term contracts are often taken with a subsidized mobile handset. For each SIM card, we typically charge a one-time activation fee to our prepaid customers. Calls within and out of network incur a separate charge if not covered within a prepaid plan or under a postpaid monthly service plan. Our mobile services include voice, SMS and internet access via data plans. _Telephony Services._ We are the incumbent fixed-line telephony service provider in many of our Caribbean markets and in certain markets we are the sole fixed-line provider. We offer multi-feature telephony service over our various fixed networks, including cable, DSL, FTTx and copper networks. Depending on location, these services are provided via either circuit-switched telephony or voice-over-internet-protocol (“VoIP”) technology. As the need arises, we are replacing obsolete switches with VoIP technology and older copper networks with modern fiber optics, as we continue to develop and invest in new technologies that will enhance our customers’ experiences. These digital telephony services range from usage-based to unlimited international, local and domestic services. _Video Services._ We offer video services in most of our residential markets, including Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, Panama, Barbados and the Bahamas. In terms of number of subscribers, we believe we are the market leader in 7 of our 16 residential video markets. To meet the demands of our customers, we have enhanced our video services with next generation, market leading digital television platforms that enable our customers to control when and where they watch their programming. These advanced services are delivered over our FTTx, very high-speed DSL technology (“VDSL”) and hybrid fiber coaxial cable networks and include an advanced electronic programming guide, digital video recorders (“DVR”) and video-on-demand (“VoD”). For example, in most of our markets, customers can pause their programming while the live broadcast is in progress. In most of our markets, customers have access to VoD, which offers thousands of movies and other video content, including kids programming, documentaries, adult, sports and television series. Our VoD service features content available on a transaction basis and VoD content available with the channel tiers, as we offer several premium channels. Customers who subscribe to our video service receive a VoD enabled set-top box without an additional monthly charge. We tailor our VoD services to the specific market based on available content, consumer preferences and competitive offers. We continue to develop our VoD services to provide a growing collection of programming from leading local and international suppliers. In most of our markets, we offer a comprehensive internet streaming video service (marketed as “Flow ToGo” and “Master ToGo”) that allows our video customers to stream an increasing number of video channels anywhere they have a broadband connection in and out of the home and on multiple devices. All of our operations with video services offer multiple tiers of digital video programming and audio services starting with a basic video service. All digital video services are encrypted and require a set-top box provided by us. Subscribers to our basic video service pay a fixed monthly fee and generally receive at least 100 video channels, including a number of high definition (“HD”) channels, and several digital radio channels. This service includes VoD access and an electronic programming guide. We also offer a variety of premium channel packages, including HD channels. For an additional monthly charge, a subscriber may upgrade to one of our 95 ----- extended digital tier services and receive an increased number of video channels, which include channels in the basic tier of service and additional HD channels. Subscribers may also subscribe to one or more packages of premium channels for an additional monthly charge. In the few markets where our analog service is still available, subscribers to that service typically receive fewer channels than subscribers to our basic video service, with the number of channels dependent on their location. We operate the leading Caribbean sports network, Flow Sports, which provides exclusive full coverage of the Premier League and other leading sporting events. We tailor our video services in each country of operation based on the programing preferences, culture, demographics and local regulatory requirements. Our channel offerings include local and international general entertainment, sports, movies, documentaries, life styles, news, adult, children and foreign channels, as well as U.S. broadcast network channels. In all of our video operations, we continue to upgrade our systems to expand our digital services and encourage our remaining analog subscribers to convert to a digital or premium digital service. Discounts to our monthly service fees generally are available to any subscriber who selects a bundled service of at least any two of the following services: video, internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile. _Internet Services._ Our customers are increasingly using online communications. To support our customers’ expectations for seamless connectivity, we are expanding our networks to make ultrafast broadband available to more people. This includes investment in the convergence of our fixed and mobile data systems and making wireless systems available in the home. In 2016, we improved the connectivity of over 200,000 homes in Panama and other markets through network extensions and upgrade projects. In 2017, we intend to further improve connectivity through network extensions and upgrades, including migrating customers from legacy copper networks to cable or fiber networks. We launched the Connect Box, a next generation WiFi and telephony gateway that enables us to maximize the impact of our ultrafast broadband networks by providing reliable wireless connectivity anywhere in the home, to our markets beginning in 2017. The Connect Box has an automatic WiFi optimization function, which selects the best possible wireless frequency at any given time. This gateway can be self-installed and allows customers to customize their home WiFi service. The internet speeds we offer are one of our differentiators, as customers spend more time streaming video and other bandwidth-heavy services on multiple devices. As a result, we are continuing to invest in additional bandwidth and technologies to increase internet speeds throughout our footprint. We plan to continue the upgrade and expansion of our fixed networks so that we can deploy high-speed internet service to additional customers in the coming years. Our residential subscribers access the internet via DSL over our fixed-line telephony networks or via cable modems connected to their internet capable devices, including personal computers, or wirelessly via the Connect Box. Our internet service generally includes email, address book and parental controls with value-added services available for additional incremental charges. Our value-added services include security measures and online storage. Mobile broadband internet services are also available through our mobile services described above. Subscribers to our internet service pay a monthly fee based on the tier of service selected. In addition to the monthly fee, customers pay an activation service fee upon subscribing to an internet service. This one-time fee may be waived for promotional reasons. We determine pricing for each different tier of internet service through an analysis of speed, market conditions and other factors.",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

This network is composed primarily of fiber networks that are connected to the home over the last few hundred meters by coaxial cable. In several of our Caribbean markets, our services are transmitted over a fixed network consisting of FTTx, VDSL or copper lines. Approximately 94% of our network allows for two-way communications and is flexible enough to support our current services as well as new services. We closely monitor our network capacity and customer usage. We continue to take actions and explore improvements to our technologies that will increase our capacity and enhance our customer’s connected entertainment experience. These actions include: - recapturing bandwidth and optimizing our networks by: - increasing the number of nodes in our markets; - increasing the bandwidth of our hybrid fiber coaxial cable networks; - converting analog channels to digital; - bonding additional data over cable service interface specification (“DOCSIS”) 3.0 channels; - deploying VDSL over our fixed telephony network; - replacing copper lines with modern optic fibers; and - using digital compression technologies. - freeing spectrum for high-speed internet, VoD and other services by encouraging customers to move from analog to digital services; - increasing the efficiency of our networks by moving headend functions (encoding, transcoding and multiplexing) to cloud storage systems; - enhancing our network to accommodate further business services; - using our wireless technologies to extend services outside of the home; - offering remote access to our video services through laptops, smart phones and tablets; - expanding the availability of next generation decoder boxes (such as Horizon TV) and related products as well as developing and introducing online media sharing and streaming or cloud-based video; and - testing new technologies. 98 ----- We are expanding our hybrid fiber coaxial cable network through our network extension programs pursuant to which we connect additional homes and businesses to our broadband communications network (“network",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

In addition, we are seeking mobile service opportunities where we have established cable networks",212.13.1,,"and expanding our fixed-line networks where we have a strong mobile offering. This will allow us to offer converged fixed-line and mobile services to our customers. We deliver high-speed data and fixed-line telephony over our broadband network in most of our markets over our various fixed networks, including cable, DSL, FTTx and copper networks. These networks are further connected via our subsea and terrestrial fiber optic cable network that provide connectivity within and outside the region. Our sub-sea network cables terminating in the United States carry over 3Tbit/s which represent less than 10% of their potential capacity based on current deployed technology.",N/A,as_expected,2017,928
952_1,Offerings 2017.md,212,BUSINESS,212.14,Supply Sources,212.14.1,,"_Content_ With telecommunication companies increasingly offering similar services, content is one of the deciding factors for customers in selecting a video services provider. Therefore, in addition to providing services that allow our customers to view programming when and where they want, we are investing in content that customers want. Our content strategy is based on: - proposition (meeting and exceeding our customers’ entertainment expectations); - product (delivering the best content anywhere and anytime); - acquisition (investment in the best channel brands and exclusive sports); and - partnering (strategic alignment with content partners and growth opportunities). Except for our Flow Sports and Flow 1 services in the Caribbean, we license almost all of our programming and on-demand offerings through distribution agreements with third-party content providers and rights holders, including broadcasters and cable programming networks. For such licenses, we generally pay a monthly fee on a per channel or per subscriber basis, with minimum guarantees in certain cases. We often enter into long-term programming licenses with volume discounts and marketing support. For our distribution agreements, we seek to include the rights to offer the licensed channels and programming to our customers through multiple delivery platforms including through our apps for IP devices and websites. We also acquire rights to make available, in selected markets, basic and/or premium video services to mobile and/or broadband subscribers that are not TV subscribers. In seeking licenses for content, our primary focus is on partnering with leading international providers, such as Disney/ESPN, Time Warner/HBO, Fox and Discovery. We also seek to carry in each of our markets key local broadcasters. For our VoD services, we license a variety of programming, including movies, music, kids programming, documentaries and local productions from Caribbean Tales. In addition, Liberty Global has entered into a multi-year revenue sharing arrangement with Netflix Inc. (“Netflix”), pursuant to which, when implemented, will allow us to provide our customers with premium OTT services. The partnership will result in Netflix’s content being available via set-top boxes to our video customers across all of our markets. Exclusive content is also central to our content strategy in order to differentiate our video proposition. We operate the leading Caribbean sports network, Flow Sports, which provides full coverage of the English Premier League and other leading sporting events across a basic channel (that we also offer for distribution to other Caribbean pay-TV operators on a wholesale basis) and a premium services, Flow Sports Premier, that includes a multiscreen proposition, which is exclusively available to our video subscribers. _Mobile handsets and Customer Premises Equipment_ We use a variety of suppliers for mobile handsets to offer our customers mobile services. For other customer premises equipment, we purchase from a number of different suppliers with at least two or more suppliers providing our high volume products. Customer premises equipment includes set-top boxes, modems, WiFi routers, DVRs, tuners and similar devices. For each type of equipment, we retain specialists to provide customer support. For our broadband services, we use a variety of suppliers for our network equipment and the various services we offer. 99 ----- _Software Licenses_ We license software products, including email and security software as well as content, such as news feeds, from several suppliers for our internet services. The agreements for these products require us to pay a per subscriber fee for software licenses and a share of advertising revenue for content licenses. For our mobile network operations and our fixed-line telephony services, we license software products, such as voicemail, text messaging and caller ID, from a variety of suppliers. For these licenses we seek to enter into long-term contracts, which generally require us to pay based on usage of the services.",N/A,as_expected,2017,928
952_1,Offerings 2017.md,212,BUSINESS,212.15,Competition,212.15.1,,"We operate in an emerging region of the world, where market penetration of telecommunication services such as broadband and mobile data is lower than in more developed markets. Generally, our markets are at a nascent stage of the global shift to a “data-centric” world. Although there has been strong growth in data consumption in our key markets, data consumption in our operating regions still lags significantly when compared to international benchmarks. We believe that we have the opportunity to capitalize upon this underlying growth trend in the majority of our markets, and benefit from increasing penetration of our data services, as well as economic growth, in all of our markets. However, technological advances and product innovations have increased and are likely to continue to increase giving customers several options for the provision of their telecommunications services. Our customers want access to high quality telecommunication services that allow for seamless connectivity. Accordingly, our ability to offer converged services (video, internet, fixed telephony and mobile) is a key component of our strategy. In many of our markets, we compete with companies that provide converged services, as well as companies that are established in one or more communication products and services. Consequently, our businesses face significant competition. In all markets, we seek to differentiate our telecommunication services by focusing on customer service, competitive pricing and offering quality high-speed internet. _Mobile and Telephony Services_ Consumers are increasingly moving to mobile services. In many of our markets we are either the leading or one of the leading mobile providers. In the markets where we are one of the top mobile providers, we continue to seek additional bandwidth to deliver our wide range of services to our customers and increase our LTE services. We also offer various calling plans, such as unlimited network, national or international calling, unlimited off-peak calling and minute packages, including calls to fixed and mobile phones. In addition, we use our bundled offers with our video and ultra high-speed internet services to gain mobile subscribers. Our ability to offer fixed-mobile convergence services is a key driver. In several of our markets we provide converged services, including mobile, fixed-line, broadband and video. We are also exploring opportunities to offer mobile services in markets where we currently only deliver fixed products and mobility applications to our other services. The market for fixed-line telephony services is mature in almost all of our markets. Changes in market share are driven by the combination of price and quality of services provided and the inclusion of telephony services in bundled offerings. In most of our markets, we are the incumbent telecommunications provider with long established customer relationships. In all of our markets, we also compete with other VoIP operators offering service across broadband lines and OTT telephony providers, such as WhatsApp. In many countries, our businesses also face competition from other cable telephony providers, FTTx-based providers or other indirect access providers. Competition exists in both the residential and business fixed-line telephony products due to market trends, the offering of carrier pre-select services, number portability, the replacement of fixed-line with mobile telephony and the growth of VoIP services, as well as continued deregulation of telephony markets and other regulatory action, such as general price competition. Carrier pre-select allows the end user to choose the voice services of operators other than the incumbent while using the incumbent’s network. Our fixed-line telephony strategy is focused around value leadership, and we position our services as “anytime” or “any destination.” Our portfolio of calling plans include a variety of innovative calling options designed to meet the needs of our subscribers. In many of our markets, we provide product innovation, such as telephone applications that allow customers to make and receive calls from their fixed-line call packages on smart phones. In addition, we offer varying plans to 100 ----- meet customer needs and, similar to our mobile services, we use our telephony bundle options with our digital video and internet services to help promote our telephony services and flat rate offers are standard. With respect to mobile services, we face competition from Digicel Group Ltd. (“Digicel”) in most of our residential markets and Movistar and Claro Panama, all subsidiaries of América Móvil, S.A.B. de C.V. (“Claro”) in Panama. In addition, in the Bahamas, where we had previously been the only provider of mobile services, competition has increased significantly due to the commercial launch of mobile services by Aliv, a mobile operator owned partly by Cable Bahamas during the fourth quarter of 2016. We also face competition in the provision of broadband services from Cable Onda S.A. (“Cable Onda”) in Panama, Digicel in our Caribbean markets and Cable Bahamas Limited (“Cable Bahamas”) in the Bahamas. These companies all have competitive pricing on similar services and the intensified level of competition we are experiencing in several of our markets has added increased pressure on the pricing of our services. To attract and retain customers, we focus on providing quality services and premium content, as well as converged services where customers can access content in and out-of-the home. _Video Distribution_ Our video services compete primarily with traditional FTA broadcast television services, DTH satellite service providers and other fixed-line telecommunications carriers and broadband providers, including operations offering (1) DTH satellite services, (2) internet protocol television (“IPTV”) over broadband internet connections using asymmetric DSL or VDSL or an enhancement to VDSL called “vectoring”, or (3) IPTV over FTTx networks. Many of these competitors have a national footprint and offer features, pricing and video services individually and in bundles comparable to what we offer. In certain markets, we also compete with other cable providers who have overbuilt portions of our systems. OTT aggregators utilizing our or our competitors’ high-speed internet connections are also a significant competitive factor as are other video service providers that overlap our service areas. The OTT video aggregators (such as HBO Go, Amazon Prime and Netflix) offer VoD service for television series and movies, catch-up television and linear channels from broadcasters. In some cases, these OTT services are provided free-of-charge. The content library of such services is offered on an unlimited basis for a monthly fee. Typically these services are available on multiple devices in and out of the home. Our businesses also compete to varying degrees with other sources of information and entertainment, such as online entertainment, newspapers, magazines, books, live entertainment/concerts and sporting events. We believe that our deep-fiber access, where available, provides us with several competitive advantages. For instance, our cable networks allow us to concurrently deliver internet access, together with real-time television and VoD content, without impairing our high-speed internet service. In addition, our cable infrastructure in most of our footprint allows us to provide triple-play bundled services of broadband internet, television and fixed-line telephony services without relying on a third-party service provider or network. Where mobile is available, our mobile networks, together with our fixed fiber-rich networks, allow us to provide a comprehensive set of converged mobile and fixed-line services. Our capacity is designed to support peak consumer demand. In serving the business market, many aspects of the network can be leveraged at very low incremental costs given that business demand peaks at a time when consumer demand is low, and peaks at lower levels than consumer demand. In response to the continued growth in OTT viewing, we have launched a number of innovative video services, including Flow ToGo in several of our markets. Our ability to continue to attract and retain customers depends on our continued ability to acquire appealing content and services on acceptable terms and to have such content available on multiple devices and outside the home. Some competitors have obtained long-term exclusive contracts for certain sports programs, which limits the opportunities for other providers to offer such programs. Other competitors also have obtained long-term exclusive contracts for programs, but our operations have limited access to certain of such programming through select contracts with those companies. If exclusive content offerings increase through other providers, programming options could be a deciding factor for subscribers on selecting a video service. To enhance our video offerings, we are developing cloud-based, next generation user interfaces based on advanced technologies. This is demonstrated by our recent launch of an advanced set-top box in most of our markets. Our competitors, however, are also improving their video services with interactive services and wireless connectivity. Many of our competitors offer competitively-priced packages of video content and, in some cases, offer double- and triple-play packages. 101 ----- We compete with a variety of pay TV service providers, with several of these competitors offering double-play and triple-play packages. Fixed-mobile convergence services are not a significant factor in most of our residential markets. In several of our markets, including Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados, we are the largest or one of the largest video service providers. In these markets, our primary competition is from DTH providers, such as DirecTV, and operators of IPTV services over VDSL and FTTx, such as Digicel. In Panama, we compete primarily with Cable Onda, which offers video, internet and fixed-line telephony over its cable network and with the DTH services of Claro Americas. To compete effectively, CWC invests in leading mobile and fixed networks, and in content, where the Premier League is a main attraction for Flow Sports. _Internet_ With respect to broadband internet services and online content, our businesses face competition in a rapidly evolving marketplace from incumbent and non-incumbent telecommunications companies, mobile operators and cable-based ISPs, many of which have substantial resources. The internet services offered by these competitors include both fixed-line broadband internet services using cable, DSL or FTTx networks and wireless broadband internet services. These competitors have a range of product offerings with varying speeds and pricing, as well as interactive services, data and other non-video services offered to homes and businesses. With the demand for mobile internet services increasing, competition from wireless services using various advanced technologies is a competitive factor. In several of our markets, competitors offer high-speed mobile data via LTE wireless networks. In addition, other wireless technologies, such as WiFi, are available in almost all of our markets. In this intense competitive environment, speed and pricing are key drivers for customers. Our strategy is speed leadership. Our focus is on increasing the maximum speed of our connections as well as offering varying tiers of service, prices and a variety of bundled product offerings and a range of value added services. We update our bundles and packages on an ongoing basis to meet the needs of our customers. Our top download speeds generally range from up to 100 Mbps to speeds of up to 350 Mbps. In Barbados, we also have speeds of up to 1 Gbps available. In many of our markets, we offer the highest download speeds available via our cable and FTTx networks. The focus is on high-end internet products to safeguard our high-end customer base and allow us to become more aggressive at the low- and medium-end of the internet market. By fully utilizing the technical capabilities of DOCSIS 3.0 technology on our cable systems, we can compete with local FTTx initiatives and create a competitive advantage compared to DSL infrastructures and LTE initiatives on a national level. With the commercial deployment of our next generation gateways that will enable DOCSIS 3.1 on our cable networks, we plan to further increase our high-speed internet offers. In several of our markets, we are the incumbent phone company offering broadband internet products using various DSL-based technologies. In these markets and our other Latin American markets, our key competition for internet services is from cable and IPTV operators and mobile data service providers. To compete effectively, we are expanding our LTE service areas and increasing our download speeds. In most of our markets, we offer our internet service through bundled offerings that include video and fixed-line telephony. We also offer a wide range of mobile products either on a prepaid or postpaid basis. Where we are the incumbent telecommunications provider, we compete with cable operators, the largest of which are Cable Onda in Panama and Cable Bahamas in the Bahamas. To a lesser extent, we experience competition from Digicel in certain of our markets. To distinguish ourselves from these competitors, we use our bundled offers with video and telephony to promote our broadband internet services. _Business and Wholesale Services_ We provide a variety of advanced, point-to-point, clear channel broadband capacity, internet protocol (“IP”), MPLS and Ethernet services over our owned and operated, technologically advanced, subsea fiber optic cable network. Our subsea and terrestrial fiber routes combine to form a series of fully integrated networks that provide complete operational redundancy, stability and reliability, allowing us to provide our clients with superior service and minimal network downtime. Given the advanced technical state of the network combined with the challenges in securing the necessary governmental and environmental licenses in all of our operating markets, we believe the network is unlikely to be replicated in the region. Competing networks in the region connect fewer countries than we do and are either linear in design, or if ringed, have high latency protection routes. In addition, our network as of March 31, 2017 utilized less than 10% of its design capacity, and we believe that our ability to take 102 ----- advantage of this large unused carrying capacity, as well as the financial and time investment required to build a similar network, and the potential delays associated with acquiring governmental permissions, makes it unlikely that our network will be replicated in the near term. We compete in the provision of B2B services with residential telecommunications operators as noted above, in addition to regional and international service providers, particularly when addressing larger customers. 103 -----",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

952_1,Offerings 2017.md,2018,REGULATORY MATTERS,2018.14,,2018.14.1,,"Video distribution, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile businesses are regulated in each of the countries in which we operate, and the scope of regulation varies from country to country. Adverse regulatory developments could subject our businesses to a number of risks. Regulation, including conditions imposed on us by competition or other authorities as a requirement to close acquisitions or dispositions, could limit growth, revenue and the number and type of services offered and could lead to increased operating costs and property and equipment additions. In addition, regulation may restrict our operations and subject them to further competitive pressure, including pricing rules and restrictions, interconnect and other access obligations, and restrictions or controls on content, including content provided by third parties. Failure to comply with current or future regulation could expose our businesses to various penalties. The video, broadband and telephony services we provide are subject to regulation and enforcement by various governmental and regulatory entities in each of the jurisdictions where such services are provided. The scope and reach of these regulations are distinct in each market. Generally, we provide services in accordance with licenses and concessions granted by national authorities pursuant to national telecommunication legislation and associated regulations. Certain of these regulatory requirements are summarized below. As the incumbent telecommunications provider in many of its jurisdictions, we are subject to significant regulatory oversight with respect to the provision of fixed-line and mobile telephony services. Generally, in these markets, we operate under a government issued license or concession that enables it to own and operate its telecommunication networks, including the establishment of wireless networks and the use of spectrum. These licenses and concessions are typically non-exclusive and have renewable multi-year terms that include competitive, qualitative and rate regulation. Licenses and concessions are scheduled to expire over the next two years in Jamaica, Cayman Islands and Barbados. CWC believes it has complied with all local requirements to have existing licenses renewed and have provided all necessary information to enable local authorities to process applications for renewal in a timely manner. CWC expects that such licenses will be granted or renewed, as applicable, on the same or substantially similar terms and conditions in a timely manner. Pending issuance of new or renewed licenses or concessions, CWC continues to operate on the same terms and conditions as previous the expired licenses. With respect to licenses for mobile spectrum, the initial grant of the spectrum is typically subject to an auction process, but in some cases may be granted on the basis of an administrative process at a set level of fees for a fixed period of time, typically to coincide with carrier licenses, subject to annual fees and compliance with applicable license requirements. Rate regulation of our telephony services typically includes price caps that set the maximum rates we may charge to customers, or legislation that requires consent from a regulator prior to any price increases. In addition, all regulators determine and set the rates that may be charged by all telephony operators, including CWC, for interconnect charges, access charges between operators for calls originating on one network that are completed through connections with one or more networks of other providers, and charges for network unbundling services. In addition, in certain markets, regulators set, or are seeking to set, mobile roaming rates. In recent years, a number of markets in which we operate have demonstrated an increased interest in regulating various aspects of broadband internet services due to the increasing importance and availability of high speed broadband. As broadband internet access has become a national priority for many of our markets, national regulators have demonstrated an increased focus on the issues of network resilience, broadband affordability and penetration, quality of services and consumer rights. Certain regulators are also seeking to mandate third-party access to our network infrastructure, including dark fibre and landing stations, as well as to regulate wholesale services and prices. Any such decision and application to grant access to our network infrastructure may strengthen our competitors by granting them ability to access to our network to offer competing products and services without making the corresponding capital intensive infrastructure investment. In addition, any resale access granted to competitors on favourable economic terms that are not set by the free market could adversely impact CWC’s ability to maintain or increase its revenue and cash flows. The extent of any such adverse impacts ultimately will be dependent on the extent that competitors take advantage of the resale access ultimately afforded to CWC’s network, the pricing mandated by regulatory authorities and other competitive factors or market developments. 104 ----- As examples of infrastructure sharing, the Office of Utilities Regulation (“OUR”) in Jamaica is in the process of conducting a consultation that could result in telecom facilities sharing rules that could require us to share our infrastructure (including dark fiber, ducts, subsea cable landing stations and mobile network towers) with third parties, including our competitors without any requirement of making a corresponding capital intensive infrastructure investment. CWC Jamaica intends to appeal and dispute any such ruling. In addition, the Eastern Caribbean Telecommunications Authority (“ECTEL”), the regulatory body for telecommunications in five Eastern Caribbean States (Commonwealth of Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts & Nevis, St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines), has adopted an Electronic Communications Bill that may have a material adverse impact on our operations in the ECTEL member states. The proposed Electronic Communications Bill includes provisions relating to: - net neutrality principles mandating equal access to all content and applications regardless of the source and without favoring, degrading, interrupting, intercepting, blocking access or throttling speeds; - subscription television rate regulation; - regulations implementing market dominance rules; - network unbundling at regulated rates; and - mandated unbundled access to all landing station network elements at cost-based rates. We currently cannot determine the impact these provisions will have on our operations because national regulators are required to conduct extensive market reviews before adopting specific measures and these measures might be reconsidered in accordance with the market reviews. It is currently unclear as to when the new legislation will be enacted. To become law, the legislation will need to be passed by the Parliament of each ECTEL state, and there remains some concerns by St. Lucia and Grenada about the impact of the legislation on operators like CWC. We expect that consensus on the final version of the bill will take some time. As such, the timing and ultimate effect of the bill is unclear. In Panama, as a result of a public consultation process, the regulator issued new guidelines and new quality goals for the Internet Public Service, by Resolution AN No.11370-Telco of June 26th, 2017, which goes into effect in January 2018. In addition to rate regulation, several markets in which we operate have imposed, or are considering imposing, regulation designed to further encourage competition, including introducing requirements related to unbundling, network access to third parties, and local number portability (“LNP”). LNP has been implemented in Panama, the Cayman Islands and Jamaica and is currently being contemplated or implemented in other jurisdictions, including Barbados, the Bahamas and Trinidad and Tobago. The pay television service provided in certain of our markets is subject to, among other things, subscriber privacy regulations and must-carry and retransmission consent rights of broadcast stations. We are subject to universal service obligations in a number of markets. These obligations vary in specificity and extent, but they are generally related to ensuring widespread geographic coverage of networks and that the populations of our individual markets have access to basic telecommunication services at minimum quality standards. In a number of cases, we are required to support universal access/service goals through contributions to universal service funds or participate in universal service related projects. In addition to the industry-specific regimes discussed above, our operating companies must comply with both specific and general legislation concerning, among other matters, data retention, consumer protection and electronic commerce. These operating companies are also subject to national level regulations on competition and on consumer protection. The acquisition of CWC by Liberty Global in May 2016 triggered regulatory approval requirements in certain jurisdictions in which we operate. The regulatory authorities in certain of these jurisdictions, including the Bahamas, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and the Seychelles, have not completed their review of the acquisition or granted their approval. While we expect to receive all outstanding approvals, such approvals may include binding conditions or requirements that could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial condition. 105 ----- In connection with the Columbus Acquisition, certain conditions were included in the regulatory approval of the transaction from the Telecommunications Authority of Trinidad and Tobago (“TATT”), including the requirement that we dispose of our 49% shareholding in the Telecommunications Services of Trinidad and Tobago Limited (“TSTT”) by a certain date, which was recently extended to September 30, 2017. We cannot predict when, or if, we will be able to dispose of this investment at an acceptable price. As such, no assurance can be given that we will be able to recover the carrying value of our investment in TSTT.",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant: (1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the second and third paragraphs of this covenant, the Company, in its sole discretion, will classify such item of Indebtedness on the date of its Incurrence and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of such clauses and will be permitted on the date of such Incurrence to divide and classify an item of Indebtedness in more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the second and third paragraphs of this covenant, and, from time to time, may reclassify all or a portion of such Indebtedness, in any manner that complies with this covenant; provided, however, that the CWC Initial Revolving Credit Commitments under the CWC Credit Agreement shall be deemed to have been Incurred under clause (1) of the third paragraph of this covenant and cannot be reclassified; (2) guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit relating to, Indebtedness which is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included; 172 ----- (3) if obligations in respect of letters of credit are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to the second paragraph or clause (1), clause (17), clause (18), clause (21), or clause (25) of the third paragraph of this covenant and the letters of credit relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included; (4) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Company or any Affiliate Proceeds Loan Obligor, or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof; (5) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness; and (6) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined in accordance with IFRS.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes an Affiliate Proceeds Loan Obligor or a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by an Affiliate Proceeds Loan Obligor or a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under this covenant, the Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant). For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Dollar Equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be (1) calculated by the Company based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower Dollar Equivalent), in the case of revolving credit Indebtedness; provided that if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-dominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-dominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced and (2) if and for so long as any such Indebtedness is subject to an agreement intended to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the currency in which such Indebtedness is denominated covering principal and interest on such Indebtedness, the swapped rate of such Indebtedness (if swapped into U.S. dollars) as of the date of the applicable swap. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company, any Affiliate Proceeds Loan Obligor and the Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. For purposes of determining compliance with (1) the second paragraph of this covenant and (2) any other provision of the Indenture which requires the calculation of any financial ratio or test, including the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, the Dollar Equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency (if such Indebtedness has not been swapped into U.S. dollars, or if such Indebtedness has been swapped into a currency other than U.S. dollars) shall be calculated by the Company using the same weighted average exchange rates for the relevant period used in the Consolidated financial statements of the Reporting Entity for calculating 173 ----- the Dollar Equivalent of Consolidated EBITDA denominated in the same currency as the currency in which such Indebtedness is denominated or into which it has been swapped. The Company and any Affiliate Proceeds Loan Obligor will not Incur, and will not permit any Proceeds Loan Obligor to Incur, any Indebtedness that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Company, any Affiliate Proceeds Loan Obligor or any Proceeds Loan Obligor that ranks pari _passu with or subordinated to the Proceeds Loan or Proceeds Loan Guarantee, as applicable, unless such_ Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Proceeds Loan or relevant Proceeds Loan Guarantee, on substantially identical terms (as conclusively determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or senior management of the Company or any Affiliate Proceeds Loan Obligor); provided, however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Company, any Affiliate Proceeds Loan Obligor, the Issuer, any Proceeds Loan Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary solely by virtue of being unsecured or secured on a junior Lien basis or by virtue of not being guaranteed or by virtue of the application of waterfall or other payment ordering provisions affecting different tranches of Indebtedness.",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

The term “all or substantially all” as used in the definition of “Change of Control” has not been interpreted under New York law (which is the governing law of the Indenture) to represent a specific quantitative test.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company, or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes by notice to the Company and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) under “—Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured by the Company, any Affiliate Proceeds Loan Obligor or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries or waived by the holders of the relevant Indebtedness within 20 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (a) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (b) all existing Events of Default, except non-payment of principal, premium or interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders unless such holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, when due, no holder of Notes may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such holder of Notes has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) holders of at least 50% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such holders of Notes have offered the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the 203 ----- Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture provides that in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use under the circumstances in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law, the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other holder of Notes or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to security or indemnification satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture provides that if a Default occurs and is continuing and is actually known to the Trustee, the Trustee must give notice of the Default within 90 days after it occurs. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, premium, if any, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of trust officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the holders. In addition, the Company, any Affiliate Proceeds Loan Obligor or the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, a certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Company, any Affiliate Proceeds Loan Obligor or the Issuer, as applicable, also is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Company, any Affiliate Proceeds Loan Obligor or the Issuer, as applicable, is taking or proposing to take in respect thereof. Whenever payment under the Notes has been accelerated due to an Event of Default under the Indenture, the Issuer as lender under the Proceeds Loan shall, by immediate notice to the Proceeds Loan Borrower: (1) declare that an event of default under the Proceeds Loan has occurred; and (2) declare that all amounts outstanding under the Proceeds Loan are immediately due and payable. If such acceleration of the Notes is annulled or rescinded, the Issuer shall rescind any acceleration of the Proceeds Loan by immediate notice to the Proceeds Loan Borrower.",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

No appraisals of the Proceeds Loan Collateral have been made in connection with this offering of the Notes or the incurrence of the Proceeds Loan. By its nature, some or all of the Proceeds Loan Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value.

The Company Share Pledge will be governed by the laws of the relevant Approved Jurisdiction in which the Fold-in Issuer is organized. The Liens will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to providers of Liens (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, thin capitalization, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Liens is restricted by the terms of the Holdco Intercreditor Agreement and will be at the discretion of the relevant creditors as set forth in the Holdco Intercreditor Agreement (“Description of Other Indebtedness—Holdco Intercreditor Agreement—Enforcement”). The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Liens may also be restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is secured by the Proceeds Loan Collateral in compliance with the Indenture.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company, any Affiliate Proceeds Loan Obligor and the Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. For purposes of determining compliance with (1) the second paragraph of this covenant and (2) any other provision of the Indenture which requires the calculation of any financial ratio or test, including the Consolidated 274 ----- Net Leverage Ratio, the Dollar Equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency (if such Indebtedness has not been swapped into U.S. dollars, or if such Indebtedness has been swapped into a currency other than U.S. dollars) shall be calculated by the Company using the same weighted average exchange rates for the relevant period used in the Consolidated financial statements of the Reporting Entity for calculating the Dollar Equivalent of Consolidated EBITDA denominated in the same currency as the currency in which such Indebtedness is denominated or into which it has been swapped. The Company and any Affiliate Proceeds Loan Obligor will not Incur, and will not permit any Proceeds Loan Obligor to Incur, any Indebtedness that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Company, any Affiliate Proceeds Loan Obligor or any Proceeds Loan Obligor that ranks pari _passu with or subordinated to the Proceeds Loan or Proceeds Loan Guarantee, as applicable, unless such_ Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Proceeds Loan or relevant Proceeds Loan Guarantee, on substantially identical terms (as conclusively determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or senior management of the Company or any Affiliate Proceeds Loan Obligor); provided, however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Company, any Affiliate Proceeds Loan Obligor, the Issuer, any Proceeds Loan Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary solely by virtue of being unsecured or secured on a junior Lien basis or by virtue of not being guaranteed or by virtue of the application of waterfall or other payment ordering provisions affecting different tranches of Indebtedness.",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

The ability of the Issuer to repurchase Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—We may not be able to obtain enough funds _necessary to finance an offer to repurchase your Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control (as defined in the Indenture) as required by the Indenture.”_ 268 ----- The Trustee or its authenticating agent will promptly authenticate and deliver a new note or notes equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of Notes surrendered, if any, to the holder of Notes in global form or to each holder of certificated notes; provided that each such new note will be in a principal amount of $200,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Purchase Date.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer. If holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the date of the delivery of the notice for such redemption. The term “all or substantially all” as used in the definition of “Change of Control” has not been interpreted under New York law (which is the governing law of the Indenture) to represent a specific quantitative test. As a consequence, in the event the holders of the Notes elect to exercise their rights under the Indenture and the Issuer elects to contest such election, there could be no assurance as to how a court interpreting New York law would interpret the phrase. The provisions of the Indenture will not afford holders of the Notes the right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes in the event of a highly leveraged transaction, certain transactions with the Company’s management or its Affiliates or certain other sale transactions, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or similar transaction (including, in certain circumstances, an acquisition of the Company and/or an Affiliate Proceeds Loan Obligor by management or its affiliates) involving the Issuer that may adversely affect holders of the Notes, if such transaction is not a transaction defined as a Change of Control. The provisions under the Indenture related to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control. The Issuer will comply with the applicable tender offer rules, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and any other applicable securities laws or regulations in connection with a Change of Control Offer.

No such purchase in part shall reduce the principal amount at maturity of the Notes held by any holder to below $200,000. Unless the Fold-In Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, within 30 days of any Change of Control, or, at the Fold-In Issuer’s option, at any time prior to a Change of Control following the public announcement thereof or if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control, the Fold-In Issuer shall notify the Trustee thereof and give written notice of such Change of Control to each holder stating to the extent relevant, among other things: - that a Change of Control has occurred (or may occur) and the date (or expected date) of such event; - the circumstances and relevant facts regarding such Change of Control; - the purchase price and the purchase date which shall be fixed by the Fold-In Issuer on a Business Day no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed, or delivered, or such later date as is necessary to comply with requirements under the Exchange Act; - that any Note not tendered will continue to accrue interest and unless the Fold-In Issuer defaults in payment of the Change of Control Purchase Price, any Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer shall cease to accrue interest after the Change of Control Purchase Date; and - certain other procedures that a holder must follow to accept a Change of Control Offer or to withdraw such acceptance. If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the International Stock Exchange and the rules of the International Stock Exchange so require, the Company will publish a public announcement with respect to the results of any Change of Control Offer in a leading newspaper of general circulation in the Channel Islands or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notice on the official website of the International Stock Exchange. The ability of the Fold-In Issuer to repurchase Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—We may not be able to obtain _enough funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase your Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control (as defined in the Indenture) as required by the Indenture.”_ The Trustee or its authenticating agent will promptly authenticate and deliver a new note or notes equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of Notes surrendered, if any, to the holder of Notes in global form or to each holder of certificated notes; provided that each such new note will be in a principal amount of $200,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Fold-In Issuer will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Purchase Date. The Fold-In Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Fold-In Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer. If holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Fold-In Issuer, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Fold-In Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Fold-In Issuer or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the date of the delivery of the notice for such redemption. 364 ----- The term “all or substantially all” as used in the definition of “Change of Control” has not been interpreted under New York law (which is the governing law of the Indenture) to represent a specific quantitative test. As a consequence, in the event the holders of the Notes elect to exercise their rights under the Indenture and the Fold-In Issuer elects to contest such election, there could be no assurance as to how a court interpreting New York law would interpret the phrase. The provisions of the Indenture will not afford holders of the Notes the right to require the Fold-In Issuer to repurchase the Notes in the event of a highly leveraged transaction, certain transactions with the Company’s management or its Affiliates or certain other sale transactions, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or similar transaction (including, in certain circumstances, an acquisition of the Company by management or its affiliates) involving the Fold-In Issuer that may adversely affect holders of the Notes, if such transaction is not a transaction defined as a Change of Control. The provisions under the Indenture related to the Fold-In Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control. The Fold-In Issuer will comply with the applicable tender offer rules, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and any other applicable securities laws or regulations in connection with a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any applicable securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this covenant (other than the obligation to make an offer pursuant to this covenant), the Fold-In Issuer will comply with the securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in this covenant by virtue thereof.",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

The Liens over some or all of the Collateral may also be released in circumstances described under “—Releases.” No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Fold-In Issuer or any other Guarantor in connection with the issuance of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the proceeds from the sale of the Collateral remaining after sharing with other creditors entitled to share in such proceeds would be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the holders of the Notes.

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant: (1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Fold-In Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify such item of Indebtedness on the date of its Incurrence and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of such clauses and will be permitted on the date of such Incurrence to divide and classify an item of Indebtedness in more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, and, from time to time, may reclassify all or a portion of such 456 ----- Indebtedness, in any manner that complies with this covenant; provided, however, that the CWC Initial Revolving Credit Commitments under the CWC Credit Agreement shall be deemed to have been Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant and cannot be reclassified; (2) guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit relating to, Indebtedness which is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included; (3) if obligations in respect of letters of credit are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph or clause (1), clause (17), clause (18), clause (21), or clause (25) of the second paragraph of this covenant and the letters of credit relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included; (4) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Fold-In Issuer or the Affiliate Issuer, or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof; (5) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness; and (6) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined in accordance with IFRS.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes an Affiliate Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by an Affiliate Issuer or Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under this covenant, the Fold-In Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant). For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Dollar Equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be (1) calculated by the Fold-In Issuer based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower Dollar Equivalent), in the case of revolving credit Indebtedness; provided that if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-dominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-dominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced and (2) if and for so long as any such Indebtedness is subject to an agreement intended to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the currency in which such Indebtedness is denominated covering principal and interest on such Indebtedness, the swapped rate of such Indebtedness (if swapped into U.S. dollars) as of the date of the applicable swap. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Fold-In Issuer, the Affiliate Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. For purposes of determining compliance with (1) the first paragraph of this covenant and (2) any other provision of the Indenture which requires the calculation of any financial ratio or test, including the Consolidated Net 457 ----- Leverage Ratio, the Dollar Equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency (if such Indebtedness has not been swapped into U.S. dollars, or if such Indebtedness has been swapped into a currency other than U.S. dollars) shall be calculated by the Fold-In Issuer using the same weighted average exchange rates for the relevant period used in the Consolidated financial statements of the Reporting Entity for calculating the Dollar Equivalent of Consolidated EBITDA denominated in the same currency as the currency in which such Indebtedness is denominated or into which it has been swapped. The Fold-In Issuer and the Affiliate Issuer will not Incur, and will not permit any Guarantor to Incur, any Indebtedness that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Fold-In Issuer, the Affiliate Issuer or any Guarantor that ranks pari passu with or subordinated to the Notes or the Note Guarantee, as applicable, unless such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or the relevant Note Guarantee on substantially identical terms (as conclusively determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or senior management of the Fold-In Issuer or the Affiliate Issuer); provided, however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Fold-In Issuer, the Affiliate Issuer, any Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary solely by virtue of being unsecured or secured on a junior Lien basis or by virtue of not being guaranteed or by virtue of the application of waterfall or other payment ordering provisions affecting different tranches of Indebtedness.",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

The ability of the Fold-In Issuer to repurchase Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—We may not be able to obtain _enough funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase your Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control (as defined in the Indenture) as required by the Indenture.”_ The Trustee or its authenticating agent will promptly authenticate and deliver a new note or notes equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of Notes surrendered, if any, to the holder of Notes in global form or to each holder of certificated notes; provided that each such new note will be in a principal amount of $200,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Fold-In Issuer will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Purchase Date. The Fold-In Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Fold-In Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer. If holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Fold-In Issuer, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Fold-In Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Fold-In Issuer or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the date of the delivery of the notice for such redemption. The term “all or substantially all” as used in the definition of “Change of Control” has not been interpreted under New York law (which is the governing law of the Indenture) to represent a specific quantitative test.

The provisions under the Indenture related to the Fold-In Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control.

The Indenture provides that if a Default occurs and is continuing and is actually known to the Trustee, the Trustee must give notice of the Default within 90 days after it occurs.

The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, DTC will credit on its respective bookentry registration and transfer systems a participant’s account with the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, “holders” of Book-Entry Interests will not be considered the owners or “holders” of the Notes for any purpose.

Through and including the 40th day after the later of the commencement of the offering of the Notes and the closing of the offering (the “40-day period”), beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the 144A Global Note only if such transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A and the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a qualified institutional buyer within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with all applicable securities laws of any other jurisdictions.

See “Transfer Restrictions”. Transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for 144A Book-Entry Interest in a Global Note will be done by DTC by means of an instruction originating from the Registrar through the DTC Deposit/ Withdrawal Custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the relevant Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the corresponding 144A Global Note. The policies and practices of DTC may prohibit transfers of unrestricted Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Note prior to the expiration of the 40 days after the date of initial issuance of the Notes. Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first-mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest. 527 -----",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those operations or procedures. DTC has advised us that it is: - a limited purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law; - a “banking organization” under New York Banking Law; - a member of the Federal Reserve System; - a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code; and - a “clearing agency” registered under Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions among its participants. It does this through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of securities participants, eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. DTC’s owners are the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., the American Stock Exchange, Inc. and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and a number of its direct participants. Others, such as banks, brokers and dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant also have access to the DTC system and are known as indirect participants. Because DTC can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the DTC systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form.

Such laws and practices are subject to change, which changes may apply with retrospective effect. This summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all of the tax considerations that may be relevant. The summary only relates to the tax position of investors beneficially owning the Notes. Particular rules may apply to certain classes of taxpayers holding the Notes (for example, dealers in Notes etc). The summary does not constitute tax or legal advice and the comments below are of a general nature only. Prospective investors in the Notes should consult their professional advisers on the tax implications of the purchase, holding, transfer, redemption, disposal or sale of the Notes and the receipt of interest thereon under the laws of Ireland as well as under the laws of their country of residence, citizenship and/or domicile. This summary is based upon the law as in effect on the date of this Offering Memorandum and is subject to any change in law that may take effect after such date",65.5.1,,"_Withholding Tax_ Generally, Irish tax legislation provides that tax at the standard rate of income tax (currently 20 per cent) is required to be withheld from payments of Irish source interest (Section 246 (as amended) of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 (as amended) (the “TCA”)). However, the Issuer can pay interest on the Notes free of withholding tax provided it is a “qualifying company” (within the meaning of section 110 of the TCA) and provided the interest is paid to a person resident in a “relevant territory” (a Member State of the European Union (other than Ireland) or in a territory with which Ireland has a double taxation agreement). For this purpose, residence is determined by reference to the law of the country in which the recipient claims to be resident. This exemption will not apply, however, to a company, if the interest is paid to a company in connection with a trade or business carried on by that company in Ireland through a branch or agency. A further exemption from the requirement to withhold tax on interest payments exists under section 64 of the TCA for certain securities (known as “quoted Eurobonds”) issued by a company (such as the Issuer) which are quoted on a recognized stock exchange (which term is not defined but is understood to mean an exchange recognized in the jurisdiction where it is established, which would include The International Stock Exchange of the Channel Islands) and carry a right to interest. Any interest paid on such quoted Eurobonds can be paid free of withholding tax provided: a) the person by or through whom the payment is made is not in Ireland; or b) the payment is made by or through a person in Ireland, and either: i. the quoted Eurobond is held in a clearing system recognised by the Revenue Commissioners of Ireland (The Depositary Trust Company, Euroclear and Clearstream Banking SA and Clearstream Banking AG are so recognised); or ii. the person who is the beneficial owner of the quoted Eurobond and who is beneficially entitled to the interest is not resident in Ireland and has made an appropriate declaration to the relevant person (such as an Irish paying agent) in the prescribed form. _Taxation of Noteholders_ Notwithstanding that a Noteholder may receive interest on the Notes free of withholding tax in accordance with the summary outlined above; the Noteholder may still be liable to pay Irish income tax in respect of that interest. Interest paid on the Notes may have an Irish source and therefore be within the charge to Irish income tax, the 535 ----- universal social charge and / or PRSI. A Note issued by the Issuer may be regarded as property situated in Ireland (and be treated as Irish source income) on the grounds that the debt is deemed to be situate where the debtor resides. Ireland operates a self-assessment system in respect of income tax. Any person, including a person who is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland, with Irish source income comes within the scope of Irish income tax and levies. Persons who are resident in Ireland are liable to Irish tax on their world-wide income. However, interest on the Notes will be exempt from Irish income tax if: a) the Notes are quoted Eurobonds, are exempt from withholding tax, as set out above and: i. the recipient of the interest is not resident in Ireland and is regarded as being a resident of a relevant territory; or ii. the recipient is a company: A. which is controlled, whether directly or indirectly by persons who are resident in a relevant territory who are not, themselves controlled by persons who are not resident in a relevant territory; or B. the principal class of shares of which are substantially or regularly traded on a stock exchange in Ireland, or a relevant territory, or in a territory or on a stock exchange approved by the Irish Minister for Finance for these purposes, or a 75 per cent subsidiary of such company, or a company wholly owned by 2 or more such companies; or b) the recipient of the interest is resident in a relevant territory and either: i. the Issuer is a qualifying company and the interest is paid out of the assets of the Issuer; or ii. if the Issuer has ceased to be a qualifying company, the recipient of the interest is a company and the relevant territory in which the company is resident imposes a tax that generally applies to interest receivable in that territory by companies from sources outside it, or the interest is exempt from income tax under the provisions of a double taxation agreement that was then in force when the interest was paid or would have been exempt had a double taxation agreement that was signed at the date the interest was paid been in force at that date. For the purposes of the exemptions described at (a) and (b) above, the residence of the recipient in a relevant territory is determined by reference to: i. the relevant treaty between Ireland and the relevant territory, where such treaty has been entered into and has the force of law; ii. under the laws of that territory, where there is no relevant treaty which has the force of law. Interest on the Notes which does not fall within the above exemptions may be within the charge to Irish income tax. Notwithstanding these exemptions from income tax, a corporate recipient that carries on a trade in Ireland through a branch or agency in respect of which the Notes are held or attributed may have a liability to Irish corporation tax on the interest. In certain limited circumstances, a payment under the Notes, other than a payment equal to the amount subscribed for the Notes, which is considered dependent on the result of the Issuer’s business or which represents more than a reasonable commercial return can be re-characterised as a distribution which could be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax. A payment will not be re-characterised as a distribution to which dividend withholding tax could apply where, broadly, a) the Noteholder is an Irish tax resident person; 536 ----- b) the interest is subject to tax in a Relevant Territory, being a tax which generally applies to profits, income or gains received from sources outside that territory without any reduction computed by reference to the amount of that payment; c) for so long as the Notes remain quoted Eurobonds, the Noteholder is not a person which is a company which directly or indirectly controls the Issuer or which is controlled by a third company which directly or indirectly controls the Issuer or a person (including any connected persons) i. from whom the Issuer has acquired assets, ii. to whom the Issuer has made loans or advances, or iii. with whom the Issuer has entered into a return agreement (as defined in section 110(1) TCA) where the aggregate value of such assets, loans, advances or agreements represents 75% or more of the assets of the Issuer (any person falling within this category of person being a “Specified Person”); d) the Noteholder is an exempt pension fund, government body or other resident in a Relevant Territory (and is not a Specified Person); or e) the Issuer deducts from the payment an amount as interest withholding tax under section 246(2) TCA. _Qualifying Companies Holding Irish Specified Mortgages_ Section 22 of the Irish Finance Act, 2016 amends Section 110 TCA. It applies to qualifying companies which carry on a business of holding, managing or both holding and managing “specified mortgages”. A “specified mortgage” for this purpose is: a) a loan which is secured on, and which derives its value from, or the greater part of its value from, directly or indirectly, land in Ireland; b) a specified agreement which derives all of its value, or the greater part of its value, directly or indirectly, from land in Ireland or a loan to which paragraph (a) applies. A specified agreement is defined in Section 110 TCA and includes certain derivatives, swaps or similar arrangements. A specified mortgage does not include a specified agreement which derives its value or the greater part of its value from a CLO transaction, a CMBS/RMBS transaction, a loan origination business or a sub-participation transaction (as defined in Section 110 TCA); c) any portion of a security issued by another qualifying company which carries on the business of holding or managing specified mortgages and which carries a right to results dependent or non-commercial interest; or d) units in an Irish Real Estate Fund (within the meaning of Chapter 1B of Part 27 TCA); Such activity is defined as a “specified property business”. Where the qualifying company carries on a specified property business in addition to other activities, it must treat the specified property business as a separate business and apportion its expenses on a just and reasonable basis between the separate businesses. Where the qualifying company has financed itself with loans carrying interest which is dependent on the results of that company’s business or interest which represents more than a reasonable commercial return for the use of the principal, or has entered into specified agreements (such as swaps) then the interest or return payable will not be deductible for Irish tax purposes to the extent it exceeds a reasonable commercial return which is not dependent on the results of the qualifying company. This restriction is subject to a number of exceptions. Transactions which qualify as “CLO transactions” should not be subject to the restrictions described above. A CLO transaction is defined as a securitisation transaction carried out in conformity with: a) a prospectus, within the meaning of the Prospectus Directive; b) listing particulars, where any securities issued by the qualifying company are listed on an exchange, other than the main exchange, of Ireland or a relevant EU member state; or 537 ----- c) where the securities issued by the qualifying company will not be listed on an exchange in Ireland or a relevant EU member state, legally binding documents. In addition, the transaction i. may provide for a warehousing period, which means a period not exceeding 3 years during which time the qualifying company is preparing to issue securities; and ii. provide for investment eligibility criteria that govern the type and quality of assets to be acquired. Finally, based on the documents referred to in paragraphs (a) to (c) and the activities of the qualifying company, in order for a transaction to be a CLO transaction it must not be reasonable to consider that the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of the qualifying company was to acquire specified mortgages. In order to benefit from the exception, the qualifying company must not carry out any activities, other than activities which are incidental or preparatory to the transaction or business of a CLO transaction. As such, the restrictions on deductibility should not apply if either: a) the Issuer does not hold or manage specified mortgages; or b) the Issuer’s activities fall within the definition of a CLO transaction. In addition, the legislation does contain other provisions which could limit or eliminate the restrictions on deductibility depending on the structuring of the transaction. _Encashment Tax_ Irish tax will be required to be withheld at the standard rate of income tax (currently 20%) from interest on any Notes where such interest is collected or realised by a bank or encashment agent in Ireland on behalf of any Noteholder. There is an exemption from encashment tax where the beneficial owner of the interest is not resident in Ireland and has made a declaration to this effect in the prescribed form to the encashment agent or bank. _Capital Gains Tax_ A holder of Notes will be subject to Irish tax on capital gains on a disposal of Notes unless such holder is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland and does not carry on a trade in Ireland through a branch or agency in respect of which the Notes are used or held or to which or to whom the Notes are attributable. _Capital Acquisitions Tax_ A gift or inheritance comprising Notes will be within the charge to capital acquisitions tax if either (i) the disponer or the donee/successor in relation to the gift or inheritance is resident or ordinarily resident in Ireland (or, in certain circumstances, if the disponer is domiciled in Ireland irrespective of his residence or that of the donee/successor) or (ii) if the Notes are regarded as property situated in Ireland. Bearer notes are generally regarded as situated where they are physically located at any particular time and registered notes are generally regarded as situated where the principal register is maintained or obliged to be maintained. The Notes may be regarded as situated in Ireland regardless of their physical location or the location of the register as they are secured over Irish property, and they themselves secure a debt due by an Irish resident debtor. Accordingly, if such Notes are comprised in a gift or inheritance, the gift or inheritance may be within the charge to tax regardless of the residence status of the disponer or the donee/successor. _Stamp Duty_ No stamp duty is imposed in Ireland on the issue or transfer of the Notes (on the basis of an exemption provided for in Section 85(2)(c) to the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act, 1999) for so long as the Issuer is a qualifying company within the meaning of Section 110 of the TCA provided the money raised on the issue of the Notes is used in the course of the Issuer’s business. 538 ----- _FATCA Implementation in Ireland_ The governments of Ireland and the United States have signed an Agreement to Improve International Tax Compliance and to Implement FATCA (the “IGA”). The IGA is of a type commonly known as a “model 1” agreement. In July 2014, Ireland enacted Financial Accounts Reporting (United States of America) Regulations 2014 (the “Irish FATCA Regulations”). The IGA and Irish FATCA Regulations will increase the amount of tax information automatically exchanged between Ireland and the United States. They provide for the automatic reporting and exchange of information in relation to accounts held in Irish “financial institutions” by U.S persons and the reciprocal exchange of information regarding U.S. financial accounts held by Irish residents. The Issuer expects to be treated as a reporting “Financial Institution” for FATCA purposes and intends to carry on its business in such a way as to ensure that it is treated as complying with FATCA pursuant to the terms of the IGA and the Irish FATCA Regulations. Unless an exemption applies, the Company shall be required to register with the US Internal Revenue Service as a “reporting financial institution” for FATCA purposes. In order for the Issuer to comply with its FATCA obligations it will be required to report certain information to the Irish revenue Commissioners relating to Noteholders who, for FATCA purposes, are specified US persons, non-participating financial institutions or passive non-financial foreign entities (NFFEs) that are controlled by specified US persons. Any information reported by the Issuer to the Irish Revenue Commissioners will be communicated to the US Internal Revenue Service pursuant to the IGA. It is possible that the Irish Revenue Commissioners may also communicate this information to other tax authorities pursuant to the terms of any applicable double tax treaty, intergovernmental agreement or exchange of information regime. The Issuer or its agents shall be entitled to require Noteholders to provide any information regarding their FATCA status, identity or residency required by the Issuer to satisfy its FATCA obligations. Noteholders will be deemed, by their subscription for or holding of Notes to have authorised the automatic disclosure of such information by the Issuer or any other authorised person to the relevant tax authorities. The Issuer should not generally be subject to FATCA withholding tax in respect of its US source income for so long as it complies with its FATCA obligations. However, FATCA withholding tax may arise on US source payments to the Issuer if the Issuer does not comply with its FATCA registration and reporting obligations and the US Internal Revenue Service specifically identified the Issuer as being a ‘non-participating financial institution’ for FATCA purposes. In addition, the Issuer may be unable to comply with its FATCA obligations if Noteholders do not provide the required certifications or information. If an amount in respect of FATCA Withholding were to be deducted or withheld either from amounts due to the Issuer or from interest, principal or other payments made in respect of the Notes, neither the Issuer nor any paying agent nor any other person would, pursuant to the conditions of the Notes, be required to pay additional amounts as a result of the deduction or withholding. As a result, investors may receive less interest or principal than expected. Noteholders should consult their own tax advisors as to the potential implication of the reporting requirements imposed on the Issuer by FATCA before investing. _The Common Reporting Standard (CRS) in Ireland_ On 21 July 2014, the Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters was published by the OECD and this includes the CRS. The CRS provides that certain entities (known as Financial Institutions) shall identify “Accounts” (as defined, broadly equity and debt interests in the Financial Institution) held by persons who are tax resident in other CRS participating jurisdiction. That information is then subject to annual automatic exchange between governments in CRS participating jurisdictions. Ireland is a signatory jurisdiction to the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information, which was entered into by Ireland in its capacity as a signatory to the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters and which relates to the automatic exchange of financial account information in respect of CRS, while sections 891F and 891G of the TCA and regulations made thereunder contain measures necessary to implement the CRS internationally and across the European Union, respectively. Regulations, the Returns of Certain Information by Reporting Financial Institutions Regulations 2015 (the “CRS Regulations”), giving effect to the CRS from 1 January 2016 came into operation on 31 December 2015. 539 ----- Directive 2014/107/EU on Administrative Cooperation in the Field of Taxation (“DAC II”) implements CRS in a European context and creates a mandatory obligation for all EU Member States to exchange financial account information in respect of residents in other EU Member States on an annual basis commencing in 2017 in respect of the 2016 calendar year (or from 2018 in the case of Austria). The Irish Finance Act 2015 contained measures necessary to implement the DAC II. Regulations, the Mandatory Automatic Exchange of Information in the Field of Taxation Regulations 2015 (together with the CRS Regulations, the “Regulations”), giving effect to DAC II from 1 January 2016, came into operation on 31 December 2015. The Issuer is expected to constitute a Financial Institution for CRS purposes. In order to comply with its obligations under CRS and DAC II, the Issuer shall be entitled to require Noteholders to provide certain information in respect of the Noteholder’s and, in certain circumstances, their controlling persons’ tax status, identity or residence. Noteholders will be deemed, by their holding of the Notes, to have authorised the automatic disclosure of such information by the Issuer (or any nominated service provider) to the Irish Revenue Commissioners. The information will be reported by the Issuer to the Irish Revenue Commissioners who will then exchange the information with the tax or governmental authorities of other participating jurisdictions, as applicable. To the extent that the Notes are held within a recognised clearing system, the Issuer should have no reportable accounts in a tax year. Provided the Issuer complies with these obligations, it should be deemed compliant for CRS and DAC II purposes. Failure by the Issuer to comply with its CRS and DAC II obligations may result in it being deemed to be non-compliant in respect of its CRS obligations and monetary penalties may be imposed pursuant to the Irish implementing legislation.",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

A holder of the Notes who is not resident in Barbados, will not be taxable in Barbados in respect of the interest payments received from the Issuer on the Notes. _Capital Gains_ There are no capital gains taxes in Barbados. Gains arising on any sale, transfer or other disposition of the Notes will generally be considered capital gains under the Barbados tax laws in accordance with their general accounting treatment. A holder of the Notes who is not resident in Barbados, will not be subject in Barbados to any tax on gains realised on the disposal or redemption of such Note, except in cases where (a) the sale, transfer or other disposition of the Notes is deemed “an adventure or concern in the nature of trade,” and (b) that holder of the Notes is deemed to be carrying on business in Barbados in respect of the ownership of such Notes.

The Issuer believes that the Notes should not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments because of the possibility of such payments or redemptions. This position is based in part on assumptions regarding the likelihood, as of the date of issuance 542 ----- of the Notes, of such payments or redemptions. Assuming such position is respected, any amounts paid to a U.S. holder of the Notes pursuant to such redemption would be taxable as described below in “—Sale, Exchange, _Retirement or Taxable Disposition” and any such payments should be taxable as additional ordinary income_ when received or accrued, in accordance with such holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The IRS, however, may take a position contrary to the position described above, which could affect the amount, timing and character of a U.S. holder of the note’s income with respect to the Notes. A U.S. holder of the Notes that desires to take the position that the Notes are subject to the contingent payment debt instrument rules should consult with its tax advisor, including regarding the manner in which to disclose such position as required by applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations; the IRS may disagree with such holder’s contrary position.

The term “qualified stated interest” generally means stated interest that is unconditionally payable in cash or property (other than debt instruments of the Issuer), or that is treated as constructively received, at least annually at a single fixed rate. Interest including original issue discount (“OID”), if any, included in a U.S. holder of the Notes’ gross income with respect to the Notes will be treated as foreign source income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The limitation on non-U.S. taxes eligible for the U.S. foreign tax credit is calculated separately with respect to specific “baskets” of income. For this purpose, interest generally should constitute “passive category income”, or in the case of certain U.S. holders of the Notes, “general category income”. Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by a U.S. holder of the Notes at the rate applicable to the U.S. holder of the Notes may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations.

952_1,Offerings 2017.md,65,TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS,65.8,Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations,65.8.3,Original Issue Discount,"A Note may be treated as issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. An obligation generally is treated as having been issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes if its “stated redemption price at maturity” exceeds its issue price by at least the “OID de minimis amount”. The OID de minimis amount equals 1⁄4 of 1% of the debt instrument’s stated redemption price at maturity multiplied by the number of complete years from its issue date to its maturity. The “stated redemption price at maturity” of a Note is the sum of all payments required to be made on the Note other than qualified stated interest payments. If a Note is issued with OID, a U.S. holder of the Notes generally will be required to include OID in income before the receipt of the associated cash payment, regardless of such U.S. holder’s of the Notes accounting method for tax purposes. The amount of OID a U.S. holder of the Notes should include in income is the sum of the “daily portions” of the OID for the Note for each day during the taxable year (or portion of the taxable year) in which the Note is held by such U.S. holder of the Notes. The daily portion is determined by allocating a pro rata portion of the OID for each day of the accrual period. An accrual period may be of any length and the accrual periods may vary in length over the term of the Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first day of an accrual period or on the final day of an accrual period. The amount of OID allocable to an accrual period is equal to the difference between (1) the product of the “adjusted issue price” of the Note at the beginning of the accrual period and its yield to maturity (computed generally on a constant yield method and compounded at the end of each accrual period, taking into account the length of the particular accrual period) and (2) the amount of any qualified stated interest allocable to the accrual period. The “adjusted issue price” of a Note at the beginning of any accrual period generally is the sum of the issue price of the Note plus the amount of OID allocable to all prior accrual periods reduced by any payments received on the Note that were not qualified stated interest. 543 ----- Under these rules, a U.S. holder of the Notes generally will have to include in income increasingly greater amounts of OID in successive accrual periods. OID allocable to a final accrual period is the difference between the amount payable at maturity (other than a payment of qualified stated interest) and the adjusted issue price at the beginning of the final accrual period. Under the Treasury Regulations, a holder of a Note with OID may elect to include in gross income all interest that accrues on the Note using the constant yield method. Once made with respect to the Note, the election cannot be revoked without the consent of the IRS. A U.S. holder of the Notes considering an election under these rules should consult its own tax advisor. U.S. holders of the Notes may obtain information regarding the amount of OID, if any, the issue price, the issue date and yield to maturity by contacting The Directors, C&W Senior Financing Designated Company Activity, 32 Molesworth Street, Dublin 2, Ireland. The rules regarding OID are complex.

In that case, depending on the then-current circumstances and the manner in which the CWC Group Assumption is effected, the CWC Group Assumption could potentially result in a significant modification of the Notes, which would cause a deemed exchange of the Notes for “new” Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Assuming a significant modification results, U.S. holders of the Notes would generally recognize gain or loss as described under “Sale, Exchange, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition.” The amount deemed to be realized in such a taxable exchange would be the issue price of the “new” Notes, which would be the fair market value of the Notes as of the date of the deemed exchange if, as seems likely, the Notes are treated as publicly traded for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, a U.S. holder of the Notes could be treated as acquiring the “new” Notes with original issue discount (“OID”). This would occur if the issue price of the “new” Notes as of the date of the deemed exchange (based on the fair market value of the “new” Notes if the “new” Notes are treated as publicly traded for U.S. federal income tax purposes) was less than the stated principal amount of the “new” Notes by at least the “OID de minimis amount” (as described below). If the ‘‘new’’ Notes are issued with OID, a U.S. holder may be required to include such excess income as OID, as it accrues, in accordance with a constant yield method based on a compounding of interest before the receipt of cash payments attributable to this income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Except as noted above in this paragraph, the U.S. federal income tax considerations related to owning a “new” Note should generally be the same as the U.S. federal income tax considerations related to owning a Note. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors about their individual U.S. federal income tax considerations related to the potential CWC Group Assumption. In addition, the Issuer or the Fold-In Issuer may make certain alterations to the Notes or engage in certain transactions, including without limitation the Split-off or other reorganizations, mergers and consolidations as described above under the “Description of the Notes (Pre-Group Refinancing Transactions)”, “Description of the Notes (Post-Group Refinancing Transactions)”, “Description of the Fold-In Notes (Pre-Group Refinancing Transactions)” and “Description of the Fold-In Notes (Post-Group Refinancing Transactions)”. Depending on the circumstances surrounding such alterations or transactions, including whether there is an addition of any obligor or co-obligor on the Notes or a change in the obligor or co-obligor of the Notes, such alteration or transaction could result in a deemed taxable exchange to a U.S. holder of the Notes and the modified Note could be treated as newly issued at that time, potentially resulting in the recognition of taxable gain or loss. The Issuer or the Fold-In Issuer may be required to report certain information regarding such alterations or transactions that may be relevant to U.S. holders of the Notes either (1) by filing Form 8937 with the IRS and providing copies to certain of its holders of the Notes or (2) by posting the form on its website.",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

952_1,Offerings 2017.md,125,CERTAIN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN CONSIDERATIONS,125.1,,125.1.1,,"The U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), imposes certain fiduciary standards and certain other requirements on “employee benefit plans” (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) that are subject to Title I of ERISA, including, without limitation, entities such as collective investment funds, certain insurance company separate accounts, certain insurance company general accounts, and entities whose underlying assets are treated as being subject to ERISA (collectively, “ERISA Plans”), and on those persons who are fiduciaries with respect to ERISA Plans. Any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan under ERISA. Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA’s general fiduciary requirements, including the requirement of investment prudence and diversification and the requirement that an ERISA Plan’s investments be made in accordance with the documents governing the ERISA Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Laws (as defined below). Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan, as well as those plans that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, such as individual retirement accounts and Keogh plans (together with ERISA Plans, “Plans”), and certain persons who are “parties in interest” within the meaning of Section 3(14) of ERISA, or “disqualified persons”, within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, having certain relationships to Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is applicable to the transaction. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and/or other liabilities under ERISA and the Code, and the transaction may have to be rescinded. Prohibited transactions within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code may arise if the Notes are acquired with the assets of a Plan with respect to which the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers or the Trustee, or any of their respective affiliates, is a party in interest or a disqualified person. Even if none of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers or the Trustee is a party in interest or a disqualified person, a prohibited transaction may arise if the fiduciary authorizing the investment has an interest in or affiliation with any of the foregoing parties that may affect his, her or its judgment as a fiduciary. Certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code may be applicable, however, depending in part on the type of Plan fiduciary making the decision to acquire a Note and the circumstances under which such decision is made. Included among these exemptions are Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption (“PTCE”) 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 84-14, as amended (relating to transactions effected by “independent qualified professional asset managers”), PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTCE 95-60 (relating to investments by insurance company general accounts), and PTCE 96-23, as amended (relating to transactions effected by in-house asset managers), (collectively, the “Investor-Based Exemptions”). There is also a statutory exemption that may be available under Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code to a party in interest that is a service provider to a Plan investing in the Notes for adequate consideration, provided such service provider is not (i) the fiduciary with respect to the Plan’s assets used to acquire the Notes or an affiliate of such fiduciary or (ii) an affiliate of the employer sponsoring the Plan (the “Service Provider Exemption”). “Adequate consideration” means fair market as determined in good faith by the Plan fiduciary pursuant to regulations to be promulgated by the U.S. Department of Labor. However, there can be no assurance that any of these Investor-Based Exemptions, the Service Provider Exemption, or any other administrative or statutory exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the Notes. “Governmental plans” (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain “church plans” (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA or Section 4975(g)(3) of the Code) and certain non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA or the provisions of Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to U.S. federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations (such as the prohibited transaction rules of Section 503 of the Code) that are substantially similar to the foregoing provisions of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (“Similar Laws”). The purchase of the Notes using the assets of a Plan might be deemed to be a violation of the prohibited transaction rules of Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code for which no exemption may be 546 ----- available. Accordingly, the Notes may not be purchased using the assets of any Plan if the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee or their respective affiliates is the sponsor of, or Fiduciary to, such Plan in the absence of an applicable exemption.

In addition, the Notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Transfer _Restrictions”. The Issuer will apply to list the Notes on the Official List of the International Stock Exchange._ Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may at its sole option at any time, without the consent of the holders of the Notes or the Trustee, de-list the Notes from any stock exchange for the purposes of moving the listing of such Notes to the Official List of the International Stock Exchange. The Initial Purchasers have advised the Issuer that they intend to make a market in the Notes, but they are not obligated to do so. The Initial Purchasers may discontinue any market making in the Notes at any time in their sole discretion. In addition, such market making activities will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange Act. Accordingly, the Issuer cannot assure you that a liquid trading market will develop for the Notes, that you will be able to sell your Notes at a particular time or that the prices that you receive when you sell will be favorable.

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be ten business days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+4”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in three business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors. In connection with the offering of the Notes, the Stabilizing Managers may engage in overallotment, stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and applicable rules of the U.K. Financial Services Authority. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the offering 551 ----- size, which creates a syndicate short position. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the Notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of those transactions. If the Stabilizing Managers engage in stabilizing or syndicate covering transactions, they may discontinue them at any time. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have arranged and made loans to subsidiaries of CWC in the past. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with, and/or own outstanding debt securities of, CWC and/or its affiliates have hedged, and are likely to hedge in the future, their credit exposure to the Issuer and/or its affiliates consistent with their risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform, various consulting, financial advisory, investment banking, commercial lending and capital markets services for CWC, and Liberty Global, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates provide CWC and/or its affiliates, from time to time, with hedging services, and may act as counterparties to certain hedging agreements entered into by CWC and/or its affiliates and such parties will receive customary fees and commissions for their services in such capacities. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, including securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of CWC. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

After the initial offering, the Initial Purchasers may change the offering price and any other selling terms. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell Notes through certain of their affiliates. In the Purchase Agreement, the Issuer has agreed that: (1) subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer will not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, or file with the Securities Exchange Commission a registration statement under the U.S. Securities Act relating to any debt securities, which are substantially similar to the Notes offered hereby, issued by the Issuer, having a maturity of more than one year from the date of issue of the Notes, without the prior consent of Goldman Sachs International with respect to the Notes, for a period of 30 days after the Time of Sale (as defined in the Purchase Agreement); and (2) the Issuer will indemnify the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, or contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities. Certain of the Initial Purchasers are not broker-dealers registered with the SEC, and therefore may not make sales of any Notes in the United States or to U.S. persons except in compliance with applicable U.S. laws and regulations. To the extent that any such Initial Purchaser intends to effect sales of the Notes in the United States, it will do so only through one or more affiliated U.S. registered broker dealers, or otherwise as permitted by applicable U.S. law.",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

Article 3(1) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation states that in the case of a company, the place of its registered office shall be presumed to be its COMI in the absence of proof to the contrary and assuming the registered office has not been moved to another EU member state within the three month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. In the decision by the European Court of Justice (“ECJ”) in relation to Eurofood IFSC Limited, the ECJ stated, in relation to the registered office presumption contained in Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 of 29 May 2000 on Insolvency Proceedings (which the Insolvency Regulation repealed and replaced), that the place of a company’s registered office is presumed to be the company’s COMI and stated that the presumption can only be rebutted if “factors which are both objective and ascertainable by third parties enable it to be established that an actual situation exists which is different from that which locating it at the registered office is deemed to reflect”. As the Issuer has its registered office in Ireland, has Irish directors, is registered for tax in Ireland and has an Irish corporate services provider, the Issuer does not believe that factors exist that would rebut this presumption, although this would ultimately be a matter for the relevant court to decide, based on the circumstances existing at the time when it was asked to make that decision.

The Issuer, the directors of the Isssuer, a contingent, prospective or actual creditor of the Issuer, or shareholders of the Issuer holding, at the date of presentation of the petition, not less than one-tenth of the voting share capital of the Issuer, are each entitled to petition the court for the appointment of an examiner. The examiner, once appointed, has the power to set aside contracts and arrangements entered into by the company after his appointment and, in certain circumstances, can avoid a negative pledge given by the company prior to his appointment. Furthermore, the examiner may sell assets which are the subject of a fixed charge. However, if such power is exercised he must account to the holders of the fixed charge for the amount realised and discharge the amount due to them out of the proceeds of sale. During the period of protection, the examiner will formulate proposals for a compromise or scheme of arrangement to assist the survival of the company or the whole or any part of its undertaking as a going concern. A scheme of arrangement may be approved by the Irish High Court or Circuit Court (as applicable) when at least one class of creditors has voted in favour of the proposals and the relevant Irish court is satisfied that such proposals are fair and equitable in relation to any class of members or creditors who have not accepted the proposals and whose interests would be impaired by the implementation of the scheme of arrangement. In considering proposals by the examiner, it is likely that secured and unsecured creditors would form separate classes of creditors. In the case of the Issuer, if the Trustee represented the majority in number and value of claims within the secured creditor class, the Trustee would be in a position to reject any proposal not in favour of the holders of the Notes. The Trustee would also be entitled to argue at the relevant Irish court hearing at which the proposed scheme of arrangement is considered that the proposals are unfair and inequitable in relation to the holders of the Notes, especially if such proposals include a writing down of the value of amounts due by the Issuer to the holders of the Notes. The primary risks to the holders of Notes if an examiner were to be appointed in respect of the Issuer are as follows: (a) the potential for a scheme of arrangement to be approved involving the writing down of the debt owed by the Issuer to the holders of the Notes as secured by the Notes Collateral; 554 ----- (b) the potential for the examiner to seek to set aside any negative pledge in the Notes prohibiting the creation of security or the incurring of borrowings by the Issuer to enable the examiner to borrow to fund the Issuer during the protection period; and (c) in the event that a scheme of arrangement is not approved and the Issuer subsequently goes into liquidation, the examiner’s remuneration and expenses (including certain borrowings incurred by the examiner on behalf of the Issuer and approved by the relevant Irish court) will take priority over the moneys and liabilities which from time to time are or may become due, owing or payable by the Issuer to each of the secured creditors under the Notes or under any other secured obligations.",N/A,as_expected,2017,928
952_1,Offerings 2017.md,27,LEGAL MATTERS,27.1,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF GUARANTEES AND SECURITY AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS Irish Law,27.1.3,Preferred Creditors,"Under Irish law, upon an insolvency of an Irish company such as the Issuer, when applying the proceeds of assets subject to fixed security that may have been realised in the course of a liquidation or receivership, the claims of a limited category of preferential creditors will take priority over the claims of creditors holding the relevant fixed security. These preferred claims include the remuneration, costs and expenses properly incurred by any examiner of the company (that may include any borrowings made by an examiner to fund the company’s requirements for the duration of his appointment) that have been approved by the Irish courts. See “Examinership” above. The holder of a fixed security over the book debts of an Irish incorporated company (that would include the Issuer) may be required by the Irish Revenue Commissioners, by notice in writing from the Irish Revenue Commissioners, to pay to them sums equivalent to those that the holder received in payment of debts due to it by the company. Where notice has been given to the Irish Revenue Commissioners of the creation of the security within 21 calendar days of its creation by the holder of the security, the holder’s liability is limited to the amount of certain outstanding Irish tax liabilities of the company (including liabilities in respect of VAT) arising after the issuance of the Irish Revenue Commissioners’ notice to the holder of fixed security. The Irish Revenue Commissioners may also attach any debt due to an Irish tax resident company by another person in order to discharge any liabilities of the company in respect of outstanding tax, whether the liabilities are due on its own account or as an agent or trustee. The scope of this right of the Irish Revenue Commissioners has not yet been considered by the Irish courts and it may override the rights of holders of security (whether fixed or floating) over the debt in question. In relation to the disposal of assets of any Irish tax resident company that are subject to security, a person entitled to the benefit of the security may be liable for tax in relation to any capital gains made by the company on a disposal of those assets on exercise of the security. The essence of a fixed charge is that the chargor does not have liberty to deal with the assets that are the subject matter of the security in the sense of disposing of such assets or expending or appropriating the moneys or claims constituting such assets and accordingly, if and to the extent that such liberty is given to the Issuer, any charge constituted by the Notes Collateral may operate as a floating, rather than a fixed charge. In particular, the Irish courts have held that in order to create a fixed charge on receivables, it is necessary to oblige the chargor to pay the proceeds of collection of the receivables into a designated bank account and to prohibit the chargor from withdrawing or otherwise dealing with the moneys standing to the credit of such account without the consent of the chargee. Depending upon the level of control actually exercised by the chargor, there is therefore a possibility that the fixed security purported to be created by the Notes Collateral would be regarded by the Irish courts as a floating charge. Floating charges have certain weaknesses, including the following: (a) they have weak priority against purchasers (who are not on notice of any negative pledge contained in the floating charge) and the chargees of the assets concerned and against lien holders, execution creditors and creditors with rights of set-off; 555 ----- (b) as discussed above, they rank after certain preferential creditors, such as claims of employees and certain taxes on winding-up; (c) they rank after certain insolvency remuneration expenses and liabilities; (d) the examiner of a company has certain rights to deal with the property covered by the floating charge; and (e) they rank after fixed charges.",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

The EC Regulation No. 2015/848 on Insolvency Proceedings (the “Recast Insolvency Regulation”) applies to insolvencies which commence after 26 June 2017 (subject to certain exceptions). Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the court which shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the EU member state (other than Denmark) where the company concerned has its “center of main interests” (“COMI”). The determination of where any such company has its COMI is a question of fact on which the courts of the different EU member states may have differing and conflicting views. The term COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which court has the competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition. In the case of a company or legal person, the COMI is presumed to be located in the country of the registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. That presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another EU member state within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Specifically, the presumption of the COMI being at the place of the registered office should be rebuttable if the company’s central administration is located in an EU member state other than the one where it has its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision of its interests, is located in that other EU member state. If the COMI of a company, at the time an insolvency application is made, is located in an EU member state (other than Denmark), only the courts of that EU member state have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings in respect of that company under the Recast Insolvency Regulation. The types of insolvency proceedings which may be opened as main proceedings in the relevant jurisdiction are listed in Annex A to the Recast Insolvency Regulation. Pursuant to Article 3(2) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, if the COMI of a company is in one EU member state (other than Denmark), the courts of another EU member state (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open secondary and territorial (sometimes referred to as “synthetic”) insolvency proceedings against that company only if such company has an “establishment” in the territory of such other EU member state. Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the Recast Insolvency Regulation and for the avoidance of doubt, are not limited to winding-up proceedings. Territorial proceedings are, in effect, secondary proceedings which are commenced prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings and which will usually convert to secondary proceedings on the opening of the main proceedings. An “establishment” is defined to mean any place of operations where the company carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. The effects of those insolvency proceedings opened in that other EU member state are restricted to the assets of the company which are situated in such other EU member state. Pursuant to Article 3(4) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, where main proceedings in the EU member state in which the company has its COMI have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can only be opened in another EU member state where the company has an establishment and either: (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the EU member state in which the company’s COMI is situated under that EU member state’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of a creditor whose claim arises from the operation of the establishment or a public authority requests the opening of such proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, 556 ----- such proceedings will, subject to certain exemptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus; that is, the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction for the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. The courts of all EU member states (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court opening main proceedings and give the same effect to the order in the other relevant EU member state so long as no secondary proceedings have been opened there. Pursuant to Article 21, the insolvency officeholder appointed by the court of the main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that EU member state in another EU member state (such as to remove assets of the company from that other EU member state), subject to certain limitations, so long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other EU member state or any preservation measure has been taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other EU member state where the company has assets. In order to avoid the opening of secondary proceedings, the insolvency practitioner in the main proceedings also may give a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the member state in which secondary proceedings could be opened, that when distributing assets or realization proceeds, it will comply with the distribution and priority rights under the national law that creditors would have if secondary proceedings were opened in that member state. This however is subject to a “qualified majority” (as defined under local law) of known local creditors approving the undertaking. The law applicable to the distribution of proceeds and ranking of claims is also the law of the state where secondary proceedings are opened. In addition, the concept of “group proceedings” has been introduced in the Recast Insolvency Regulation with the aim of bolstering communication and efficiency in the insolvency of several members of a group of companies. Under Article 61, group coordination proceedings may be requested before any court having jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of a member of the group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in insolvency proceedings opened in relation to a member of the group. Participation in group proceedings and adherence to the coordinating insolvency practitioner’s recommendations or plan however is voluntary.

On the basis of these factors, an English court may conclude that the U.K. Proceeds",27.4.1,Overview of English Insolvency Proceedings,"English insolvency law is different from the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. In the event that a U.K. Proceeds Loan Obligors experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways, including by the company or a creditor making an application to the court for entry into administration, the company or the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” (discussed below) entering into administration or appointing administrators through an out of court procedure (respectively), or by a creditor filing a petition to wind up the company or the company resolving to do so (in the case of liquidation). A company may be wound up if it is unable to pay its debts, and may be placed into administration if it is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts, and the administration is reasonably likely to achieve one of three statutory purposes. Under the Insolvency Act 1986, as amended (the “UK Insolvency Act”), a company is insolvent if it is unable to pay its debts. A company is deemed unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (unable to pay 557 ----- its debts as they fall due), if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities), or, among other matters, if it fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 or to satisfy in full a judgment debt (or similar court order). English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of a Proceeds Loan Guarantee against the relevant guarantor. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to certain limitations on the English guarantees. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights under the English guarantees and/or the security securing the Notes and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of the relevant guarantor. _Liquidation_ Liquidation is a proceeding where the relevant company’s assets are sold, the proceeds distributed to creditors (see “Priority of Claims in an English Insolvency Proceeding” below) and the company dissolved. There are two forms of winding-up: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court; and (b) voluntary liquidation, by resolution of the company’s members. The primary ground for the compulsory winding-up of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the UK Insolvency Act). A creditor’s voluntary liquidation (other than as an exit from administration) is initiated by a resolution of the members, not the creditors, but once in place is subject to some degree of control by the creditors. The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary winding-up. In a compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the UK Insolvency Act, any disposition of the relevant company’s property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void (see “Dispositions in Winding-up” below). Once a winding-up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed. No legal action may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the court. In the context of a voluntary winding-up however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the UK Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding-up—it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or shareholder of the company, to apply for a stay. This is important because it means secured creditors for example can go ahead and enforce their security. _Priority of Claims in an English Insolvency Proceeding_ With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined below), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class. The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority): - First ranking: holders of fixed charge security but only to the extent the value of the secured assets covers that indebtedness; - Second ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which expenses are paid); - Third ranking: preferential creditors. Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; (c) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the date of insolvency; and (d) bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”) up to the statutory limit. As between one another, ordinary preferential debts rank equally. Secondary preferential debts include bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS to the extent that claims exceed the statutory limit, and rank for payment after the discharge of the ordinary preferential debts.; 558 ----- - Fourth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security. This would include any floating charge that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which, on a proper interpretation, was rendered a floating charge. However, before distributing asset realizations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part must, subject to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors; - Fifth ranking: - firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and any secured creditor to the extent of any unsecured shortfall, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay the secured creditors any unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets, as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors; - secondly, interest on the company’s debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the official rate) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation, or after the commencement of any administration which had been converted into a distributing administration. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the Notes, such interest due to the holders of the Notes may, if there are sufficient realizations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; and - thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid. This however does not include “currency conversion” claims following the English Supreme Court Lehman _Brothers ruling dated 17 May 2017; and_ - Sixth ranking: shareholders. if after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company. Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the subordination language in the relevant documentation. An insolvency practitioner of the company (e.g. administrator, administrative receiver or liquidator) will generally be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors (after making full provision for preferential creditors and expenses out of floating charge realisations) (the “Prescribed Part”). Under current law, this ring-fence applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of floating charge realisations and 20% of the remainder over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £600,000. The Prescribed Part must be made available to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors. _Administration_ Administration is an insolvency procedure under the UK Insolvency Act, pursuant to which a company may be reorganized or its assets realized under the protection of a statutory moratorium. A company may be put into administration either pursuant to a court order or via an out-of-court process. Broadly speaking (and subject to specific conditions), a company can be placed into administration at the application of, among others, itself, its directors or one or more of its creditors (including contingent and prospective creditors). A holder of a qualifying floating charge over the assets of the company also has the right to appoint an administrator. Different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointor. In addition, a qualifying floating charge holder has the right to intervene in an administration application by nominating an alternative administrator or, in certain very specific circumstances, by blocking the appointment altogether by the appointment of an administrative receiver. The essential characteristics of a qualifying floating charge are that: (a) the charge must by its terms give the holder power to appoint an administrator (or administrative receiver); and (b) the charge (or that and other charges taken together) must relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the relevant company’s property. Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, an administrator may be appointed (either by a court or via the out-of-court process) if (which varies depending on the method of appointment): (a) the company proposed to 559 ----- be the subject of the order is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts”; and (b) the administration is reasonably likely to achieve one of the statutory objectives of administration. Administration proceedings are supposed to achieve one of three objectives that must be considered successively: rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than if the company went into immediate liquidation or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable, and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to secured or preferential creditors. The order of priority which applies to any distribution to creditors is set out above (see “Priority of Claims in an English Insolvency Proceeding” above). Broadly speaking, an interim moratorium comes into effect when an application for an administration order (in the case of a court appointment) or a notice of intention to appoint an administrator is made. At the commencement of the appointment of an administrator, a full statutory moratorium applies, pursuant to which creditors cannot take action against the relevant company, including, among other things, commencing a legal process against the company, winding up the relevant company or enforcing security or repossessing goods in the relevant company’s possession under a hire purchase agreement without the consent of the administrator or permission of the court. The same requirements for consent or permission apply to the institution or continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress and diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will consider discretionary factors in determining any application for leave in light of the hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration described above. Certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain defined circumstances, be able to realize their security over that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003. If a U.K. Proceeds Loan Obligors were to enter administration, it is possible that the security granted by it or the guarantee granted by it may not be enforced while it is in administration, without leave of the court or consent of the administrator. Claims of creditors may be submitted to the administrator, although court approval generally will be required before he can make a distribution to unsecured creditors. Time limits may be set for receipt and processing of claims before interim dividends are paid. _Administrative receivership_ If a company grants a “qualifying floating charge” to a party for the purposes of English insolvency law, that party will be able to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator out of court and, in the case of the ability to appoint an administrative receiver, the qualifying floating charge must, unless the security document pre-dates September 15, 2003, fall within one of the exceptions under the UK Insolvency Act as amended by the Enterprise Act 2002 to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers. In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which: (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it; (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company; or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the UK Insolvency Act. A party will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with other forms of security, relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the property of the relevant company and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the UK Insolvency Act), which may apply if the issue of the Notes creates a debt of at least £50.0 million for the relevant English company during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital market investment” (which is defined in the UK Insolvency Act, and includes rated, listed or traded debt instruments, and debt instruments designed to be rated, listed or traded). If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is invalid. If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office, and any receiver of part of the company’s property must resign if required to do so by the administrator. 560 ----- _Small Companies Moratorium_ Certain “small companies” for the purposes of putting together proposals for a company voluntary arrangement may seek court protection from their creditors by way of a “moratorium” for a period of up to 28 days, with the option for creditors to extend this protection for up to a further two months (although the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform may, by order, extend or reduce the duration of either period). A “small company” is defined for these purposes by reference to whether the relevant company meets certain tests relating to a company’s balance sheet, total turnover and average number of employees in a particular period (although the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform may, by order, modify the moratorium eligibility qualifications and the definition of a “small company”). During the period for which a moratorium is in force in relation to a company, among other things, no winding up may be commenced (except in very limited circumstances, for example where the UK Secretary of State considers it to be in the public interest to do so) or administrator or administrative receiver appointed to that company, no security created by that company over its property may be enforced (except with the leave of the Court or in the case of existence of financial collateral arrangements as defined in the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No 2) Regulations 2003 whereby the requirement to get a court order before enforcing security over small companies will not apply), no other proceedings or legal process may be commenced or continued to that company (except with the leave of the Court) and the relevant company’s ability to make payments in respect of debts and liabilities existing at the date of the filing for the moratorium is curtailed. In addition, if the holder of security created by that company (other than financial collateral as above described) consents or if the Court gives leave, it may dispose of the secured property as if it were not subject to the security. Where the property in question is subject to a security which was created as a floating charge, the chargee will have the same priority in respect of any property of the relevant company directly or indirectly representing the property disposed of as he would have had in respect of the property subject to the security. Where the security in question is other than a floating charge, it shall be a condition of the chargee’s consent or the leave of the Court that the net proceeds of the disposal shall be applied towards discharging the sums secured by the security. Certain small companies may, however, be excluded from being eligible for a moratorium (although the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform may, by regulations, modify such exclusions). As the law currently stands, companies that on the date of filing are party to an agreement which is or forms part of a capital market arrangement are excluded from being eligible for this small companies’ moratorium. _Possible challenges_ Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of a company has certain powers to apply to the court to challenge transactions entered into by a company if the company is unable to pay its debts (as defined in the UK Insolvency Act) at the time of the transaction or if the company becomes unable to pay its debts as a result of the transaction (see above for a description of when a company may be deemed unable to pay its debts). _Transactions at an undervalue_ A transaction might be challenged as a transaction at an undervalue if it involved the relevant company making a gift or otherwise entering into a transaction on terms under which it received no consideration, or the company received significantly less value than it gave in return. The court has powers to make any order it thinks fit in order to restore the position to what it would have been had the company not entered into that transaction. A court should not intervene, however, if it is satisfied that the relevant company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purposes of carrying on its business and if, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing that the transaction would benefit the company. The court can set aside transactions at an undervalue entered into by the company within a period of two years ending with the onset of insolvency (please see below for details of when the onset of insolvency occurs). The order could include reducing payments under the guarantees or setting aside any security interests or guarantees although there is protection for a third party that acquires an interest in property or benefits from the transaction and has acted in good faith for value without notice of the relevant circumstances). In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate 561 ----- that the English company was unable to pay its debts unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (see “Connected Persons” below), in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate the solvency of the English company in such proceedings. _Preferences_ A transaction might also be challenged as a preference where the relevant company has done something or suffered something to be done which has the effect of putting a creditor, surety or guarantor in a better position than he would have been in in the event of the relevant company going into insolvent liquidation. However, for the court to determine a preference, it must be shown that the English company was influenced by a desire to produce that result. If a transaction is found to have given a preference to a creditor, surety or guarantor of the company then the court may make such order as it thinks fit for restoring the position to what it would have been if the company had not given that preference (which could include reducing payments under the guarantees or setting aside any security interests or guarantees although there is protection in specific circumstances for a third party that acquires an interest in property or benefits from the transaction and has acted in good faith for value without notice of the relevant circumstances). In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English company was unable to pay its debts at the relevant time and that there was such desire to prefer the relevant creditor, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person, in which case it is presumed that the company intended to put that person in a better position and the connected person must demonstrate that there was, in fact, no such desire, on the part of the company, to prefer them. If the preference is given to a person connected to the company (other than an employee), the court looks back and sets aside those preferences entered into in the period of two years ending with the date of the onset of the company’s insolvency. If the person is not connected to the company, the court can only go back and set aside those preferences entered into in the period of six months ending on the onset of insolvency. _Transactions defrauding creditors_ Under English insolvency law, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue and was made for the purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a claim against a company, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim which that person is making or may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors. This provision may be used by any person who claims to be a “victim” of the transaction (with the leave of the court if the company is in liquidation or administration) and is not therefore limited to liquidators or administrators and, subject to certain conditions, the UK Financial Conduct Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator. There is no statutory time limit under English insolvency legislation within which the challenge must be made (subject to the normal statutory limitation periods) and the relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time of, or as a result of, the transaction. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not he is the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the debtor company in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, and will not require a person who received a benefit from such transaction to pay any sum unless such person was a party to the transaction. _Extortionate Credit Transactions_ Furthermore, an administrator or a liquidator can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. The court can review extortionate credit transactions entered into by a company up to three years before the day on which the company entered into administration or went into liquidation. A transaction is “extortionate” if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the terms of it are (or were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly contravened ordinary principles of fair dealing. If a transaction entered into by a company is found to be an extortionate credit transaction the court can make one or 562 ----- more orders specified in the UK Insolvency Act, including an order setting aside the whole or any part of any obligation created by the extortionate credit transaction, an order varying the terms of the extortionate credit transaction or the terms on which any security for the extortionate credit transaction is held, or an order requiring any person to pay to the administrator or liquidator any sums paid to that person, by virtue of the extortionate credit transaction, by the relevant company. _Avoidance of floating charges_ The UK Insolvency Act provides that, in certain circumstances, a floating charge granted by a company during the “relevant time” may be invalid in whole or in part if certain conditions are met. In the case of a floating charge which is created in favor of a person that is not connected to the company, the relevant time is deemed to be the period of 12 months ending with the onset of insolvency and at the time the charge was granted the company must have been unable to pay its debts or have become unable to pay its debts as a result of the transaction in respect of which the floating charge was granted. If the floating charge is created in favor of a person connected to the company, the relevant time is a period of two years ending with the onset of insolvency. However, if the floating charge qualifies as a “security financial collateral agreement” under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended), the floating charge will not be subject to challenge as described in this paragraph. An administrator, or a liquidator (as applicable), does not need to apply to court for an order declaring that a floating charge is invalid. Any floating charge created during the relevant time period is automatically invalid except to the extent of the value of any money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt owed by, the relevant company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge (plus certain interest), whether or not (in the case of a floating charge granted in favour of a person connected to the company only) the relevant company is unable to pay its debts at the time of grant or becomes unable to pay its debts as a consequence of the transaction under which the charge was created. As a result of the rights to challenge described above, in the event that a U.K. Proceeds Loan Obligor becomes unable to pay its debts within a period of up to two years of the funding of the Proceeds Loan (or three years if the Proceeds Loan or any related transaction are found to be an extortionate credit transaction), an administrator or liquidator is appointed and the conditions contemplated in the relevant legal provisions are met, the provision of the relevant guarantees may be challenged by a liquidator or administrator or a court may set aside the granting of the guarantees as invalid. _Connected Persons_ If the given transaction at an undervalue, preference, or invalid floating charge has been entered into by the company with a “connected person”, then particular specified time periods and presumptions will apply to any challenge by an administrator or liquidator. A connected person for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid floating charges, is a party who is a director, shadow director, an associate of such director, or an associate, of the relevant company. A person is associated with an individual if he/she is: (i) the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner; (ii) they are a relative of the individual; or (iii) the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner, or the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual or of a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner. A person is associated with a company if employed by that company. A company is associated with another company if the same person has control of both companies, or a person has control of one and persons who are his associates, or he and persons who are his associates, have control of the other, or if a group of two or more persons has control of each company, and the groups either consist of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member of either group as replaced by a person of whom he is an associate. _Onset of Insolvency_ The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid floating charges, depends on the insolvency procedure in question. In administration the onset of insolvency is the date on which: (a) the court application for an administration order is issued; (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court; or (c) otherwise, the date on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect. In a compulsory liquidation the onset of insolvency is the date on which the winding- up petition is 563 ----- presented to court, whereas in a voluntary liquidation it is the date on which the company passes a winding-up resolution. Where liquidation follows administration, the onset of insolvency will be the same as the initial administration. _Recharacterization of fixed security interests_ There is a possibility that a court could find that the fixed security interests expressed to be created by the security documents governed by English law could take effect as floating charges as the description given to them as fixed charges is not determinative. Where the SPV Share Trustee or the Issuer is free to deal with the secured assets without the consent of the chargee, the court would be likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge. Whether the fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will depend, among other things, on whether the security agent has the requisite degree of control over the SPV Share Trustee’s or the Issuer’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the security agent in practice. If the fixed security interests are recharacterized as floating security interests, the claims of: (i) the unsecured creditors of the SPV Share Trustee or the Issuer in respect of that part of SPV Share Trustee’s or the Issuer’s net property which is ring-fenced (see explanation about the Prescribed Part above); and (ii) certain statutorily defined preferential creditors of the SPV Share Trustee or the Issuer may have priority over the rights of the security agent to the proceeds of enforcement of such security. In addition, as mentioned above, the expenses of a liquidation or administration would also rank ahead of the claims of the security agent as floating charge holder. It is also possible that any purported floating charge security may no longer relate to the whole or substantially the whole of property of the relevant company and therefore may not constitute a qualifying floating charge. _Limitation on enforcement_ The grant of a guarantee by any of the U.K. Proceeds Loan Obligor in respect of the obligations of another group company must satisfy certain legal requirements. More specifically, such a transaction must be allowed by the respective company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that the above do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with the U.K. Proceeds Loan Obligor in good faith, however the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for the U.K. Proceeds Loan Obligor in question by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in the way that he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the U.K. Proceeds Loan Obligors for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found to be abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. _Account banks’ right to set-off_ With respect to the charges over cash deposits (each an “Issuer Bank Account Charge”) granted by a the Issuer over certain of its bank accounts, the banks with which some of those accounts are held (each an “Account",N/A,as_expected,2017,928
952_1,Offerings 2017.md,27,LEGAL MATTERS,27.4,"Proceeds Loan Obligors”). On the basis of these factors, an English court may conclude that the U.K. Proceeds",27.4.2,,"Loan Obligors have their COMI within the meaning of the Recast Insolvency Regulation in England and therefore insolvency proceedings in England constituting “main insolvency proceedings” may be commenced in respect of a U.K. Proceeds Loan Obligor. The point at which this issue falls to be determined is at the time that the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened. In addition, the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006, which implement the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency in the Great Britain, provide that a foreign (i.e. non-European) court may have jurisdiction where any English company has a COMI in such foreign jurisdiction or where it has an “establishment”.",N/A,as_expected,2017,928
952_1,Offerings 2017.md,27,LEGAL MATTERS,27.5,Bank”) may hold a right at any time (whether prior to or following a crystallization event under the Issuer Bank,27.5.1,,"Account Charge) to exercise the rights of netting or set-off to which they are entitled under their cash pooling arrangements with the Issuer. As a result, and if the security granted over those accounts is merely floating (rather than a fixed) charge, the collateral constituted by those bank accounts will be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s netting and set-off rights with respect to the bank accounts charged under the relevant Issuer Bank Account Charge. Once the floating charge has crystallised and converted into a fixed charge (as it would on enforcement or the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the Issuer) and the Account Bank has been formally notified of that fact, the collateral will no longer be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s netting and set-off rights. 564 ----- _Dispositions in Winding-up_ Other than set out in this section, any disposition of a U.K. Proceeds Loan Obligor’s property made after a compulsory winding-up has commenced is, unless the court orders otherwise, void. The compulsory winding-up of a company is deemed to commence when a winding-up petition is presented by a creditor against the company, rather than the date on which that court makes the winding-up order (if any). A disposition made by a secured party as a result of the enforcement of security held by it after the presentation of a winding-up petition will not be void merely because a winding-up petition has already been presented; as such a disposition would be made by the secured party (or its nominee) and not by the company that is the subject of the winding-up petition. _Foreign Currency_ Where creditors of a U.K. Proceeds Loan Obligors are asked to submit formal proofs of claim for their debts, and the debt is payable in a currency other than pounds sterling (such as any debt arising under the Notes or any guarantee thereof) the office-holder will convert all foreign currency denominated proofs of debt into sterling at a single rate for each currency determined by the office-holder by reference to the exchange rates prevailing on the relevant date. If a creditor considers the rate to be unreasonable, they may apply to the court to challenge the rate. _Foreign Laws_ If, and to the extent that, an asset subject to security under a security document (or the obligor of any debt or any other right against any person, which debt or right constitutes all or part of the property or rights subject to that security) is located in any jurisdiction other than the U.K. or is not governed by English law, the validity and priority of that security may be affected by any applicable foreign laws. _Third Parties_ Security granted over debts from, or other rights against, third party (including contracts and insurance policies) may be subject to any rights of those third parties. _Foreign Currency_ An English court may interpret restrictively any provision purporting to allow the beneficiary of a guarantee or other suretyship to make a material amendment to the obligations to which the guarantee or suretyship relates without further reference to the guarantor or surety. _Company voluntary arrangements_ Pursuant to Part I of the UK Insolvency Act, a company (by its directors or its administrator or liquidator as applicable) may propose a company voluntary arrangement to the company’s shareholders and creditors which entails a compromise, or other arrangement, between the company and its creditors, typically a rescheduling or reducing of the company’s debts. Provided that the proposal is approved by the requisite majority of creditors by way of a decision procedure, it will bind all unsecured creditors who were entitled to vote on the proposal. A company voluntary arrangement cannot affect the right of a secured creditor to enforce its security, except with its consent. In order for the company voluntary arrangement proposal to be passed, it must be approved by at least 75% (by value) of the company’s creditors who respond in the decision procedure, and no more than 50% (by value) of unconnected creditors may vote against it. Secured debt cannot be voted in a company voluntary arrangement. However, a secured creditor may vote to the extent that it is undersecured. A secured creditor who proves in the company voluntary arrangement for the whole of its debt may be deemed to have given up its security. _Scheme of arrangement_ Although it is not an insolvency proceeding, pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006, the English courts have jurisdiction to sanction a scheme of arrangement that effects a compromise of a company’s liabilities between a company and its creditors (or any class of its creditors). A U.K. Proceeds Loan Obligor may be able to 565 ----- pursue a scheme in respect of its financial liabilities. In addition, a foreign guarantor which is liable to be wound up under the UK Insolvency Act and has a “sufficient connection” to England and Wales could also pursue a scheme. In practice, a foreign company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb has been found to be satisfied where, amongst other things, the company’s COMI is in England, the company’s finance documents are English law-governed, or the company’s finance documents have been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by English law. Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not any of the grounds of the second limb are satisfied in the present case. Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement at a hearing where the fairness and reasonableness of the scheme will be considered, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If a majority in number representing 75% or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class of creditors vote in favour of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approved thresholds contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has the discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or reject the scheme.",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

Upon the commencement of a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor such as the Issuer is prohibited by the automatic stay imposed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code from taking any act to obtain possession of, or exercise control over, property of the bankruptcy estate absent relief from such stay. The automatic stay in a bankruptcy case of one or more of the US Proceeds Loan Obligors could therefore prevent the Issuer from obtaining possession or exercising control over the collateral or commencing any action in an attempt to obtain possession or exercise control over the collateral. The automatic stay could be lifted or modified with bankruptcy court approval in certain circumstances, but parties may object to any creditor request to lift or modify the automatic stay, and the bankruptcy court could deny such a request.",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

This remains the case unless a Chapter 11 trustee is appointed or the Chapter 11 case is converted to a Chapter 7 liquidation under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Moreover, the U.S. Bankruptcy Code permits the debtor to continue to retain and use collateral even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection” of its interest in the debtor’s property. The term “adequate protection” is not defined in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, but it may include making periodic cash payments, providing an additional or replacement lien or granting other relief, in each case to the extent that the collateral decreases in value during the pendency of the bankruptcy case as a result of, among other things, the use, sale or lease of such collateral or the imposition of the automatic stay. The type of adequate protection provided to a secured creditor may vary according to circumstances. A U.S. bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor is not entitled to additional adequate protection for a diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the amount of the debt that it secures. Only the debtor in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy case may propose a Chapter 11 plan unless the debtor fails to file a plan within the first 120 days of the case or fails to solicit sufficient acceptances of its plan within the first 180 days of the case. The bankruptcy court may reduce or enlarge these periods. The 120-day period could be extended for up to 18 months after a Chapter 11 filing, while the 180-day period could be extended for up to 20 months after a Chapter 11 filing. During these “exclusive periods,” other parties such as secured creditors would be precluded from proposing or soliciting acceptances of their own Chapter 11 plans. In view of the automatic stay, the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection,” the exclusive periods, and the broad discretionary power of a U.S. bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict: - whether or when the Issuer could enforce its security interests; - the value of the collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition or at the time a Chapter 11 plan is proposed or confirmed; or - whether or to what extent the Issuer would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the collateral through the requirement of “adequate protection.”",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

A Chapter 11 plan provides for the comprehensive treatment of all claims asserted against the debtor and its property, and may provide for the readjustment or extinguishment of equity interests. Claims and interests may be classified by type. Only those classes of claims and interests impaired by the plan may vote to accept or reject such plan. Classes of claims and interests that are unimpaired are not entitled to vote on the plan, and are deemed to accept it. Classes of claims and interest that receive no distributions under the plan are not entitled to vote on the plan, and are deemed to reject it. A class of claims is deemed to accept the plan if more than one-half in number of claims holders and two-thirds in claims amount in that class vote in favor of the plan. A plan can be confirmed by the bankruptcy court over the dissenting votes of members of a class that accepts the plan overall. Furthermore, even if one or more impaired classes reject the plan, it may still be confirmed, subject to specific statutory requirements, in accordance with the “cram-down” provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, so long as the plan does not discriminate unfairly, and is fair and equitable, with respect to each class of claims or interests that is impaired under, and has not accepted, the plan.

There are two forms of winding-up: (i) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court; and (ii) voluntary liquidation, by resolution of the company’s members. The primary ground for the compulsory winding-up of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 93 of the Cayman Islands Companies Law (2016 Revision) (the “Companies Law”)). The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary winding-up. In a compulsory winding-up, under Section 99 of the Companies Law, any disposition of the relevant company’s property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced from the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition. Once a winding-up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed. No legal action may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the court. In the context of a voluntary winding-up however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a winding up order; the winding up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no equivalent of Section 99 of the Companies Law. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding-up. Neither a compulsory winding-up, nor a voluntary-winding-up, nor the appointment of provisional liquidators (as to which, see below) prevents a secured creditor from enforcing their security in accordance with its terms. 568 ----- Pursuant to section 142(1) of the Companies Law, notwithstanding that a winding up order has been made, a creditor who has security over part or whole of the assets of the company is entitled to enforce his security",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

However, a temporary stay in aid of a restructuring may sometimes be achieved in the Cayman Islands by the filing of a winding up petition and the appointment of provisional liquidators by the Court in circumstances where the purpose of the appointment is to allow the Company to come to a compromise or arrangement with its creditors. Separately, the appointment of provisional liquidators may also be available where there are grounds for a winding up petition, and there is also a need to prevent the dissipation or misuse of the company’s assets, to prevent oppression of take actions to safeguard the company’s assets from dissipation or mismanagement). The appointment of provisional liquidators can provide a company with a temporary stay to allow it to formulate and present such a compromise or arrangement. Section 96 of the Companies Law states that the Court may at any time after the presentation of a petition for winding up a company and before making a winding up order, restrain further proceedings in any action, suit or proceeding against the company upon such terms as the Court thinks fit. In addition, Section 97 of the Companies Law provides that when a winding up order is made or a provisional liquidator is appointed, no suit, action or other proceedings, including criminal proceedings, shall be proceeded with or commenced against the company except with the leave of the Court and subject to such terms as the Court may impose.

The general priority on insolvency is not set out in any one particular statute but can be gleaned across a number of statutes and is generally viewed to be as follows (in descending order of priority): - First ranking: holders of fixed charge security and creditors with a proprietary interest in assets in the possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor but only to the extent the value of the secured assets covers that indebtedness. The costs and expenses of any receiver appointed to realise the charged property may be paid by the appointing party or recovered out of the secured assets. Where the Court orders the sale of secured property, outstanding contributions to the company’s pension fund are deducted before the secured creditor is paid (section 65(3) of the National Pensions Law (2012 Revision). Claims by employees working in the Cayman Islands in respect of severance pay (section 40(2) of the Labour Law (2011 Revision) rank ahead of fixed charge holders.; - Second ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate section 109 of the Companies Law and Order 20 of the Companies Winding Up Rules 2008 (“Winding Up Rules”). ( set out the order of priority in which liquidation expenses are paid); - Third ranking: preferential creditors. Ordinary preferential debts relevantly include debts owed by the insolvent company to employees and certain taxes and fees due to the Cayman Islands Government. Preferential debts are governed by section 141 and Schedule 2 of the Companies Law. In addition, where the company holds an A class banking licence, subject to certain exceptions, depositors with deposits of CI$20,000 or less are preferred up to the value of their deposit. Taxes and fees due to the Cayman Islands Government will include fees due under the Companies Law and licence fees payable under regulatory laws (this includes fees payable to the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (“CIMA”) by regulated entities); 569 ----- - Fourth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security. This would include any floating charge that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which, on a proper interpretation, was rendered a floating charge. Where the Court orders the sale of secured property, outstanding contributions to the company’s pension fund are deducted before the secured creditor is paid (section 65(3) of the National Pensions Law (2012 Revision); - Fifth ranking: provable debts of unsecured creditors and any secured creditor to the extent of any unsecured shortfall, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant liquidation proceedings. These debts rank equally among themselves unless there are subordination agreements in place between any of them; - Sixth ranking: Subordinated creditors. This represents the likely position of creditors who have agreed that their claims will be subordinated. However, a creditor may contractually agree to be subordinated at any position below ordinary unsecured creditors in the payment waterfall. Where subordinated creditors rank will therefore turn on the terms of the subordination agreement; - Seventh ranking: Where the liquidation lasts for more than six months, post-liquidation interest (section 149 of the Companies Law and Order 16, Rule 12 of the Winding Up Rules. - Eighth ranking: non-provable liabilities, being a liability that does not fall within the definition of “provable debts” in section 139(1) of the Companies Law or is otherwise barred from the proof process (and which does not constitute a cost and expense of the liquidation). It is unclear whether non-provable liabilities exist as a matter of Cayman Islands law. As far as we are aware this issue has not arisen for consideration. However, if the guidance from English case law concerning non-provable liabilities were applied by the Cayman Islands Court it is theoretically possible that non-provable liabilities may arise in a Cayman Islands liquidation. - Ninth ranking: pursuant to section 49(g) of the Companies Law, any sums due to shareholders in their character as a member by way of dividend, profits or otherwise. - Tenth ranking: shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company. If the company has different classes of shares, the rights as between the shareholders of the company upon a liquidation will depend upon the terms of the company’s constitutional documents and any other agreements between the shareholders. Subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the subordination.",N/A,as_expected,2017,928
952_1,Offerings 2017.md,27,LEGAL MATTERS,27.7,Cayman Islands Insolvency Law,27.7.4,Reviewable Transactions,"There are two principal provisions of the Companies Law under which transactions entered into prior to a company’s insolvency are capable of being set aside. They are: (i) Avoidance of dispositions made at an undervalue (section 146 of the Companies Law and section 4 of the Fraudulent Dispositions Law); and (ii) preferences (section 145 of the Companies Law). In addition, as referred to above, under Section 99 of the Companies Law, any disposition of the relevant company’s property made after the commencement of the winding up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. These provisions all apply where a company has gone into a Cayman Islands liquidation. _Fraudulent Dispositions_ If a company goes into liquidation and it has entered into a disposition at an undervalue with the intent to defraud its creditors, the court may, on the application of the liquidator, set the disposition aside. A disposition will constitute a disposition at an undervalue if: the disposition is on terms that provide for the company to receive no consideration or a disposition for a consideration the value of which (in money or money’s worth) is significantly less than the value (in money or money’s worth) of the property which is the subject of the disposition). 570 ----- The liquidator must show that there was “intent to defraud” a creditor, meaning an intention to wilfully defeat an obligation owed to a creditor. Unlike preferences below, there is no requirement to show insolvency at the time of the disposition (however, it is unlikely that any creditors will be prejudiced by any such disposition unless the company is insolvent). Under section 4 of the Fraudulent Dispositions Law (1996 Revision), a disposition of property made with an intent to defraud (again defined as an intention of a transferor wilfully to defeat an obligation owed to a creditor) and at an undervalue is voidable at the instance of a creditor thereby prejudiced. An application to set aside a disposition must be made within six years of the date of the disposition. _Preferences_ If a company goes into liquidation and it has granted a preference the Court may, on the application of the liquidator, set the transaction aside. If within six months before the commencement of the winding up of a company, at a time when it cannot pay its debts as they fall due, the company makes a payment, or transfers or charges any of its property, or takes or suffers any judicial proceedings, in favour of any of its creditors with a view to giving that creditor a preference over the other creditors of the company, the payment, transfer, charge or judicial proceedings will be deemed a fraudulent preference and will be void. This is the effect of Section 145 of the Companies Law. The essence of a fraudulent preference is that the company, knowing that it cannot pay all its debts in full, voluntarily and improperly makes a payment or gives a benefit to one creditor which results in an inequality between him and its other creditors. A transaction will only be set aside as a fraudulent preference if the company’s act was undertaken voluntarily (as opposed to under the threat of legal proceedings), the company must intend to prefer the creditor (Cayman Islands Law imposes a subjective test), the company was insolvent at the time the payment was made, and the creditor obtained some benefit which he would not have received if the company had been wound up immediately. _Orders_ In the case of any of the above applying and where a court order is required, the court has very wide statutory powers to make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to that which existed before the transaction was entered into. _Common law remedies_ Depending on the circumstances, in addition to the above statutory provisions the Court may effectively reverse certain antecedent transactions based on common law and/or equitable principles. For example, in the event a transaction amounts to a breach of the directors’ fiduciary duties, and if a person knowingly receives the company’s property as a result of that breach in circumstances where it would be unconscionable for them to retain the property, the Court may order that this property be held on constructive trust for the company. The application of these principles can be complex and highly fact-sensitive.",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

Whether the purported fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will depend, among other things, on whether the secured party has the requisite degree of control over the chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the security holder in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported fixed charge in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee, the court would be likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge. If any fixed security interests are recharacterized as floating security interests, the proceeds of those assets could be applied in meeting other liabilities of the company in priority to the claims of the purported fixed charge holder in insolvency proceedings. 571 -----",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

The telephone cable is effectively divided into three bands: the downstream band from the service provider to the end customer; the upstream band from the end customer to the service provider; and a voice band through which (using a splitter) telephone calls (analog or via ISDN) can be made. “Analog” Comes from the word “analogous” which means “similar to” in telephone transmission, the signal being transmitted (voice, video or image) is “analogous” to the original signal. “ARPU” Average revenue per user. “B2B” Business-to business services. “Backbone” A backbone refers to the principal data routes, between large, interconnected networks or within a large operator’s network. “bandwidth” The width of a communications channel; in other words, the difference between the highest and lowest frequencies available for network signals. Bandwidth also refers to the capacity to move information. “broadband” Any circuit that can transfer data significantly faster than a dial up phone line. “Bundle/bundling” Bundling is a marketing strategy that involves offering several products for sale as one combined product. “Digital” The use of a binary code to represent information in telecommunications recording and computing. Analog signals, such as voice or music, are encoded digitally by sampling the voice or music analog signals many times a second and assigning a number to each sample. Recording or transmitting information digitally has two major benefits: First, digital signals can be reproduced more precisely so digital transmission is “cleaner” than analog transmission and the electronic circuitry necessary to handle digital is becoming cheaper and more powerful; and second, digital signals require less transmission capacity than analog signals. “DOCSIS” Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS) is an international standard that defines the communications and operation support interface requirements for a data over cable system. It permits the addition of high-speed data transfer to an existing cable TV system. Cable companies use the DOCSIS standard to improve speeds they can offer. The DOCSIS 3.0 broadband technology allows speed levels of 200 Mbps and beyond. “DSL” Digital Subscriber Line is a generic name for a range of digital technologies relating to the transmission of internet and data signals from the telecommunications service provider’s central office to the end customer’s premises over the standard copper wire used for voice services. “DTH” Direct-to-home, which refers to satellite television broadcasts intended for home reception. “DTT” Digital terrestrial television. “DVR” Digital video recorder is a device that allows end users to digitally record television programming for later playback. “Free-to-air (FTA)” Transmission of content for which television viewers are not required to pay a fee for receiving transmissions. “FTTH” Fiber-to-the-home.

These networks all use the IP (Internet Protocol) communications protocol. “IP” Internet Protocol is a protocol used for communicating data across a packet-switched network. It is used for transmitting data over the internet and other similar networks. The data is broken down into data packets, each data packet is assigned an individual address, then the data packets are transmitted independently and finally reassembled at the destination. “IPTV” Internet Protocol Television is the transmission of television content using IP over a network infrastructure, such as a broadband connection. “IRU” Indefeasible rights of use. “ISP” Internet service provider. “LNP” Local number portability. “Local loop The local loop is the physical link between the first demarcation point of the infrastructure” customer’s premises and the delivery point into the network of the provider renting the local loop.

Transmission links may be based on fiber optic or metallic cable or point to point radio connections. “OTT” refers to over-the-top content and means the delivery of audio, video, messages and other media over the internet without the involvement of a telecommunications operator in the content or distribution of the content. “quad play” Offering of digital television, broadband internet, telephony and mobile services packaged in a bundle. “RGU” Revenue Generating Unit. “SIM” An active subscriber identification module. “SMS” Short message service. G-2 ----- “Tb/s” terabytes per second; a unit of data transfer rate that is equal to 10[12], or approximately a trillion bytes. “Tbit/s” terabits per second; a unit of data transfer rate that is equal to 10[12], or approximately a trillion bits. “triple play” Offering of digital television, broadband internet and telephony services packaged in a bundle. “Unbundled local The twisted-pair connection between the local exchange and the home. loop” “VDSL” Very high bit rate DSL, a DSL technology that provides a faster data transfer rate than asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) and ADSL2+ technologies. In most occasions VDSL2 technology is used, which extends the capacity of the underlying VDSL system by further utilizing the frequency spectrum and extending transfer speeds for the downstream band to up to 50 Mbps. “Vectoring” Also known as VDSL2 vectoring, a transmission method that employs the coordination of line signals for reduction of crosstalk levels and improvement of performance, extending transfer speeds for the downstream band to up to 100 Mbps. “VoD” Video on demand; a service which provides subscribers with enhanced playback functionality and gives subscribers access to a broad array of on demand programming, including movies, live events, local drama, music videos, kids programming and adult programming. “VoIP” Voice over Internet Protocol; a telephone service via internet, or via TCP/IP protocol, which can be accessed using a computer, a sound card, adequate software and a modem.

We also continued to grow our DTH[31] base, adding 3,000 RGUs in Q2. On the mobile front, we lost 16,000 low-ARPU prepaid subscribers in the quarter - In Jamaica, RGUs decreased by 12,000 in Q2 as subscribers declined across all fixed-line categories. Our mobile base grew by 3,000 subscribers as we continued to target increased market share - In the Bahamas, we reported a small RGU decline of 1,000 in Q2 as continued penetration of our growing Fiber-to-the-Home (FttH) network generated 2,000 video adds, offset by a decline of 3,000 in voice subscribers. Our mobile subscriber base fell by 24,000 following the entry of a new competitor into the market in late 2016 - In Barbados, RGUs declined by 4,000, primarily due to lower fixed-line telephony subscribers and, to a lesser extent, declines in video and broadband caused by competition - In Trinidad, we added 2,000 RGUs as growth in fixed-line telephony, through bundling promotions, more than offset a decline in video subscribers due to continued competitive intensity C-2 -----",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

Our rebased growth rates reflect the impact of including the Carve-out Entities[36] in the prior-year periods - Mobile revenue declined by 2% as 26% rebased growth in Jamaica was more than offset by an 18% decline in the Bahamas following the entry of a new competitor and reduced roaming rates year-over-year. In Panama, our largest mobile market, mobile revenue declined by 1% compared to the prior year, however mobile revenue was up 1% sequentially following the launch of new bundled offers to encourage voice and data usage - Internet revenue was up 3% year-over-year, as subscriber growth in Panama drove revenue expansion, while price increases in Jamaica boosted that operations’ revenue. These factors were partly offset by internet revenue declines in Barbados from subscriber losses - Video revenue was 1% lower in Q2 primarily due to a decline in Trinidad, our largest video market, where we are working to stabilize our business in a challenging competitive and macroeconomic environment. These efforts generated some success in Q2, as the launch of refreshed bundles resulted in flat sequential video revenue in Trinidad - Fixed-line telephony revenue was down 3% in the quarter, driven by a decline in subscribers across our footprint over the past year - Managed services revenue grew 5%, as recurring revenue growth across the group was partly offset by a 7% decline in Panama, driven by a decline in low-margin equipment-related revenue - Wholesale revenue, primarily representing our sub-sea business, was up 12% in Q2 on a rebased basis compared to the prior-year period. During Q2, we recognized $6 million on a cash basis, primarily related to services provided in prior quarters to a significant customer. Revenue recognized on a cash basis for this customer in Q1 2017 was $4 million - Net loss was $14 million in Q2, as compared to a net loss of $105 million in the prior-year quarter - The decreased net loss represents the net impact of higher Adjusted Segment EBITDA, as described below, lower direct acquisition costs, reduced losses on debt extinguishment and a gain on derivatives, partly offset by increases in depreciation and amortization expenses and the impact of legal provision releases in Q2 2016 - Adjusted Segment EBITDA was up 8%, on a rebased basis, in Q2, as compared to the prior-year period - Rebased growth was driven by (i) an increased gross margin contribution from our managed services business, boosted by an improved mix of services in Q2 2017, (ii) the aggregate favorable impact of higher integration costs and higher bad debts in Q2 2016, and (iii) reductions in other costs, including consultancy, travel and office expenses. These factors were partially offset by higher content costs, primarily related to the Premier League rights - Our portion of Adjusted Segment EBITDA, after deducting the non-controlling interests’ share, (“Proportionate Adjusted Segment EBITDA”)[37] was $169 million for Q2 2017 - Property, equipment and intangible asset additions represented 17% of revenue in Q2 versus 21% in the prior-year period - The majority of spend in our Q2 related to CPE and network expansion activity with a total of ~30,000 two-way homes newly passed or upgraded in Q2 - Property and equipment additions are expected to increase in the second half of the year. However, based in part on our lower YTD spend, we are lowering our full-year 2017 expectation of property, equipment and intangible asset additions as a percentage of revenue from a range of 21% to 23% to a range of 18% to 20% C-3 ----- - At June 30, 2017, our total net debt[37] was $3.4 billion, our Proportionate Net Debt[37] was $3.2 billion, our fully-swapped third-party debt borrowing cost[13] was 6.6%, and the average tenor of our third-party debt was five years - Based on Q2 2017 results, our Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio[38] was 4.18x. At June 30, 2017, we had maximum undrawn commitments of $742 million, including $117 million under our regional facilities. When our compliance reporting requirements have been completed and assuming no changes from June 30, 2017 borrowing levels, other than (i) a $50 million drawdown on our revolving credit facility to fund part of the contribution to the CWSF as described below and (ii) the removal of letters of credit issued in connection with pension fund obligations, we anticipate that availability under our revolving credit facilities (including regional facilities) will be limited to $692 million - On July 25, 2017, Cable & Wireless (Barbados) Limited (“Cable & Wireless Barbados”), announced a recommended offer by Cable and Wireless (West Indies) Limited (“CWWI”) to acquire all issued and outstanding common shares of Cable & Wireless Barbados not already owned by CWWI by way of an amalgamation under Barbados law for BBD$2.86 in cash per share, or an aggregate of approximately BBD$77 million ($38 million). CWWI is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of CWC that currently owns approximately 81% of the issued and outstanding common shares of Cable & Wireless Barbados. The proposed transaction is subject to the approval of two-thirds of the votes cast by the Cable & Wireless Barbados shareholders at a special meeting, scheduled for August 24, 2017. CWWI intends to vote its shares in support thereof, with expected completion at the end of August or beginning of September 2017. It is anticipated that the consideration will be paid for using funds currently available at Cable & Wireless Barbados - The Liberty Global Transaction constituted a “change of control” under a contingent funding agreement (the “Contingent Funding Agreement”) between CWC and the trustee of the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund (“CWSF”). Under the terms of the Contingent Funding Agreement, the change in control provided the trustee of the CWSF with the right to satisfy certain funding requirements of the CWSF through the utilization of letters of credit aggregating £100 million that were put in place in connection with our acquisition of Columbus International Inc. in March 2015. On June 26, 2017, the trustee of the CWSF elected to drawdown the full £100 million ($130 million at the applicable exchange rate) available under the letters of credit, which amount was contributed to the CWSF on July 3, 2017 - Taking into account the £100 million contribution and based on the triennial valuation that was completed in July 2017, no funding deficit exists with respect to the CWSF. As a result, we do not expect to make material contributions to the CWSF through April 2019 - Prior to the outcome of the triennial valuation, our contributions necessary to fund the CWSF had been expected to range from nil to $28.4 million per year during 2017, 2018 and 2019 - In May 2017, CWC raised a new $1,125 million term loan facility (the CWC Term Loan B-3 Facility), which bears interest at a rate of LIBOR + 3.50% and matures in 2025. The proceeds were used to prepay the $1,100 million Term Loans due 2022, which bore interest at a rate of LIBOR + 4.75% - In July 2017, the commitments under the CWC Term Loan B-3 Facility were increased by $700 million. The proceeds will be used to partially redeem the 7.375% USD Unsecured Notes due 2021 - The financial figures contained in this release are prepared in accordance with IASB-IFRS[39]. CWC’s financial condition and results of operations are included in Liberty Global’s consolidated financial statements under U.S. GAAP[14].

(43,700) (4,500) (48,200) Footnotes 1 Omitted. 2 RGU is separately a Basic Video Subscriber, Enhanced Video Subscriber, DTH Subscriber, Internet Subscriber or Telephony Subscriber (each as defined and described below). A home, residential multiple dwelling unit, or commercial unit may contain one or more RGUs. For example, if a residential customer subscribed to our enhanced video service, fixed-line telephony service and broadband internet service, the customer would constitute three RGUs. Total RGUs is the sum of Basic Video, Enhanced Video, DTH, Internet and Telephony Subscribers. RGUs generally are counted on a unique premises basis such that a given premises does not count as more than one RGU for any given service. On the other hand, if an individual receives one of our services in two premises (e.g., a primary home and a vacation home), that individual will count as two RGUs for that service. Each bundled cable, internet or telephony service is counted as a separate RGU regardless of the nature of any bundling discount or promotion. Non-paying subscribers are counted as subscribers during their free promotional service period. Some of these subscribers may choose to disconnect after their free service period. Services offered without charge on a long-term basis (e.g., VIP subscribers or free service to employees) generally are not counted as RGUs. We do not include subscriptions to mobile services in our externally reported RGU counts. In this regard, our June 30, 2017 RGU counts exclude our separately reported postpaid and prepaid mobile subscribers. 3 Fixed-line Customer Relationships are the number of customers who receive at least one of our video, internet or telephony services that we count as Revenue Generating Units (“RGUs”), without regard to which or to how many services they subscribe. To the extent that RGU counts include equivalent billing unit (“EBU”) adjustments, we reflect corresponding adjustments to our Customer Relationship counts. For further information regarding our EBU calculation, see Additional General Notes below. Fixed-line Customer Relationships generally are counted on a unique premises basis. Accordingly, if an individual receives our services in two premises (e.g., a primary home and a vacation home), that individual generally will count as two Customer Relationships. We exclude mobile-only customers from Customer Relationships. 4 Omitted. 5 Internet Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives internet services over our networks, or that we service through a partner network (defined below). Our Internet Subscribers do not include customers that receive services from dial-up connections. 6 Our mobile subscriber count represents the number of active subscriber identification module (“SIM”) cards in service rather than services provided. For example, if a mobile subscriber has both a data and voice plan on a smartphone this would equate to one mobile subscriber. Alternatively, a subscriber who has a voice and data plan for a mobile handset and a data plan for a laptop (via a dongle) would be counted as two mobile subscribers. Customers who do not pay a recurring monthly fee are excluded from our mobile telephony subscriber counts after periods of inactivity ranging from 30 to 90 days, based on industry standards within the respective country. C-12 ----- 7 Omitted. 8 Average Revenue Per Unit (“ARPU”) refers to the average monthly subscription revenue (subscription revenue excludes interconnect, channel carriage fees, mobile handset sales, late fees and installation fees) per average customer relationship or mobile subscriber, as applicable. ARPU per average customer relationship is calculated by dividing the average monthly subscription revenue from residential cable and SOHO services by the average of the opening and closing balances for customer relationships for the period. ARPU per average mobile subscriber is calculated by dividing residential mobile and SOHO revenue for the indicated period by the average of the opening and closing balances for mobile subscribers for the period. Unless otherwise indicated, ARPU per customer relationship or mobile subscriber is not adjusted for currency impacts. ARPU per RGU refers to average monthly revenue per average RGU, which is calculated by dividing the average monthly subscription revenue from residential and SOHO services for the indicated period, by the average of the opening and closing balances of the applicable RGUs for the period. Unless otherwise noted, ARPU in this release is considered to be ARPU per average customer relationship or mobile subscriber, as applicable. Customer relationships, mobile subscribers and RGUs of entities acquired during the period are normalized. 9 Omitted. 10 Omitted. 11 Omitted. 12 Property, equipment and intangible asset additions include capital expenditures on an accrual basis, amounts financed under vendor financing or capital lease arrangements and other non-cash additions. 13 Our fully-swapped third-party debt borrowing cost represents the weighted average interest rate on our aggregate variable- and fixed-rate indebtedness (excluding capital leases and including vendor financing obligations), including the effects of derivative instruments, original issue premiums or discounts and commitment fees, but excluding the impact of financing costs. 14 Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States are referred to as U.S. GAAP. 15 Homes Passed are homes, residential multiple dwelling units or commercial units that can be connected to our networks without materially extending the distribution plant, except for DTH homes. Certain of our Homes Passed counts are based on census data that can change based on either revisions to the data or from new census results. We do not count homes passed for DTH. 16 Two-way Homes Passed are Homes Passed by those sections of our networks that are technologically capable of providing two-way services, including video, internet and telephony services. 17 Basic Video Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video service over our broadband network either via an analog video signal or via a digital video signal without subscribing to any recurring monthly service that requires the use of encryption-enabling technology. Encryption-enabling technology includes smart cards, or other integrated or virtual technologies that we use to provide our enhanced service offerings. With the exception of RGUs that we count on an EBU basis, we count RGUs on a unique premises basis. In other words, a subscriber with multiple outlets in one premises is counted as one RGU and a subscriber with two homes and a subscription to our video service at each home is counted as two RGUs. 18 Enhanced Video Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video service over our broadband network or through a partner network via a digital video signal while subscribing to any recurring monthly service that requires the use of encryption-enabling technology. Enhanced Video Subscribers that are not counted on an EBU basis are counted on a unique premises basis. For example, a subscriber with one or more set-top boxes that receives our video service in one premises is generally counted as just one subscriber. An Enhanced Video Subscriber is not counted as a Basic Video Subscriber. As we migrate customers from basic to enhanced video services, we report a decrease in our Basic Video Subscribers equal to the increase in our Enhanced Video Subscribers. 19 Telephony Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives voice services over our networks, or that we service through a partner network. Telephony Subscribers exclude mobile telephony subscribers. 20 Omitted. 21 Our ARPU per mobile subscriber calculation that excludes interconnect revenue refers to the average monthly mobile subscription revenue per average mobile subscriber in service and is calculated by dividing the average monthly mobile subscription revenue (excluding activation fees, handset sales and late fees) for the indicated period, by the average of the opening and closing balances of mobile subscribers in service for the period. Our ARPU per mobile subscriber calculation that includes interconnect revenue increases the numerator in the above-described calculation by the amount of mobile interconnect revenue during the period. 22 Omitted. 23 Omitted. 24 Omitted. C-13 ----- 25 Net third-party debt including capital or finance lease obligations (as applicable) is not a defined term under U.S. GAAP, EU-IFRS or IASB-IFRS and may not therefore be comparable with other similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 26 Omitted. 27 Adjusted Segment EBITDA is the primary measure used by our management to evaluate the company’s performance. Adjusted Segment EBITDA is also a key factor that is used by our internal decision makers to evaluate the effectiveness of our management for purposes of annual and other incentive compensation plans. We define EBITDA as earnings before net finance expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. As we use the term, Adjusted Segment EBITDA is defined as EBITDA before share-based compensation, provisions and provision releases related to significant litigation, impairment, restructuring and other operating items and related-party fees and allocations. Other operating items include (i) gains and losses on the disposition of long-lived assets, (ii) third-party costs directly associated with successful and unsuccessful acquisitions and dispositions, including legal, advisory and due diligence fees, as applicable, and (iii) other acquisition-related items, such as gains and losses on the settlement of contingent consideration. Our internal decision makers believe Adjusted Segment EBITDA is a meaningful measure because it represents a transparent view of our recurring operating performance that is unaffected by our capital structure and allows management to readily view operating trends and identify strategies to improve operating performance. We believe our Adjusted Segment EBITDA measure is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our performance with the performance of other companies in the same or similar industries, although our measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Adjusted Segment EBITDA should be viewed as a measure of operating performance that is a supplement to, and not a substitute for EBIT, net earnings (loss), cash flow from operating activities and other EU-IFRS or IASB-IFRS measures of income or cash flows. 28 Omitted. 29 Enhanced video penetration is calculated by dividing the number of enhanced video RGUs by the total number of basic and enhanced video RGUs. 30 Broadband and telephony penetration is calculated by dividing the number of telephony RGUs and broadband RGUs, respectively, by total Two-way Homes Passed. 31 DTH Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video programming broadcast directly via a geosynchronous satellite. 32 Omitted. 33 Omitted. 34 Omitted. C-14 ----- 35 For purposes of calculating rebased growth rates on a comparable basis for the CWC borrowing group, we have adjusted the historical revenue and Adjusted Segment EBITDA for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 to (i) reflect the impacts of the alignment to Liberty Global’s accounting policies, (ii) include the pre-acquisition revenue and Segment OCF of the Carve-out Entities for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 to the same extent that the revenue and Segment OCF of the Carve-out Entities, as defined below, are included in our results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and (iii) reflect the translation of our rebased amounts for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 at the applicable average foreign currency exchange rates that were used to translate CWC’s results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017. The most significant adjustments to conform to Liberty Global’s policies relate to the capitalization of certain installation activities that previously were expensed, the reflection of certain lease arrangements as capital leases that previously were accounted for as operating leases and the reflection of certain time-based licenses as operating expenses that previously were capitalized. We have not adjusted the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 to eliminate nonrecurring items or to give retroactive effect to any changes in estimates that have been implemented in the three and six months ended June 30, 2017. The adjustments reflected in our rebased amounts have not been prepared with a view towards complying with Article 11 of Regulation S-X. In addition, the rebased growth rates are not necessarily indicative of the rebased revenue and Adjusted Segment EBITDA that would have occurred if the acquisition of CWC had occurred on the date assumed for purposes of calculating our rebased amounts or the revenue and Adjusted Segment EBITDA that will occur in the future. The rebased growth percentages have been presented as a basis for assessing growth rates on a comparable basis, and are not presented as a measure of our pro forma financial performance. The following table provides adjustments made to the 2016 amounts to derive our rebased growth rates for CWC:",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

The arrangements with respect to the Carve-out Entities, which were executed in connection with our acquisition of CWC and the acquisition made by CWC in 2015, contemplated that upon receipt of regulatory approval, CWC would acquire the Carve-out Entities. On March 8, 2017, the FCC granted its approval for CWC’s acquisition of the Carve-out Entities. Accordingly, on April 1, 2017, subsidiaries of CWC acquired the Carve-out Entities for an aggregate purchase price of $86.2 million, which represents the amount due under notes receivable that were exchanged for the equity of the Carve-out Entities. 37 Total net debt is equal to the nominal amount outstanding of CWC’s consolidated third-party debt and finance lease obligations, less cash and cash equivalents. Proportionate Net Debt is equal to the total net third-party debt less the noncontrolling interests’ share of net thirdparty debt and Proportionate Adjusted Segment EBITDA is equal to Adjusted Segment EBITDA less the noncontrolling interests’ share of Adjusted Segment EBITDA. Our internal decision makers believe Proportionate Net Debt and Proportionate Adjusted Segment EBITDA are meaningful measures when assessing leverage of the company because each measure excludes the noncontrolling interests’ respective share of CWC’s total net debt and total Adjusted Segment EBITDA, respectively. These measures provide investors with a means to assess the relative leverage of CWC’s wholly-owned and non-wholly-owned operations on a basis that is consistent with CWC’s debt structure, in that most of CWC’s consolidated debt is not an obligation of CWC’s non-wholly-owned subsidiaries. Proportionate Adjusted Segment EBITDA is not intended to represent the cash that may be distributed to CWC by its non-wholly owned subsidiaries or that might be available to repay debt, nor is it a measure of CWC’s proportionate earnings in that Proportionate Adjusted Segment EBITDA does not include all of the costs that are included in net earnings or loss or other GAAP measures of earnings. At June 30, 2017, the noncontrolling interests’ share of CWC’s net third-party debt was $151 million. The noncontrolling interests’ share of CWC’s Adjusted Segment EBITDA was $48.0 million and $94.8 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively. 38 Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio is defined in accordance with CWC’s Credit Agreement dated May 26, 2017, taking into account the ratio of its outstanding indebtedness (subject to certain exclusions) less its cash and cash equivalents to its Consolidated EBITDA for the last twelve months, reduced proportionately to reflect any non-controlling interests in both indebtedness and EBITDA. 39 International Financial Reporting Standards, as promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), are referred to as IASB-IFRS. 40 Omitted. 41 Omitted. C-15 ----- Additional General Notes: Most of our broadband communications subsidiaries provide telephony, broadband internet, data, video or other B2B services. Certain of our B2B revenue is derived from SOHO subscribers that pay a premium price to receive enhanced service levels along with video, internet or telephony services that are the same or similar to the mass marketed products offered to our residential subscribers. All mass marketed products provided to SOHOs, whether or not accompanied by enhanced service levels and/or premium prices, are included in the respective RGU and customer counts of our broadband communications operations, with only those services provided at premium prices considered to be “SOHO RGUs” or “SOHO customers.” To the extent our existing customers upgrade from a residential product offering to a SOHO product offering, the number of SOHO RGUs or SOHO customers will increase, but there is no impact to our total RGU or customer counts. Due to system limitations, SOHO customers of CWC are not included in our respective RGU and customer counts as of June 30, 2017. With the exception of our B2B SOHO subscribers, we generally do not count customers of B2B services as customers or RGUs for external reporting purposes. While we take appropriate steps to ensure that subscriber statistics are presented on a consistent and accurate basis at any given balance sheet date, the variability from country to country in (i) the nature and pricing of products and services, (ii) the distribution platform, (iii) billing systems, (iv) bad debt collection experience and (v) other factors add complexity to the subscriber counting process. We periodically review our subscriber counting policies and underlying systems to improve the accuracy and consistency of the data reported on a prospective basis. Accordingly, we may from time to time make appropriate adjustments to our subscriber statistics based on those reviews. Subscriber information for acquired entities, including CWC, is preliminary and subject to adjustment until we have completed our review of such information and determined that it is presented in accordance with our policies.

CWC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of LGE Coral Holdco Limited (LGE Coral Holdco), a subsidiary of Liberty Global plc (Liberty Global). In these notes, the terms “CWC,” “we,” “our,” “our company” and “us” may refer, as the context requires, to CWC or collectively to CWC and its subsidiaries. CWC is incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom (U.K.). The address of our registered office is Griffin House, 161 Hammersmith Road, London W6 8BS. Our unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard (IAS) 34, Interim Financial Reporting (IAS 34) and do not include all of the information required by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) (IASB-IFRS) for full annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, these financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended December 31, 2016, which were prepared in accordance with IASB-IFRS and include a description of the significant accounting policies followed in these financial statements. The preparation of condensed consolidated interim financial statements in accordance with IAS 34 requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates and assumptions are used in accounting for, among other things, the valuation of acquisition-related assets and liabilities, allowances for uncollectible accounts, programming and copyright costs, deferred income taxes and the related recognition of deferred tax assets, loss contingencies, fair value measurements, impairment assessments, capitalization of internal costs associated with construction and installation activities, useful lives of long-lived assets, share-based compensation and actuarial liabilities associated with certain benefit plans.

At March 31, 2017, we have provided guarantees of $361.0 million, in aggregate, for financial obligations principally in respect of a number of business disposals, property and other leases, bank guarantees and letters of credit (primarily related to government contracts and bids), as well as guarantees and indemnities in relation to a number of business disposals. Generally, the liability for business disposals has been capped at no more than the value of the sales proceeds, although some uncapped indemnities have been given. In relation to the April 2013 disposal of our interests in operations primarily in the Maldives, the Channel Islands and Isle of Man, South Atlantic and Diego Garcia to Batelco International Group Holding Limited, we provided a guarantee for up to $300.0 million in respect of tax-related claims. This guarantee expires in April 2020. We also provided indemnities to the purchaser in respect of the May 2014 disposal of Monaco Telecom. We also give warranties and indemnities in relation to certain agreements including facility sharing agreements, certain of which do not contain liability caps. In addition, we are a party to a Contingent Funding Agreement with the Trustees of the CWSF.

The Liberty Global Transaction triggered regulatory approval requirements in certain jurisdictions in_ which we operate. The regulatory authorities in certain of these jurisdictions, including the Bahamas, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Seychelles and Cayman Islands, have not completed their review of the Liberty Global Transaction or granted their approval. Such approvals may include binding conditions or requirements that could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial condition. _Other regulatory Issues. Video distribution, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile businesses are_ regulated in each of the countries in which we operate. The scope of regulation varies from country to country. Adverse regulatory developments could subject our businesses to a number of risks. Regulation, including conditions imposed on us by competition or other authorities as a requirement to close acquisitions or dispositions, could limit growth, revenue and the number and types of services offered and could lead to increased operating costs and property and equipment additions. In addition, regulation may restrict our operations and subject them to further competitive pressure, including pricing restrictions, interconnect and other access obligations, and restrictions or controls on content, including content provided by third parties. Failure to comply with current or future regulation could expose our businesses to various penalties.

IFRS 15 will also impact our accounting for certain upfront costs directly associated with obtaining and fulfilling customer contracts. Under our current policy, these costs are expensed as incurred unless the costs are in the scope of another accounting topic that allows for capitalization. Under IFRS 15, the upfront costs that are currently expensed as incurred will be recognized as assets and amortized over a period that is consistent with the transfer to the customers of the goods or services to which the assets relate, which we have generally interpreted to be the expected customer life. The impact of the accounting change for these costs will be dependent on numerous factors, including the number of new subscriber contracts added in any given period, but we expect the adoption of this accounting change will initially result in the deferral of a significant amount of operating and selling costs. The ultimate impact of adopting IFRS 15 for both revenue recognition and costs to obtain and fulfill contracts will depend on the promotions and offers in place during the period leading up to and after the adoption of IFRS 15. (d) In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16, Leases (IFRS 16), which supersedes IAS 17 Leases (IAS 17). IFRS 16 will result in lessees recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the statement of financial position, with lease assets to reflect the right-of-use and corresponding lease liabilities reflecting the present value of the lease payments. IFRS 16 will also result in additional disclosures about leasing arrangements and eliminate the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases for a lessee. IFRS 16 requires lessees and lessors to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The modified retrospective approach also includes a number of optional practical expedients an entity may elect to apply. IFRS 16 also replaces the straight-line operating lease expense for those lessees applying IAS 17 with a depreciation charge for the lease asset and an interest expense on the lease liability. This change aligns the lease expense treatment for all leases. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019, while early adoption is permitted if IFRS 15 is applied. We will adopt IFRS 16 on January 1, 2019. Although we are currently evaluating the effect that IFRS 16 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, we expect the adoption of this standard will increase the number of leases included in our consolidated statement of financial position. (e) We evaluated the impact of applying these accounting standards on our consolidated financial statements and do not believe the impact of the adoption of these standards to be material. The details of our realized and unrealized gains (losses) on derivative instruments, included in finance expense in our condensed consolidated statements of operations, are as follows: of, or are derived from, observable Level 2 data for substantially the full term of these instruments. This observable data mostly includes interest rate futures and swap rates, which are retrieved or derived from available market data. Although we may extrapolate or interpolate this data, we do not otherwise alter this data in performing our valuations. We incorporate a credit risk valuation adjustment in our fair value measurements to estimate the impact of both our own nonperformance risk and the nonperformance risk of our counterparties. Effective January 1, 2017, we incorporated a Monte Carlo based approach into our calculation of the value assigned to the risk that we or our counterparties will default on our respective derivative obligations. Previously, we used a static calculation derived from our most current mark-to-market valuation to calculate the impact of counterparty credit risk. The adoption of a Monte Carlo based approach did not have a material impact on the overall fair value of our derivative instruments. Our and our counterparties’ credit spreads represent our most significant Level 3 inputs and these inputs are used to derive the credit risk valuation adjustments with respect to these instruments. As we would not expect changes in our or our counterparties’ credit spreads to have a significant impact on the valuations of these instruments, we have determined that these valuations fall under Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Due to the lack of Level 2 inputs for the valuation of the U.S. dollar to Jamaican dollar cross-currency swaps, we believe this valuation falls under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Our credit risk valuation adjustments with respect to our cross-currency and interest rate swaps are quantified and further explained in note 3. We have bifurcated an embedded derivative associated with certain redemption terms of our CWC Notes (for additional information, see note 8). The recurring fair value measurements of these embedded derivatives are determined using observable Level 2 data applying a binomial tree/lattice approach based on the Hull-White single factor interest rate term structure model. Under this approach, an interest rate lattice is constructed according to a given short-rate volatility and mean reversion constant as implied by the market at each valuation date. Fair value measurements are also used in connection with nonrecurring valuations performed in connection with impairment assessments and acquisition accounting. These nonrecurring valuations include the valuation of cashgenerating units, customer relationship intangible assets and property and equipment. The valuation of cashgenerating units is based at least in part on discounted cash flow analyses. With the exception of certain inputs for our weighted average cost of capital and discount rate calculations that are derived from pricing services, the inputs used in our discounted cash flow analyses, such as forecasts of future cash flows, are based on our assumptions, which are consistent with a market participant’s approach. The valuation of customer relationships is primarily based on an excess earnings methodology, which is a form of a discounted cash flow analysis. The excess earnings methodology requires us to estimate the specific cash flows expected from the customer relationship, considering such factors as estimated customer life, the revenue expected to be generated over the life of the customer relationship, contributory asset charges and other factors. Tangible assets are typically valued using a replacement or reproduction cost approach, considering factors such as current prices of the same or similar equipment, the age of the equipment and economic obsolescence. All of our nonrecurring valuations use significant unobservable inputs and therefore fall under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. We did not perform any significant nonrecurring fair value measurements during the three months ended March 31, 2017. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we finalized our nonrecurring valuation for the purpose of determining the acquisition accounting for Columbus International, Inc. F-14 ----- The fair values of financial assets and liabilities, together with the carrying amounts shown in our condensed consolidated statements of financial position, are as follows: Pre-tax amounts recognized in our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 related to our financial assets and liabilities are as follows: (b) Amounts relate to U.K. Government Gilts, which are held as security against certain noncurrent employee benefit plan liabilities. Accordingly, these financial assets are restricted. (c) Restricted cash represents funding for seniority provisions in Panama. Finance income is composed of the following: The following table provides details of our related-party balances: Programming commitments consist of obligations associated with certain of our programming and sports rights contracts that are enforceable and legally binding on us as we have agreed to pay minimum fees without regard to (i) the actual number of subscribers to the programming services, (ii) whether we terminate service to a portion of our subscribers or dispose of a portion of our distribution systems or (iii) whether we discontinue our premium sports services. In addition, programming commitments do not include increases in future periods associated with contractual inflation or other price adjustments that are not fixed. Accordingly, the amounts reflected in the above table with respect to these contracts are significantly less than the amounts we expect to pay in these periods under these contracts. Historically, payments to programming vendors have represented a significant portion of our operating costs, and we expect that this will continue to be the case in future periods. Programming costs in our condensed consolidated statements of operations include the amortization of certain live-programming rights in certain of our markets. Network and connectivity commitments include our domestic network service agreements with certain other telecommunications companies. The amounts reflected in the above table with respect to these commitments represent fixed minimum amounts payable under these agreements and, therefore, may be less than the actual amounts we ultimately pay in these periods. Purchase commitments include unconditional and legally binding obligations related to (i) the purchase of customer premises and other equipment and (ii) certain service-related commitments, including call center, information technology and maintenance services. In addition to the commitments set forth in the table above, we have significant commitments under (i) derivative instruments and (ii) defined benefit plans and similar agreements, pursuant to which we expect to make payments in future periods. For information regarding our derivative instruments, including the net cash paid or received in connection with these instruments during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, see note 3. As of March 31, 2017, our reportable segments are as follows: - Jamaica - Trinidad and Tobago - Barbados - Ventures and other - Panama - The Bahamas Telecommunications Company Limited (BTC) - Networks and LatAm - Seychelles Our reportable segments set forth above, other than Networks and LatAM, derive their revenue primarily from communications services, including mobile, fixed-line telephony, broadband internet, video and business-to-business (B2B) services. Our Networks and LatAm segment primarily derives its revenue from broadband connectivity solutions to businesses and government institutions.

IFRS 9 also includes new regulations regarding the application of hedge accounting to better reflect an entity’s risk management activities, especially with regard to managing non-financial risks. This new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, while early application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect that IFRS 9 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. (c) In May 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (IFRS 15), which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. IFRS 15 will replace existing revenue recognition guidance in IASB-IFRS when it becomes effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. This new standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We will adopt IFRS 15 effective January 1, 2018 using the cumulative effect transition method. While we are continuing to evaluate the effect that IFRS 15 will have on our consolidated financial statements, we have identified a number of our current revenue recognition policies and disclosures that will be impacted by IFRS 15, including the accounting for (i) time-limited discounts and free periods provided to our customers, (ii) certain up-front fees charged to our customers and (iii) subsidized handset plans. These impacts are discussed below: - When we enter into contracts to provide services to our customers, we often provide time-limited discounts or free service periods. Under current accounting rules, we recognize revenue net of discounts during the promotional periods and do not recognize any revenue during free service periods. Under IFRS 15, revenue recognition will be accelerated for these contracts as the impact of the discount or free service period will be recognized uniformly over the total contractual period. - When we enter into contracts to provide services to our customers, we often charge installation or other up-front fees. Under current accounting rules, installation fees related to services provided over our fiber are recognized as revenue in the period during which the installation occurs to the extent these fees are equal to or less than direct selling costs. Under IFRS 15, these fees will generally be deferred and recognized as revenue over the contractual period, or longer if the up-front fee results in a material renewal right. - IFRS 15 will require the identification of deliverables in contracts with customers that qualify as performance obligations. The transaction price receivable from customers will be allocated between our performance obligations under contracts on a relative stand-alone selling price basis. Currently, we offer handsets under a subsidized contract model, whereby upfront revenue recognition is limited to the upfront cash collected from the customer as the remaining monthly fees to be received from the customer, including fees that may be associated with the handset, are contingent upon delivering future airtime. This limitation will no longer be applied under IFRS 15. The primary impact on revenue reporting will be that when we sell subsidized handsets together with airtime services to customers, revenue allocated to handsets and recognized when control of the device passes to the customer will increase and revenue recognized as services are delivered will reduce. - IFRS 15 will require costs incurred to fulfill a customer contract involving the sale of an asset to be recognized only when those costs (i) relate directly to a contract or to an anticipated contract that can be specifically identified, (ii) generate or enhance resources that will be used in satisfying performance obligations in the future and (iii) are expected to be recovered. Currently, we recognize costs related to mobile handset sales as incurred and we do not expect the adoption of IFRS 15 to have a material impact on our recognition of these costs.

Although we generally seek to match the denomination of our and our subsidiaries’ borrowings with the functional currency of the operations that are supporting the respective borrowings, market conditions or other factors may cause us to enter into borrowing arrangements that are not denominated in the functional currency of the underlying operations (unmatched debt). Our policy is generally to provide for an economic hedge against foreign currency exchange rate movements by using derivative instruments to synthetically convert unmatched debt into the applicable underlying currency. At March 31, 2017, substantially all of our debt was either directly or synthetically matched to the applicable functional currencies of the underlying operations.

952_1,Offerings 2017.md,449,LIABILITIES,449.18,(4) Fair Value Measurements,449.18.1,,"We measure our derivative instruments at fair value. The reported fair values of these derivative instruments as of March 31, 2017 likely will not represent the value that will be paid or received upon the ultimate settlement or disposition of these assets and liabilities. We expect that the values realized generally will be based on market conditions at the time of settlement, which may occur at the maturity of the derivative instrument or at the time of the repayment or refinancing of the underlying debt instrument. We disclose fair value measurements according to a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted market prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. We record transfers of assets or liabilities into or out of Levels 1, 2 or 3 at the beginning of the quarter during which the transfer occurred. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, no such transfers were made. All of our Level 2 inputs (interest rate futures, swap rates and certain of the inputs for our weighted average cost of capital calculations) and certain of our Level 3 inputs (forecasted volatilities and credit spreads) are obtained from pricing services. These inputs, or interpolations or extrapolations thereof, are used in our internal models to calculate, among other items, yield curves, forward interest and currency rates and weighted average cost of capital rates. In the normal course of business, we receive market value assessments from the counterparties to our derivative contracts. Although we compare these assessments to our internal valuations and investigate unexpected differences, we do not otherwise rely on counterparty quotes to determine the fair values of our derivative instruments. The midpoints of applicable bid and ask ranges generally are used as inputs for our internal valuations. In order to manage our interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk, we have entered into various derivative instruments, as further described in note 3.

(c) In connection with our acquisition of Columbus in March 2015, certain conditions were included in the regulatory approval of the transaction from the Telecommunications Authority of Trinidad and Tobago, including the requirement that we dispose of our investment in TSTT by a certain date, which was recently extended to June 30, 2017. We cannot predict when, or if, we will be able to dispose of this investment at an acceptable price. As such, no assurance can be given that we will be able to recover the carrying value of our investment in TSTT. We are not able to reliably measure the fair value of our investment in TSTT.

The interest rates presented represent stated rates and do not include the impact of derivative instruments, deferred financing costs, original issue premiums or discounts and commitment fees, all of which affect our overall cost of borrowing. Including the effects of derivative instruments, original issue premiums or discounts and commitment fees, but excluding the impact of financing costs, our weighted average interest rate on our aggregate variable- and fixed-rate indebtedness was 6.81% at March 31, 2017. For information regarding our derivative instruments, see note 3. (b) Unused borrowing capacity under the CWC Credit Facilities includes $625.0 million under the CWC Revolving Credit Facility, which represents the maximum availability without regard to covenant compliance calculations or other conditions precedent to borrowing. At March 31, 2017, based on the applicable leverage and other financial covenants, which take into account letters of credit issued in connection with the Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund (CWSF), $612.5 million of unused borrowing capacity was available to be borrowed under the CWC Credit Facilities. When the relevant March 31, 2017 compliance reporting requirements have been completed, and assuming no changes from March 31, 2017 borrowing levels, we anticipate that $612.5 million of unused borrowing capacity under the CWC Credit Facilities will continue to be available to be borrowed. (c) The estimated fair values of our debt instruments are determined using the average of applicable bid and ask prices (mostly Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy) or, when quoted market prices are unavailable or not considered indicative of fair value, discounted cash flow models (mostly Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy). The discount rates used in the cash flow models are based on the market interest rates and estimated credit spreads of the applicable entity, to the extent available, and other relevant factors. For additional information regarding fair value hierarchies, see note 4. (d) In March 2017, a 49%-owned subsidiary of CWC, Cable & Wireless Panama, SA (CW Panama), issued $100.0 million of subordinated debt. The term loan bears interest at 4.5%, payable on a semi-annual basis, and matures in March 2021. The proceeds from the term loan were used for general corporate purposes.

Cash outflows associated with network obligations are expected to occur over the shorter of the period to exit and the lease contract life. Our legal and other provisions include amounts relating to specific legal claims against our company and certain employee benefits and sales taxes. The timing of the utilization of the provision is uncertain and is largely outside our control, including matters that are contingent upon litigation. During 2015, we received an unfavorable ruling associated with pre-acquisition legal risks of Columbus and were ordered to pay the majority of the Columbus purchase price hold back, a disputed non-competition payment and other amounts (including costs) of approximately $11.0 million in aggregate, substantially all of which was paid during the year ended March 31, 2016.

The statutory rate represents the blended rate that will be in effect for the year ended December 31, 2017 based on the 20.0% statutory rate that was in effect for the first quarter of 2017 and the 19.0% statutory rate that will be in effect for the remainder of 2017. There was no income tax expense associated with gains and losses presented within other comprehensive loss during the three months ended March 31, 2017. Through our subsidiaries, we maintain a presence in many countries. Many of these countries maintain highly complex tax regimes that differ significantly from the system of income taxation used in the U.K. We have accounted for the effect of these taxes based on what we believe is reasonably expected to apply to us and our subsidiaries based on tax laws currently in effect and reasonable interpretations of these laws. Because some jurisdictions do not have systems of taxation that are as well established as the system of income taxation used in the U.K. or tax regimes used in other major industrialized countries, it may be difficult to anticipate how other jurisdictions will tax our and our subsidiaries’ current and future operations. The income taxes of CWC and its subsidiaries are presented on a separate return basis for each tax-paying entity or group based on the local tax law.

This change is based on our new operating structure and aligns with how our chief operating decision maker reviews our operating results. Accordingly, our comparative period has been retroactively revised to reflect these changes. Generally, we identify our segments on a geographical basis and, in certain cases, on a product basis. Each country in which we operate is generally treated as an operating segment. The aggregation of operating segments into their reporting segments reflects (i) the similar economic and regulatory characteristics within each of those segments, (ii) the similar nature of its products and services and (iii) its customers. In certain cases, we may elect to include an operating segment in our segment disclosure that does not meet the above-described criteria for a reportable segment. We have eight reportable segments that provide mobile, fixed-line telephony, broadband internet, video and managed services to residential and business customers. F-28 -----",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

For additional information regarding the Liberty Global Transaction, see note 18. Effective December 30, 2016, CWC Limited, LGE Coral Mergerco B.V. (LGE Coral Mergerco) and LG Coral Mergerco Limited (LG Coral Mergerco), each a subsidiary of Liberty Global, completed a cross-border merger, with LG Coral Mergerco as the surviving entity (the Merger). LG Coral Mergerco immediately changed its name to Cable & Wireless Communications Limited (CWC). For further information, see note 18. CWC is a provider of mobile, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and video services to residential and business customers and managed services to business and government customers, primarily in the Caribbean and Latin America. CWC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of LGE Coral Holdco Limited (LGE Coral Holdco), a subsidiary of Liberty Global. In these notes, the terms “CWC,” “we,” “our,” “our company” and “us” may refer, as the context requires, to CWC or collectively to CWC and its subsidiaries. CWC is incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom (U.K.). The address of our registered office is Griffin House, 161 Hammersmith Road, London W6 8BS. _Basis of presentation_ In connection with the Liberty Global Transaction, effective December 31, 2016 we changed our fiscal year end from March 31 to December 31 to coincide with Liberty Global’s fiscal year end. Our annual consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB-IFRS), on a historical cost basis except for liabilities for cash-settled share-based payment arrangements, derivative instruments and assets held-for-sale, which are measured at fair value. Certain noncurrent assets and disposal groups are stated at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.

For additional information, see note 25. Subsequent to December 31, 2016, the U.S. Carve-out Entities were acquired by subsidiaries of CWC. For additional information, see note 30.

Unless otherwise indicated, convenience translations into U.S. dollars are calculated as of December 31, 2016. _Reclassifications_ In connection with the Liberty Global Transaction, we revised the presentation of our consolidated financial statements to align with the presentation policies of Liberty Global.

Due to their relatively short maturities, the carrying values of these financial instruments approximate their respective fair value. The carrying amounts of trade receivables with a remaining term of more than one year are included in noncurrent assets, and the carrying amounts of these receivables approximate their fair value. The carrying amounts of trade receivables with a remaining term of more than one year, loans and other receivables are recognized initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and receivables are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. For information concerning how we arrive at certain of our fair value measurements, see note 8. _Fair value through profit or loss_ Financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets and liabilities that are held-for-trading and those designated upon initial recognition. Financial assets and liabilities are classified as held-for-trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling in the near term or if designated as such by the company. These financial assets are initially recognized at fair value. Subsequent gains or losses related to changes in fair value are recognized in finance income or finance expense, respectively, in our statement of operations. _Debt_ Debt is recognized initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortized cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value of our debt is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations over the respective term of the borrowings using the effective interest method.",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

Changes to the fair value of our derivative instruments are recognized in realized and unrealized gains or losses on derivative instruments within either finance expense or finance income in our consolidated statements of operations. The net cash received or paid related to our derivative instruments is classified as an operating, investing or financing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows based on the objective of the derivative instrument and the classification of the applicable underlying cash flows. For derivative contracts that are terminated prior to maturity, the cash paid or received upon termination that relates to future periods is classified as a financing activity.

Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment at least annually. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis and reviewed for impairment when circumstances warrant. Each reporting period, we evaluate the estimated useful lives of our intangible assets that are subject to amortization to determine whether events or circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that it may be impaired.

Property and equipment acquired by way of a finance lease are initially stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value or the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease. The leased asset is subsequently depreciated over the shorter of its estimated useful life or the lease term and is subject to impairment assessments as a component of the applicable cash-generating unit. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate on the finance balance outstanding. The corresponding lease obligations, net of finance charges, are included in debt with the interest element of the lease payment charged to our consolidated statements of operations over the lease period. All other leases are classified as operating leases with payments being recognized in our consolidated statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

The functional currency of our foreign operations generally is the applicable local currency for each foreign subsidiary and equity method investee. Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries (including intercompany balances for which settlement is not anticipated in the foreseeable future) are translated at the spot rate in effect at the applicable reporting date. With the exception of certain material transactions, the amounts reported in our consolidated statements of operations are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the applicable period. The resulting unrealized cumulative translation adjustment, net of applicable income taxes, is recorded in foreign currency translation reserve in our consolidated statements of changes in owners’ equity. With the exception of certain material transactions, the cash flows from our operations in foreign countries are translated at the average rate for the applicable period in our consolidated statements of cash flows.

Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities at undiscounted values. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amounts are those that are enacted or substantively enacted as of the statement of financial position date. Generally, deferred taxes are recognized for any temporary differences between the tax base and the IASB-IFRS base, except in situations where goodwill is not recognized for tax purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and tax loss and interest carryforwards, if it is probable that future taxable earnings will be available against which the unused tax losses or temporary differences can be utilized. However, deferred tax assets are not recognized if the deferred tax asset arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting earnings nor taxable earnings.

In addition to cash and cash equivalents, our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operations and access to the available borrowing capacity of our various debt facilities. For additional information related to our debt, see note 14. Our liquidity is generally used to fund (i) corporate general and administrative expenses, (ii) interest payments on the CWC Notes and CWC Credit Facilities (each as defined and described in note 14), (iii) satisfy obligations under our employee benefit plans, (iv) the satisfaction of contingent liabilities, (v) acquisitions, (vi) other investment opportunities or (vii) income tax payments. Our most significant financial obligations relate to our debt obligations, which are described in note 14. The terms of certain of our debt contain various restrictions, including covenants that restrict our ability to incur additional debt. As a result, additional debt financing is only a potential source of liquidity if the incurrence of any new debt is permitted by the terms of our existing debt instruments. As of December 31, 2016, Columbus was restricted from incurring additional financial indebtedness. Our ability to generate cash from our operations will depend on our future operating performance, which is in turn dependent, to some extent, on general economic, financial, competitive, market, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We believe that our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our currently anticipated working capital needs, capital expenditures and other liquidity requirements during the next 12 months, although no assurance can be given that this will be the case. In this regard, it is not possible to predict how economic conditions, sovereign debt concerns and/or any adverse regulatory developments could impact the credit markets we access and, accordingly, our future liquidity and financial position. In addition, sustained or increased competition, particularly in combination with adverse economic or regulatory developments, could have an unfavorable impact on our cash flows and liquidity. We use budgeting and cash flow forecasting tools to ensure that we will have sufficient resources to timely meet our liquidity requirements. We also maintain a liquidity reserve to provide for unanticipated cash outflows. F-58 -----",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

We manage these credit risks through the evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of, and concentration of risk with, the respective counterparties. In this regard, credit risk associated with our derivative instruments is spread across a relatively broad counterparty base of banks and financial institutions. Collateral has not been posted by either party under the derivative instruments of our subsidiary borrowing groups. At December 31, 2016, our exposure to counterparty credit risk included derivative assets with an aggregate fair value of $11.6 million. We have entered into derivative instruments under master agreements with each counterparty that contain master netting arrangements that are applicable in the event of early termination by either party to such derivative instrument. The master netting arrangements under each of these master agreements are limited to the derivative instruments governed by the relevant master agreement within each individual borrowing group and are independent of similar arrangements of our other subsidiary borrowing groups. Under our derivative contracts, it is generally only the non-defaulting party that has a contractual option to exercise early termination rights upon the default of the other counterparty and to set off other liabilities against sums due upon such termination. However, in an insolvency of a derivative counterparty, under the laws of certain jurisdictions, the defaulting counterparty or its insolvency representatives may be able to compel the termination of one or more derivative contracts and trigger early termination payment liabilities payable by us, reflecting any mark-to-market value of the contracts for the counterparty. Alternatively, or in addition, the insolvency laws of certain jurisdictions may require the mandatory set off of amounts due under such derivative contracts against present and future liabilities owed to us under other contracts between us and the relevant counterparty. Accordingly, it is possible that we may be subject to obligations to make payments, or may have present or future liabilities owed to us partially or fully discharged by set off as a result of such obligations, in the event of the insolvency of a derivative counterparty, even though it is the counterparty that is in default and not us. To the extent that we are required to make such payments, our ability to do so will depend on our liquidity and capital resources at the time. In an insolvency of a defaulting counterparty, we will be an unsecured creditor in respect of any amount owed to us by the defaulting counterparty, except to the extent of the value of any collateral we have obtained from that counterparty. In addition, where a counterparty is in financial difficulty, under the laws of certain jurisdictions, the relevant regulators may be able to (i) compel the termination of one or more derivative instruments, determine the settlement amount and/or compel, without any payment, the partial or full discharge of liabilities arising from such early termination that are payable by the relevant counterparty or (ii) transfer the derivative instruments to an alternative counterparty.",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

Historically, these arrangements have not resulted in our company making any material payments and we do not believe that they will result in material payments in the future. At December 31, 2016, we have provided guarantees of $355.0 million, in aggregate, for financial obligations principally in respect of a number of business disposals, property and other leases, bank guarantees and letters of credit (primarily related to government contracts and bids), as well as guarantees and indemnities in relation to a number of business disposals. Generally, liability has been capped at no more than the value of the sales proceeds, although some uncapped indemnities have been given. In relation to the April 2013 disposal of our interests in operations primarily in the Maldives, the Channel Islands and Isle of Man, South Atlantic and Diego Garcia to Batelco International Group Holding Limited, we provided a guarantee for up to $300.0 million in respect of tax-related claims. This guarantee expires in April 2020. We also provided indemnities to the purchaser in respect of the May 2014 disposal of Monaco Telecom. We also give warranties and indemnities in relation to certain agreements including facility sharing agreements, certain of which do not contain liability caps. In addition, we are a party to the Contingent Funding Agreement with the Trustees of the CWSF.

In 2015, a claim was filed against a subsidiary of Columbus by the Copyright Music Organization_ of Trinidad and Tobago (COTT) for damages of copyright infringement related to musical works transmitted by the subsidiary. We have recorded a provision based on our best estimate of the potential liability associated with this claim. While we generally expect that the amounts required to satisfy this contingency will not materially differ from the estimated amount we have accrued, no assurance can be given that the resolution of the COTT claim will not result in a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. _Regulatory. The Liberty Global Transaction triggered regulatory approval requirements in certain jurisdictions in_ which we operate. The regulatory authorities in certain of these jurisdictions, including the Bahamas, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Seychelles and Cayman Islands, have not completed their review of the Liberty Global Transaction or granted their approval.

The impact the reclassifications had on certain revenue and other amounts are described further below. The following table summarizes the reclassifications to our consolidated statement of financial position at March 31, 2016: The following tables summarize the reclassifications to our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015: The following table summarizes the reclassifications to our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015: result in additional disclosures about leasing arrangements and eliminate the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases for a lessee. IFRS 16 requires lessees and lessors to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The modified retrospective approach also includes a number of optional practical expedients an entity may elect to apply. IFRS 16 also replaces the straight-line operating lease expense for those lessees applying IAS 17 with a depreciation charge for the lease asset and an interest expense on the lease liability. This change aligns the lease expense treatment for all leases. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019, while early adoption is permitted if IFRS 15 is applied. Although we are currently evaluating the effect that IFRS 16 will have on our consolidated financial statements, we expect the adoption of this standard will increase the number of leases included in our consolidated statement of financial position. (e) We evaluated the impact of applying these accounting standards on our consolidated financial statements and do not believe the impact of the adoption of these standards to be material. accounted for as separate items (major components) of property and equipment. We capitalize costs associated with the construction of new cable transmission and distribution facilities and the installation of new cable services. Capitalized construction and installation costs include materials, labor and other directly attributable construction and installation costs and the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which the assets are located. Installation activities that are capitalized include (i) the initial connection (or drop) from our cable system to a customer location, (ii) the replacement of a drop and (iii) the installation of equipment for additional services, such as digital cable, telephone or broadband internet service. The costs of other customer-facing activities such as reconnecting customer locations where a drop already exists, disconnecting customer locations and repairing or maintaining drops, are expensed as incurred. Financing costs capitalized with respect to construction activities were not material during any of the periods presented. Items of property and equipment are depreciated from the date they are available for use or, in respect of selfconstructed assets, from the date that the asset is completed and ready for use. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each major component of an item of property and equipment. The cable distribution systems have estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 30 years. Support equipment have estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 40 years. Buildings (including leasehold improvements) have estimated useful lives up to 40 years. Customer premises equipment have estimated useful lives of 4 to 10 years. Land is not depreciated. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and may be adjusted based on management’s expectations of future use. Assets held under financing leases are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life of the asset. Property and equipment are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. Impairment exists when the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For purposes of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets (cash-generating units). Impairment losses are reversed if the reasons for the impairment loss no longer exist or the impairment loss has decreased. Subsequent costs are included in the assets’ carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will be achieved and when the cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of any replaced item is derecognized. All other expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Gains and losses due to disposals are included in other operating income in our consolidated statements of operations. costs to sell or value in use) of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill and then to the other assets pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period. Customer relationships and trade names are recognized at their fair values in connection with business combinations and are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from 4 to 20 years. Costs associated with maintaining computer software are expensed as incurred. Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by us for which it is probable that the expected future economic benefits attributable to the assets would flow to our company beyond one year are recognized as intangible assets. Capitalized internal-use software costs include only external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software and payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to the project. Capitalization of these costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose. Capitalized internal-use software costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over their applicable expected useful lives, which are approximately three years. Where no internal-use intangible asset can be recognized, development expenditures are expensed as incurred. Subsequent expenditures related to intangible assets are capitalized only when the expenditures increase the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditures, including expenditures on internally generated brands, are expensed as incurred. the fair value of the plan assets, less the present value of the defined benefit obligations. Defined benefit obligations for each plan are calculated annually by independent qualified actuaries. Defined benefit assets are only recognized to the extent they are deemed recoverable. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognized in full in the period in which they arise through the statement of comprehensive income together with returns on plan assets, excluding net interest that is recorded in our consolidated statement of operations. These remeasurements are not subsequently reclassified to profit or loss. Other movements in the net pension deficit or surplus are recognized in other operating expenses in our consolidated statement of operations. These generally comprise current and past service costs, including those arising from settlements and curtailments, and net interest amounts representing the change in the present value of plan obligations and plan assets resulting from the unwinding of discounts. Certain of our subsidiaries participate in externally managed defined contribution pension plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which we have no further obligation once the fixed defined contribution has been paid to the third-party administrator of the plan. Contributions under our defined contribution pension plan are recognized as incurred in other operating expenses in our consolidated statement of operations. For additional information on our employee benefit plans, see note 20. _Sale of Multiple Products and Services. We sell video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and, in most of_ our markets, mobile services to our customers in bundled packages at a rate lower than if the customer purchased each product on a standalone basis. Revenue from bundled packages generally is allocated proportionally to the individual services based on the relative standalone price for each respective service. _Mobile Revenue—General. Consideration from mobile contracts is allocated to the airtime service element and_ the handset service element based on the relative standalone prices of each element. The amount of consideration allocated to the handset is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of future airtime services. Certain of our operations that provide mobile services offer handsets under a subsidized contract model, whereby upfront revenue recognition is limited to the upfront cash collected from the customer as the remaining monthly fees to be received from the customer, including fees that may be associated with the handset, are contingent upon delivering future airtime services. _Mobile Revenue—Airtime Services. We recognize revenue from mobile services in the period the related services_ are provided. Revenue from pre-pay customers is recorded as deferred revenue prior to the commencement of services and revenue is recognized as the services are rendered or usage rights expire. _Mobile Revenue—Handset Revenue. Arrangement consideration allocated to handsets is recognized as revenue_ when the goods have been delivered and title has passed. Our assessment of collectibility is based principally on internal and external credit assessments as well as historical collection information for similar customers. To the extent that collectibility of installment payments from the customer is not reasonably assured upon delivery of the handset, handset revenue is not recognized until collectibility is reasonably assured. _Business-to-Business (B2B) Revenue. We defer upfront installation and certain nonrecurring fees received on_ B2B contracts where we maintain ownership of the installed equipment. The deferred fees are amortized into revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the arrangement or the expected period of performance. _Promotional Discounts. For subscriber promotions, such as discounted or free services during an introductory_ period, revenue is recognized only to the extent of the discounted fees charged to the subscriber, if any. _Subscriber Advance Payments and Deposits. Payments received in advance for the services we provide are_ deferred and recognized as revenue when the associated services are provided. _Sales, Use and Other Value-Added Taxes (VAT). Revenue is recorded net of applicable sales, use and other_ value-added taxes. The recoverability of the carrying value of deferred taxes is determined based on management’s estimates of future taxable earnings. If it is no longer probable that enough future taxable earnings will be available against which the unused tax losses or temporary differences can be used, an impairment in a corresponding amount is recognized on the deferred tax assets. Deferred taxes are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted as of the balance sheet date. Deferred taxes are not discounted. If the changes in the value of assets or liabilities are recognized in a separate component of equity, the change of value of the corresponding deferred tax assets and liabilities are also recognized in this separate component of equity (instead of income tax expense). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset in our consolidated balance sheets if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity. For additional information concerning our income taxes, see note 17. Although we actively monitor the creditworthiness of our key vendors, the financial failure of a key vendor could disrupt our operations and have an adverse impact on our revenue and cash flows. While we currently have no specific concerns about the creditworthiness of any counterparty for which we have material credit risk exposures, the current economic conditions and uncertainties in global financial markets have increased the credit risk of our counterparties and we cannot rule out the possibility that one or more of our counterparties could fail or otherwise be unable to meet its obligations to us. Any such instance could have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. In this regard, (i) the financial failure of any of our counterparties could reduce amounts available under committed credit facilities and adversely impact our ability to access cash deposited with any failed financial institution and (ii) tightening of the credit markets could adversely impact our ability to access debt financing on favorable terms, or at all. Our maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amounts of our financial assets. We do not believe there is any significant credit risk associated with these financial instruments. The following table provides the timing of expected cash payments based on the contractually agreed upon terms for our financial liabilities as of December 31, 2016. The amounts are based on interest rates, interest payment dates and contractual maturities in effect as of December 31, 2016, as applicable. These amounts are presented for illustrative purposes only and will likely differ from the actual payments required in future periods. Assuming no change in the amounts outstanding, and without giving effect to any other variables, a hypothetical 50 basis point (0.50%) increase (decrease) in our weighted average variable interest rate would increase (decrease) our annual consolidated interest expense and cash outflows by approximately $5.8 million. _Foreign Currency Risk_ We are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our or our subsidiaries’ respective functional currencies (non-functional currency risk), such as equipment purchases, programming and indefeasible rights of use contracts, notes payable and notes receivable (including intercompany amounts). Changes in exchange rates with respect to amounts recorded in our consolidated statements of financial position related to these items will result in unrealized (based upon period-end exchange rates) or realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions. Moreover, to the extent that our revenue, costs and expenses are denominated in currencies other than our respective functional currencies, we will experience fluctuations in our revenue, costs and expenses solely as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Generally, we will consider hedging non-functional currency risks when the risks arise from agreements with third parties that involve the future payment or receipt of cash or other monetary items to the extent that we can reasonably predict the timing and amount of such payments or receipts and the payments or receipts are not otherwise hedged. In this regard, we have not hedged any non-functional currency risks related to our revenue, operating costs and expenses and/or property and equipment additions as of December 31, 2016. We also are exposed to unfavorable and potentially volatile fluctuations of the U.S. dollar (our presentation currency) against the currencies of our operating subsidiaries when their respective financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in foreign currency translation as a separate component of equity. Any increase (decrease) in the value of the U.S. dollar against any foreign currency that is the functional currency of one of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience unrealized foreign currency translation losses (gains) with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies. Accordingly, we may experience a negative impact on our comprehensive earnings (loss) and equity with respect to our holdings solely as a result of foreign currency translation. Our primary exposure to foreign currency risk during the nine months ended December 31, 2016 was to the Jamaican dollar, Trinidad and Tobago dollar and Colombian peso, as 8.3%, 6.9% and 1.2% of our U.S. dollar revenue during the period was derived from subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the Jamaican dollar, Trinidad and Tobago dollar and Colombian peso, respectively. In addition, our reported operating results are impacted by changes in the exchange rates for the Seychelles rupee and various other local currencies in the Caribbean and Latin America. We generally do not hedge against the risk that we may incur non-cash losses upon the translation of the financial statements of our subsidiaries and affiliates into U.S. dollars.

The fair value of these shares included a discount for lack of marketability. (b) The Principal Vendors entered into lock-up and put option arrangements in respect of the issued ordinary common shares in connection with the Columbus Acquisition. Under these arrangements each holder could require us to reacquire certain of the shares in four tranches between 2016 and 2019 at a strike price of $0.7349 per share. The fair value of the put option was recognized in capital and other reserves in our consolidated statements of changes in owners’ equity. The put option meets the definition of an equity instrument, accordingly, it is revalued to fair value at each reporting date. The financial liability (repurchase option) in connection with the put option was valued on initial recognition using the present value technique of the future liability. For additional information, see note 7. (c) The Columbus employee incentive share option plan was cancelled, with certain employees of Columbus rolling over their options into an equivalent CWC share option plan. As set out in IFRS 3, Business Combinations (IFRS 3), the fair value of these replacement awards attributable to the pre-acquisition service period is reflected as part of the consideration paid for Columbus. (d) As a consequence of the Columbus Acquisition, a deemed disposal of the shares of Columbus Dominicana S.A. was triggered giving rise to a potential capital gains tax liability of $5 million under Dominican Republic tax law. In addition, an indirect ownership transfer was triggered under Panamanian tax law for Columbus Networks S. de R.L, Telecommunications Corporativas Panamenas S.A., Columbus Networks de Panama SRL and Columbus Networks Maritima S. de R.L. giving rise to a tax liability of $1 million. As set out in IFRS 3, the fair value of these liabilities, which are paid on behalf of the seller, increased the consideration paid for Columbus.

On September 12, 2014, CW Panama agreed to acquire Panama-based Grupo Sonitel for $36 million, plus contingent consideration of up to an additional $5 million. Grupo Sonitel operates (i) SSA Sistemas, which provides end-to-end managed information technology solutions and telecommunication services to the government and business customers in Panama, as well as in El Salvador, Nicaragua and Peru, and (ii) Sonset, which provides information technology solutions and services to small and medium enterprise customers in Panama.

(8.5) $345.7 The following table provides details of the fair values of our derivative instrument assets and liabilities: _Interest Rate Swaps:_ The terms of our outstanding interest rate swap contracts at December 31, 2016, which are held by Sable, are as follows: We disclose fair value measurements according to a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted market prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. We record transfers of assets or liabilities into or out of Levels 1, 2 or 3 at the beginning of the quarter during which the transfer occurred. During the nine months ended December 31, 2016, no such transfers were made. All of our Level 2 inputs (interest rate futures, swap rates and certain of the inputs for our weighted average cost of capital calculations) and certain of our Level 3 inputs (forecasted volatilities and credit spreads) are obtained from pricing services. These inputs, or interpolations or extrapolations thereof, are used in our internal models to calculate, among other items, yield curves, forward interest and currency rates and weighted average cost of capital rates. In the normal course of business, we receive market value assessments from the counterparties to our derivative contracts. Although we compare these assessments to our internal valuations and investigate unexpected differences, we do not otherwise rely on counterparty quotes to determine the fair values of our derivative instruments. The midpoints of applicable bid and ask ranges generally are used as inputs for our internal valuations. In order to manage our interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk, we have entered into various derivative instruments, as further described in note 7. The recurring fair value measurements of these instruments are determined using discounted cash flow models. With the exception of the inputs for the U.S. dollar to Jamaican dollar cross-currency swaps (the Sable Currency Swaps), most of the inputs to these discounted cash flow models consist of, or are derived from, observable Level 2 data for substantially the full term of these instruments. This observable data includes most interest rate futures and swap rates, which are retrieved or derived from available market data. Although we may extrapolate or interpolate this data, we do not otherwise alter this data in performing our valuations. We incorporate a credit risk valuation adjustment in our fair value measurements to estimate the impact of both our own nonperformance risk and the nonperformance risk of our counterparties. Our and our counterparties’ credit spreads represent our most significant Level 3 inputs and these inputs are used to derive the credit risk valuation adjustments with respect to these instruments. As we would not expect changes in our or our counterparties’ credit spreads to have a significant impact on the valuations of these instruments, we have determined that these valuations (other than the Sable Currency Swaps) fall under Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Due to the lack of Level 2 inputs for the Sable Currency Swaps valuation, we believe this valuation falls under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Our credit risk valuation adjustments with respect to our cross-currency and interest rate swaps are quantified and further explained in note 7. We have bifurcated an embedded derivative associated with certain redemption terms of our Columbus Senior Notes and Sable Senior Notes (each as defined and described in note 14). The recurring fair value measurements of these embedded derivatives are determined using observable Level 2 data applying a binomial tree/lattice approach based on the Hull-White single factor interest rate term structure model. Under this approach, an interest rate lattice is constructed according to a given short-rate volatility and mean reversion constant as implied by the market at each valuation date. Fair value measurements are also used in connection with nonrecurring valuations performed in connection with impairment assessments and acquisition accounting. These nonrecurring valuations include the valuation of cashgenerating units, customer relationship intangible assets and property and equipment. The valuation of cashgenerating units is based at least in part on discounted cash flow analyses. Inputs for our weighted average cost of capital and discount rate calculations are derived from third-party pricing services. Forecasts of future cash flows are, in part, based on our assumptions, which are consistent with a market participant’s approach. The valuation of customer relationships is primarily based on an excess earnings methodology, which is a form of a discounted cash flow analysis. The excess earnings methodology requires us to estimate the specific cash flows expected from the customer relationship, considering such factors as estimated customer life, the revenue F-67 ----- expected to be generated over the life of the customer, contributory asset charges, and other factors. Tangible assets are typically valued using a replacement or reproduction cost approach, considering factors such as current prices of the same or similar equipment, the age of the equipment and economic obsolescence. All of our nonrecurring valuations use significant unobservable inputs and therefore fall under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. During the nine months ended December 31, 2016, we (i) performed a nonrecurring valuation for the purpose of determining the fair value of our investment in Telecommunications Services of Trinidad and Tobago Limited (TSTT) and (ii) recorded an impairment of $4.0 million related to certain sub-sea cable system assets, in connection with the fair value established in negotiations to sell these assets to an unrelated third-party. During the year ended March 31, 2016, we finalized our nonrecurring valuation for the purpose of determining the acquisition accounting for the Columbus Acquisition. The fair values of financial assets and liabilities, together with the carrying amounts shown in our consolidated statements of financial position, are as follows: Pre-tax amounts recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 and the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 related to our financial assets and liabilities are as follows: A reconciliation of the movements in the valuation basis of our financial instruments measured at fair value is as follows: The detailed aging of current trade receivables and related impairment amounts as of December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2016 is set forth below: The details of our assets held for sale are as follows: (a) Primarily includes equipment held for use and assets under construction. (b) In connection with the Liberty Global Transaction, we changed our property and equipment categories to conform with Liberty Global’s presentation. (c) Amounts include transfers from assets under construction for certain assets put into service during the current period and transfers related to new asset categories established in connection with the Liberty Global Transaction. (d) Amounts primarily include (i) transfers of customer premises equipment from inventory and (ii) the reclassification of our Barbados fiber network from assets held for sale. During the nine months ended December 31, 2016, we recorded non-cash increases to our property and equipment related to assets acquired under finance leases of $19.4 million. Changes during the year ended March 31, 2016 in the carrying amounts of our property and equipment, net, are as follows: The key assumptions used in the impairment review and the estimated recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit over its carrying value are as follows: _Credit Facilities. Each of our borrowing groups has entered into one or more credit facility agreements with_ certain financial institutions. Each of these credit facilities contain certain covenants, the more notable of which are as follows: - Our credit facilities contain certain consolidated gross or net leverage ratios, as specified in the relevant credit facility, which are required to be complied with on an incurrence and/or maintenance basis; - Our credit facilities contain certain restrictions which, among other things, restrict the ability of the members of the relevant borrowing group to (i) incur or guarantee certain financial indebtedness, (ii) make certain disposals and acquisitions, (iii) create certain security interests over their assets, in each case, subject to certain customary and agreed exceptions and (iv) make certain restricted payments to their direct and/or indirect parent companies (and indirectly to CWC or Liberty Global) through dividends, loans or other distributions, subject to compliance with applicable covenants; - Our credit facilities require that certain members of the relevant borrowing group guarantee the payment of all sums payable under the relevant credit facility and such group members are required to grant first-ranking security over their shares or, in certain borrowing groups, over substantially all of their assets to secure the payment of all sums payable thereunder; - In addition to certain mandatory prepayment events, the instructing group of lenders under the relevant credit facility may cancel the commitments thereunder and declare the loans thereunder due and payable after the applicable notice period following the occurrence of a change of control (as specified in the relevant credit facility); - Our credit facilities contain certain customary events of default, the occurrence of which, subject to certain exceptions and materiality qualifications, would allow the instructing group of lenders to (i) cancel the total commitments, (ii) accelerate all outstanding loans and terminate their commitments thereunder and/or (iii) declare that all or part of the loans be payable on demand; - Our credit facilities require members of the relevant borrowing group to observe certain affirmative and negative undertakings and covenants, which are subject to certain materiality qualifications and other customary and agreed exceptions; and - In addition to customary default provisions, our credit facilities generally include certain cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions with respect to other indebtedness of members of the relevant borrowing group, subject to agreed minimum thresholds and other customary and agreed exceptions. _Senior Notes. CWC and Columbus have issued senior notes. In general, our senior notes (i) are senior obligations_ of each respective issuer within the relevant borrowing group that rank equally with all of the existing and future senior debt of such issuer and are senior to all existing and future subordinated debt of each respective issuer within the relevant borrowing group and (ii) contain, in most instances, certain guarantees from other members of the relevant borrowing group (as specified in the applicable indenture). In addition, the indentures governing our senior notes contain certain covenants, the more notable of which are as follows: - Our notes contain certain customary incurrence-based covenants. In addition, our notes provide that any failure to pay principal prior to expiration of any applicable grace period, or any acceleration with respect to other indebtedness of the issuer or certain subsidiaries, over agreed minimum thresholds (as specified under the applicable indenture), is an event of default under the respective notes; - Our notes contain certain restrictions that, among other things, restrict the ability of the members of the relevant borrowing group to (i) incur or guarantee certain financial indebtedness, (ii) make certain disposals and acquisitions, (iii) create certain security interests over their assets, in each case, subject to certain customary and agreed exceptions and (iv) make certain restricted payments to its direct and/or indirect parent companies (and indirectly to CWC or Liberty Global) through dividends, loans or other distributions, subject to compliance with applicable covenants; and F-79 ----- - If the relevant issuer or certain of its subsidiaries (as specified in the applicable indenture) sell certain assets, such issuer must offer to repurchase the applicable notes at par, or if a change of control (as specified in the applicable indenture) occurs, such issuer must offer to repurchase all of the relevant notes at a redemption price of 101%. As of December 31, 2016, Columbus was restricted from incurring additional financial indebtedness. Columbus and Sable (as applicable) may redeem some or all of the Columbus Senior Notes and Sable Senior Notes, respectively, at the following redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of the principal amount) plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts (as specified in the applicable indenture), if any, to the redemption date, as set forth below: In October 2016, Sable and Coral-US entered into an agreement with additional lenders under the CWC Credit Agreement increasing the aggregate commitments under the CWC Revolving Credit Facility from $570 million to $625 million. Other than with respect to the increase in aggregate commitments, the terms of the CWC Revolving Credit Facility were not modified. In November 2016, Sable and Coral-US entered into a new $300.0 million term loan facility (the Term B-1B The details of our deferred tax balances at December 31, 2016 and our deferred tax expense for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 are as follows: The significant components of our net operating loss and other carryforwards and related tax assets at December 31, 2016 are as follows: At December 31, 2016, we had 44,333 authorized and allotted ordinary shares at a nominal value of £1.00. Each share is full voting and had dividend and capital distribution rights. Our fully paid share capital as of December 31, 2016 is as follows: _Asset-liability matching_ During 2008, the Trustees agreed an insurance buy-in of the U.K. pensioner liabilities with Prudential Insurance. The buy-in involved the purchase of a bulk annuity policy by the CWSF under which Prudential Insurance assumed responsibility for the benefits payable to the CWSF’s U.K. pensioners. In December 2011, a further 233 pensioners, having commenced with pensions in payment since the original annuity, were brought within the bulk annuity policy. These pensioner liabilities and the matching annuity policy remain within the CWSF. At December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2016, approximately 60% and 63%, respectively, of the liabilities in the CWSF are matched by the annuity policy asset, which reduces the funding risk for the company. _U.K. unfunded pension arrangements_ We operate unfunded defined benefit arrangements in the U.K. that primarily relate to pension provisions for former Directors and other senior employees in respect of their earnings in excess of the previous Inland Revenue salary cap. These arrangements are governed by individual trust deeds. One arrangement incorporates a covenant requiring us to hold security against the value of the liabilities. The security is in the form of U.K. Government Gilts, which are included in other noncurrent assets on our consolidated statements of financial position as available-for-sale financial assets. The weighted average duration of the expected benefit payments from the unfunded arrangements is 15 years. _Overseas schemes_ We operate other defined benefit pension schemes in Jamaica and Barbados, which are governed by local pension laws and regulations. These defined benefit schemes are closed to new entrants and, in Jamaica, existing participants do not accrue any additional benefits. The Jamaican scheme owns an insurance policy, which matches in full the value of the defined benefit liabilities. When defined benefit funds have an IAS 19, Employee Benefits, (IAS 19) surplus, they are recorded at the lower of that surplus and the future economic benefits available in the form of a cash refund or a reduction in future contributions. Any adjustment to the surplus (net of interest), referred to as an asset ceiling adjustment, is recorded in other comprehensive income. During the nine months ended December 31, 2016 and the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, we recorded asset ceiling adjustments related to the Jamaican scheme of $2.9 million, nil and $26.0 million, respectively. The maximum economic benefit was determined by reference to the reductions in future contributions available to the company. Based on December 31, 2016 exchange rates and information available as of that date, contributions to the overseas defined benefit pension schemes in 2017 are expected to aggregate $3.6 million. _Risk_ Through our defined benefit pension plans, we are exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below. The net pension liability can be significantly influenced by short-term market factors. The calculation of the net surplus or deficit of the respective plans depends on factors which are beyond our control, principally (i) the value at the balance sheet date of equity shares in which the respective scheme has invested and (ii) long-term interest rates, which are used to discount future liabilities. The funding of the respective schemes is based on long-term trends and assumptions relating to market growth, as advised by qualified actuaries and investment advisors, including: - Investment returns: Our net pension assets (liabilities) and contribution requirements are heavily dependent upon the return on the invested assets; - Longevity: The cost to the company of the pensions promised to members is dependent upon the expected term of these payments. To the extent that members live longer than expected this will increase the cost of these arrangements; and - Inflation rate risk: In the U.K., the pension promises are primarily linked to inflation. Accordingly, higher inflation will lead to higher pension liabilities. The above risks have been mitigated for a large proportion of the CWSF and all of the Jamaican scheme’s liabilities through the purchase of insurance policies, the payments from which exactly match the promises made to employees. Remaining investment risks in the CWSF have also been mitigated to a certain extent by diversification of the return-seeking assets. In addition, the defined benefit obligations as measured under IAS 19 are linked to yields on AA rated corporate bonds; however, the majority of our arrangements invest in a number of other assets, which generally move in a different manner from these bonds. Accordingly, changes in market conditions may lead to volatility in the net pension liability, actuarial gains or losses in other comprehensive income (loss), and, to a lesser extent, in the IAS 19 pension expense in our consolidated statements of operations. _Sensitivity analysis_ The following table summarizes the impact a 0.25% increase or decrease in the applicable actuarial assumed rate would have on the valuation of our pension schemes: The sensitivity analysis is based on a standalone change in each assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. As reflected above, the impact on the net pension liability is significantly reduced for the CWSF scheme as a result of the annuity insurance policies we hold. The methods used to prepare the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the prior period. Using the projected unit credit method for the valuation of liabilities, the current service cost is expected to increase when expressed as a percentage of pensionable payroll as the members of the scheme approach retirement. _Pension plan assets and liabilities_ The assets and liabilities of our defined benefit pension schemes are as follows: The costs associated with our pension schemes recognized in our consolidated statements of operations are as follows: Changes in our net pension asset (liability), after application of asset limit, are as follows: Changes in the present value of our defined benefit pension obligations are as follows: Changes in the fair value of defined benefit assets are as follows: Changes in the fair value of our minimum funding requirement or asset ceiling are as follows: We recognized $28.7 million (which includes approximately $20.3 million of expense associated with the accelerated vesting on May 16, 2016), $14.5 million and $6.7 million of share-based compensation expense during the nine months ended December 31, 2016 and the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which is included in employee and other staff expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. _Interest income. Amounts represent interest income on the related-party loans receivable, as further described_ below. The following table provides details of our related-party balances: We have established various defined contribution benefit plans for our and our subsidiaries’ employees. The aggregate expense of our continuing operations for matching contributions under the various defined contribution employee benefit plans was $5.2 million, $5.3 million and $6.5 million during the nine months ended December 31, 2016 and the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In addition to the foregoing items, we have contingent liabilities related to matters arising in the ordinary course of business, including (i) legal proceedings, (ii) issues involving VAT and wage, property, withholding and other tax issues and (iii) disputes over interconnection, programming, copyright and channel carriage fees. While we generally expect that the amounts required to satisfy these contingencies will not materially differ from any estimated amounts we have accrued, no assurance can be given that the resolution of one or more of these contingencies will not result in a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position in any given period. Due, in general, to the complexity of the issues involved and, in certain cases, the lack of a clear basis for predicting outcomes, we cannot provide a meaningful range of potential losses or cash outflows that might result from any unfavorable outcomes.

Such elections are generally irrevocable. For those investments over which we exercise significant influence, we elect the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, investments are recorded at cost and are subsequently increased or reduced to reflect the share of income or losses of the investee, with our recognition of losses generally limited to the extent of our investment in, and advances and commitments to, the investee. Intercompany profits on transactions with equity affiliates for which assets remain on our or our investee’s balance sheet are eliminated to the extent of our ownership interest in the investee. All costs directly associated with the acquisition of an investment to be accounted for using the equity method are included in the carrying amount of the investment. We continually review our equity method investments to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis has occurred. The primary factors we consider in our determination are the operating performance and near-term prospects of the investee, changes in the stock price or valuation subsequent to the balance sheet date, and the impacts of exchange rates, if applicable. If the decline in fair value of an equity method investment is deemed impaired, the cost basis of the security is written down to fair value.

The fair value determination that supported this impairment charge was made using discounted cash flows and precedent transactions methodologies.

The interest rates presented represent stated rates and do not include the impact of derivative instruments, deferred financing costs, original issue premiums or discounts and commitment fees, all of which affect our overall cost of borrowing. Including the effects of derivative instruments, original issue premiums or discounts and commitment fees, but excluding the impact of financing costs, our weighted average interest rate on our aggregate variable- and fixed-rate indebtedness was 7.0% at December 31, 2016. For information regarding our derivative instruments, see note 7. (b) Unused borrowing capacity under the CWC Credit Facilities of $756.5 million includes $625.0 million under the CWC Revolving Credit Facility (as defined and described below), which represents the maximum availability without regard to covenant compliance calculations or other conditions precedent to this borrowing At December 31, 2016, based on the applicable leverage and other financial covenants, which take into account the £100.0 million ($123.5 million) letters of credit associated with the CWSF (as defined and described in note 20), $612.5 million of unused borrowing capacity was available to be borrowed under the CWC Credit Facilities. When the relevant December 31, 2016 compliance reporting requirements have been completed, and assuming no changes from December 31, 2016 borrowing levels, we anticipate that $612.5 million of unused borrowing capacity under the CWC Credit Facilities will continue to be available to be borrowed. (c) The estimated fair values of our debt instruments are determined using the average of applicable bid and ask prices (mostly Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy) or, when quoted market prices are unavailable or not considered indicative of fair value, discounted cash flow models (mostly Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy). The discount rates used in the cash flow models are based on the market interest rates and estimated credit spreads of the applicable entity, to the extent available, and other relevant factors.

In this regard, we have entered into various derivative instruments to manage interest rate exposure and foreign currency exposure with respect to the U.S. dollar, the British pound sterling (£) and the Jamaican dollar (JMD). Hedge accounting is not applied to our cross-currency and interest rate swaps.

(b) We consider credit risk in our fair value assessments. As of December 31, 2016, (i) the fair values of our cross-currency and interest rate derivative contracts that represented assets have been reduced by credit risk valuation adjustments aggregating $0.7 million and (ii) the fair values of our cross-currency and interest rate derivative contracts that represented liabilities have been reduced by credit risk valuation adjustments aggregating $2.9 million. The adjustments to our derivative assets relate to the credit risk associated with counterparty nonperformance, and the adjustments to our derivative liabilities relate to credit risk associated with our own nonperformance. In all cases, the adjustments take into account offsetting liability or asset positions within a given contract. Our determination of credit risk valuation adjustments generally is based on our and our counterparties’ credit risks, as observed in the credit default swap market and market quotations for certain of our subsidiaries’ debt instruments, as applicable. The changes in the credit risk valuation adjustments associated with our cross-currency and interest rate derivative contracts resulted in a net gain of $2.2 million during the nine months ended December 31, 2016. This amount is included in realized and unrealized losses on derivative instruments within finance expense in our consolidated statements of operations.

Based on historic default rates, we believe that no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade and other receivables not past due. Due to the nature of the telecommunications industry, balances relating to interconnection with other carriers often have lengthy settlement periods. Generally, interconnection agreements with major carriers result in both receivables and payables balances with the same counterparty. Industry practice is that receivable and payable amounts relating to interconnection revenue and costs for a defined period are agreed between counterparties and settled on a net basis.

For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows, known as cash-generating units. We have principally determined our cash-generating units to be the country in which the business operates with the exception of those segments that have discrete service lines and cash inflows, which are monitored by management on that basis. We performed our annual impairment review effective October 1, 2016. In performing the review, the recoverable amounts of the cash-generating unit was determined based on the fair value less costs of disposal, estimated using the business enterprise value of the respective cash-generating unit. The fair value measurement was categorized as Level 3 fair value based on the inputs in the valuation technique used. The business enterprise value for each cash-generating unit was estimated using discounting cash flows, which used discount rates dependent on the weighted average cost of capital of the respective cash-generating unit. In connection with our annual impairment analysis, we impaired the value of goodwill in our Trinidad and Tobago and Networks cashgenerating units by $586.7 million and $115.9 million, respectively.

The terminal growth rate reflects a normalized level based on the tenth year in the model, consistent with the assumptions that a market participant would make. Our impairment review results of the recoverable amounts of our cash-generating units are sensitive to a number of assumptions, including those key assumptions noted in the table above. We do not believe a reasonably possible change, in isolation, of any of the key assumptions would cause the carrying values of the cashgenerating units not deemed impaired to exceed their respective business enterprise value. If, among other factors, (i) our enterprise value or Liberty Global’s equity values were to decline significantly or (ii) the adverse impacts of economic, competitive, regulatory or other factors were to cause our results of operations or cash flows to be worse than anticipated, we could conclude in future periods that further impairment charges are required in order to reduce the carrying values of our goodwill and, to a lesser extent, other long-lived assets.

(b) Amounts reflect adjustments (either an increase or a decrease) to “expected” tax benefit (loss) for statutory rates in jurisdictions in which we operate outside of the U.K. During 2015, the U.K. enacted legislation that will change the corporate income tax rate from the current rate of 20.0% to 19.0% in April 2017 and 18.0% in April 2020. During the third quarter of 2016, the U.K. enacted legislation that will further reduce the corporate income tax rate in April 2020 from 18.0% to 17.0%. Due to our unrecognized deferred tax assets in the U.K., these U.K. statutory rate changes are not expected to significantly impact our deferred income taxes.

The CWSF has been closed to new defined benefit members since 1998 and was closed to future accrual of benefits effective from March 31, 2016. _Regulatory framework and governance_ U.K. regulations govern (i) the nature of the relationship between CWC and the CWSF Board of Trustees (the",N/A,as_expected,2017,928

Responsibility for the,449.219.1,,"governance of the CWSF, including investment decisions and contribution schedules, lies with the Trustees who must consult with the company on such matters. In accordance with the CWSF’s governing documents, the Trustees must be composed of representatives of the company, plan participants and an independent trustee. The weighted average duration of the total expected benefit payments from the CWSF is 15 years, and the weighted average duration of the expected uninsured benefit payments from the CWSF is 20 years. We made contributions of $44.3 million, $48.8 million and $51.4 million during the nine months ended December 31, 2016 and the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, to the CWSF. We are party to a contingent funding agreement (the Contingent Funding Arrangement) with the Trustees, under which the Trustees can call for a letter of credit or cash escrow in certain circumstances, such as a breach of certain financial covenants, the incurrence of secured debt above an agreed level or the failure to maintain available commitments of at least $150 million under the CWC Revolving Credit Facility. Our acquisition of Columbus constituted a “change of control” under the Contingent Funding Arrangement and, therefore, the Trustees have the right to drawdown on the £100.0 million ($123.5 million) letters of credit that were put in place in connection with the acquisition of Columbus pursuant to the terms of the Contingent Funding Arrangement. Based on the pending outcome of the triennial actuarial valuation as of March 31, 2016, which is expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2017, our contributions necessary to fund the CWSF by April 2019 are currently expected to range from nil to $28.4 million per year during 2017, 2018 and 2019. We are currently in negotiations with the Trustees with respect to the future funding requirements of the CWSF and the outstanding letters of credit with a view to addressing the remaining deficit through future contributions over a period of time similar in structure to prior triennial period contribution schedules. No assurance can be given as to the outcome of such negotiations. _Minimum funding requirement_ The deficit recovery funding plan agreed with the Trustees as part of the March 2013 actuarial valuation constitutes a minimum funding requirement. An adjustment to the deficit in the CWSF to account for the minimum funding requirement has been calculated in accordance with IFRIC 14, The Limits on a Defined Benefit _Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction. The adjustment to the deficit, which is recorded in_ other comprehensive loss, was $10.1 million, $54.3 million and $21.4 million during the nine months ended December 31, 2016 and the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Programming commitments consist of obligations associated with certain of our programming and sports rights contracts that are enforceable and legally binding on us as we have agreed to pay minimum fees without regard to (i) the actual number of subscribers to the programming services, (ii) whether we terminate service to a portion of our subscribers or dispose of a portion of our distribution systems or (iii) whether we discontinue our premium sports services. In addition, programming commitments do not include increases in future periods associated with contractual inflation or other price adjustments that are not fixed. Accordingly, the amounts reflected in the above table with respect to these contracts are significantly less than the amounts we expect to pay in these periods under these contracts. Historically, payments to programming vendors have represented a significant portion of our operating costs, and we expect that this will continue to be the case in future periods. Programming costs in our consolidated statements of operations include the amortization of certain programming rights in certain of our markets. Network and connectivity commitments include our domestic network service agreements with certain other telecommunications companies. The amounts reflected in the above table with respect to these commitments represent fixed minimum amounts payable under these agreements and, therefore, may be less than the actual amounts we ultimately pay in these periods. Purchase commitments include unconditional and legally binding obligations related to (i) the purchase of customer premises and other equipment and (ii) certain service-related commitments, including call center, information technology and maintenance services. In addition to the commitments set forth in the table above, we have significant commitments under (i) derivative instruments and (ii) defined benefit plans and similar agreements, pursuant to which we expect to make payments in future periods. For information regarding our derivative instruments, including the net cash paid or received in connection with these instruments during the nine months ended December 31, 2016 and the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, see note 7. For information regarding our defined benefit plans, see note 20. Rental expense of our continuing operations under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements amounted to $38.8 million, $83.2 million and $39.4 million during the nine months ended December 31, 2016 and the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. It is expected that in the normal course of business, finance leases that expire generally will be renewed or replaced by similar leases. F-106 -----",N/A,as_expected,2017,928
952_1,Offerings 2017.md,449,LIABILITIES,449.271,(28) Segment Reporting,449.271.1,,"Generally, we identify our segments on a geographical basis and, in certain cases, on a product basis. Each country in which we operate is generally treated as an operating segment. The aggregation of operating segments into their reporting segments reflects (i) the similar economic and regulatory characteristics within each of those segments, (ii) the similar nature of its products and services and (iii) its customers. In certain cases, we may elect to include an operating segment in our segment disclosure that does not meet the above-described criteria for a reportable segment. We evaluate performance and make decisions about allocating resources to our operating segments based on financial measures such as revenue and Adjusted Segment EBITDA (as defined below). In addition, we review non-financial measures such as subscriber growth, as appropriate. “EBITDA” is defined as profit before net financial expense, income taxes and depreciation, amortization and impairment. As we use the term, “Adjusted Segment EBITDA” is defined as EBITDA before share-based compensation, provisions and provision releases related to significant litigation and other operating items. Other operating items include (i) gains and losses on the disposition of long-lived assets, (ii) third-party costs directly associated with successful and unsuccessful acquisitions and dispositions, including legal, advisory and due diligence fees, as applicable, (iii) other acquisition-related items, such as gains and losses on the settlement of contingent consideration, (iv) restructuring provisions or provision releases and (v) share of results of joint ventures and associates. Our internal decision makers believe Adjusted Segment EBITDA is a meaningful measure because it represents a transparent view of our recurring operating performance that is unaffected by our capital structure and allows management to (a) readily view operating trends, (b) perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between segments and (c) identify strategies to improve operating performance in the different countries in which we operate. A reconciliation of total Adjusted Segment EBITDA to our earnings (loss) from continuing operations is presented below. We have five reportable segments that provide mobile, fixed-line telephony, broadband internet, video and managed services to residential and business customers. As of December 31, 2016, our reportable segments are as follows: - The Caribbean - Panama - BTC - Networks and LatAm - Seychelles Our reportable segments set forth above, other than Networks and LatAM, derive their revenue primarily from communications services, including mobile, fixed-line telephony, broadband internet, video and B2B services. Our Networks and LatAm segment primarily derives its revenue from broadband connectivity solutions to businesses and government institutions. At December 31, 2016, our operating segments provide broadband communications and other services in over 30 countries, primarily in the Caribbean and Latin America.

(b) Subscription revenue includes amounts received from subscribers for ongoing services, excluding installation fees and late fees. Subscription revenue from subscribers who purchase bundled services at a discounted rate is generally allocated proportionally to each service based on the standalone price for each individual service. As a result, changes in the standalone pricing of our cable and mobile products or the composition of bundles can contribute to changes in our product revenue categories from period to period. (c) Other revenue includes, among other items, managed services, wholesale, interconnect and mobile handset sales revenue. Revenue by major category for the year ended March 31, 2015 is not provided due to system limitations, which makes it impracticable to accurately reflect such categories on a comparable basis to the current period presentation.
