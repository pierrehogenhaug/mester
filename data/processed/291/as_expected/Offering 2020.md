memorandum may be lawfully delivered in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which you are located and you may not, nor are you authorized to,
deliver the offering memorandum to any other person.

The materials relating to the offering do not constitute, and may not be used in connection with, an offer or solicitation in any place where offers or
solicitations are not permitted by law. If a jurisdiction requires that the offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and an Initial Purchaser or any
affiliate of an Initial Purchaser is a licensed broker or dealer in that jurisdiction, the offering shall be deemed to be made by such Initial Purchaser or such
affiliate on behalf of Vertical Midco GmbH, Vertical Holdco GmbH and Vertical U.S. Newco Inc. (collectively, the “Issuers”) in such jurisdiction. Under no
circumstances shall the offering memorandum constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of, these securities
in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.

The offering memorandum has not been approved by an authorized person in the United Kingdom and is for distribution only to persons who (i) have
professional experience in matters relating to investments (being investment professionals falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets
Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (as amended, the “Financial Promotion Order”)), (ii) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (“high net
worth companies, unincorporated associations, etc.”) of the Financial Promotion Order, (iii) are outside the United Kingdom or (iv) are persons to whom an
invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) in connection
with the issue or sale of any securities may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to
as “relevant persons”). This offering memorandum is directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not relevant
persons. Any investment or investment activity to which this offering memorandum relates is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only
with relevant persons. No part of this offering memorandum should be published, reproduced, distributed or otherwise made available in whole or in part to
any other person.

No person may communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21
of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the securities other than in circumstances in which
Section 21(1) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 does not apply to us.

The offering memorandum has been sent to you in electronic form. You are reminded that documents transmitted via this medium may be altered or changed
during the process of electronic transmission and consequently none of the Initial Purchasers, any person who controls the Initial Purchasers, the Issuers, or
the Guarantors (as defined in the offering memorandum), nor any of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents or affiliates of the foregoing
entities or persons, accepts any liability or responsibility whatsoever in respect of any difference between the offering memorandum distributed to you in
electronic form and the hard copy version available to you on request from the Initial Purchasers.

Notwithstanding the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union, any references in this document to European Union law should be treated as
references to such law as applies in England and Wales from time to time including as retained, amended, extended, re-enacted or otherwise given effect on
or after 11:00 pm on January 31, 2020.

**Professional investors and ECPs only target market: Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of the manufacturers, the target market**
assessment in respect of the securities described in the offering memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such securities is
eligible counterparties (“ECPs”) and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels for
distribution of such securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending
such securities (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is
responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market
assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**Prohibition of sales to EEA or United Kingdom retail investors: The securities described in the offering memorandum are not intended to be offered,**
sold or otherwise made available to and should not be made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in
the EEA or the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of
Article 4(1) of MiFID II); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU, as amended, where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No
1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or
the United Kingdom has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA
or the United Kingdom may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

should not rely on any such information. You should assume that the information contained in this offering
memorandum is accurate only as of the date on the front of this offering memorandum or otherwise as of the date

the Notes in any jurisdiction in which such offer or invitation is not authorized or to any person to whom it is
unlawful to make such an offer or invitation. No action has been, or will be, taken to permit a public offering in
any jurisdiction where action would be required for that purpose. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or
sold, directly or indirectly, and this offering memorandum may not be distributed, in any jurisdiction except in
accordance with the legal requirements applicable in such jurisdiction. You must comply with all laws that apply

You should be aware that you may be required to bear the financial risks of this investment for an indefinite
period of time. None of the Issuers, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers are making an offer to sell the Notes
in any jurisdiction where the offer and sale of the Notes is prohibited. Neither the Issuers nor any Guarantor
makes any representation to you that the Notes are a legal investment for you. No action has been, or will be,
taken to permit a public offering in any jurisdiction where action would be required for that purpose.

None of the Issuers, the Guarantors, the Group, the Sponsors or the Initial Purchasers or any of their respective
representatives are providing you with any legal, business, tax or other advice in this offering memorandum. You

memorandum and have had an opportunity to request, and have received all additional information that you need
from us. No person is authorized in connection with any offering made pursuant to this offering memorandum to
give any information or to make any representation not contained in this offering memorandum or any pricing
term sheet or supplement and, if given or made, any other information or representation must not be relied upon
as having been authorized by the Issuers, the Group, the Sponsors or the Initial Purchasers. Neither the Trustee,
the Security Agent, any Paying Agent, any Registrar, any Transfer Agent nor any other agent acting with respect
to the Notes is responsible for the contents of this offering memorandum or expresses any opinion as to the
merits of the Notes under this offering memorandum.

The information contained in this offering memorandum is accurate as of the date hereof. The Issuers’ and the
Guarantors’ business, financial condition or other information contained in this offering memorandum may
change after the date hereof. Neither the delivery of this offering memorandum at any time after the date of
publication nor any subsequent commitment to purchase the Notes shall, under any circumstances, create an
implication that there has been no change in the information set out in this offering memorandum or in our
business since the date of this offering memorandum.

None of the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Security Agent, the Paying Agents, the Registrars, the Transfer
Agents, the Group, the Sponsors or any other agent acting with respect to the Notes accept responsibility for and
make no representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the information set
out in this offering memorandum and nothing contained in this offering memorandum is, or should be relied
upon as, a promise or representation by the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Security Agent, or any other agent
acting with respect to the Notes as to the past or the future. By receiving this offering memorandum, you
acknowledge that you have not relied on the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Security Agent, any Paying
Agent, any Registrar, any Transfer Agent, the Group, the Sponsors or their respective directors, affiliates,
advisers and agents in connection with your investigation of the accuracy of this information or your decision
whether to invest in the Notes. The Initial Purchasers disclaim all and any liability whether arising in tort,
contract or otherwise which they may otherwise have in relation to this offering memorandum or any information
contained herein. The Initial Purchasers do not undertake to review the financial condition or affairs of the
Issuers or any Guarantor during the life of the Notes or to advise any investor or potential investor in the Notes of
any information coming to the attention of any Initial Purchaser. Nothing contained in this Offering
Memorandum is, or shall be relied upon as, a promise or representation by any of the Initial Purchasers as to the
past or future.

We reserve the right to withdraw the Offering at any time. We and the Initial Purchasers each reserve the right to
reject any offer to purchase the Notes in whole or in part and to allot to any prospective purchaser less than the
amount of the Notes sought by it. The Initial Purchasers and certain of their respective related entities may
acquire, for their own accounts, a portion of the Notes.

This offering memorandum is a confidential document that we are providing only to prospective purchasers of
the Notes and has only been prepared in connection with the Offering. You must not make copies of any part of
this offering memorandum or give a copy of it to any other person, or disclose any information in this offering
memorandum to any other person.

By accepting delivery of this offering memorandum, you agree to the foregoing and agree not to use any
information herein for any purpose other than considering an investment in the Notes. This offering
memorandum may be used only for the purpose for which it was published.

The Notes will be available in book-entry form only. The Issuers expect that the Notes offered and sold in the
United States to qualified institutional buyers in reliance upon Rule 144A will initially be represented by
beneficial interests in one or more permanent global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached
(the “Rule 144A Global Notes”). The Issuers expect that the Notes offered and sold outside the United States to
non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S will initially be represented by beneficial interests in one or more
temporary global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Temporary Regulation S
Global Notes”). Interests in the Temporary Regulation S Global Notes will be exchangeable for interests in one
or more corresponding permanent Regulation S global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached
and with denominations equal to the aggregate principal amount of the corresponding Temporary Regulation S
Global Notes (the “Permanent Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the Temporary Regulation S
Global Notes, the “Regulation S Global Notes”) not earlier than the later of (i) the “distribution compliance
period” as defined in Regulation S (which shall be the period through and including the 40th day after the closing
of the Offering) and (ii) the first day on which certification on non-U.S. ownership is provided to the Trustee as
described under “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form—Transfers.”

The information set out in relation to sections of this Offering Memorandum describing clearing and settlement
arrangements, including the section entitled “Book Entry, Delivery and Form,” is subject to any change in or
reinterpretation of the rules, regulations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream currently in effect. We
will not, nor will any of our agents, have responsibility for the performance of the respective obligations of DTC,
Euroclear and Clearstream or their respective participants under the rules and procedures governing their
operations, nor will we or our agents have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to,
or payments made on account of, book entry interests held through the facilities of any clearing system or for
maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to these book entry interests. Investors wishing to use

these clearing systems are advised to confirm the continued applicability of their rules, regulations and
procedures.

permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the Notes
will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that permission to deal in the Notes will be granted or that
such listing will be maintained, and settlement of the Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing. Any
investor or potential investor in the EEA should not base any investment decision relating to the Notes on the
information contained in this Offering Memorandum after publication of the listing particulars and should refer
instead to those listing particulars.

**NOTICE TO CERTAIN INVESTORS**

**United States**

None of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, any state securities commission or any other regulatory
authority has reviewed or approved or disapproved of the Notes or the Note Guarantees, and none of the
foregoing authorities have passed upon or endorsed the merits of the Offering or the accuracy or adequacy of this
offering memorandum. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense under the laws of the United
States and could be a criminal offense in certain other jurisdictions.

Each purchaser of the Notes will be deemed to have made the representations, warranties and acknowledgements
that are described in this offering memorandum under “Transfer Restrictions.” The Notes have not been and will
not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any state of the United States and are subject
to certain restrictions on transfer. Prospective purchasers are hereby notified that the seller of any note may be
relying on the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act provided by Rule 144A. For a
description of certain further restrictions on resale or transfer of the Notes, see “Transfer Restrictions.”

**Canada**

This offering memorandum constitutes an “exempt offering document” as defined in and for the purposes of
applicable Canadian securities laws. No prospectus has been filed with any securities commission or similar
regulatory authority in Canada in connection with the offer and sale of the Notes. No securities commission or
similar regulatory authority in Canada has reviewed or in any way passed upon this document or on the merits of
the Notes and any representation to the contrary is an offence.

The Notes may be sold only to Canadian purchasers purchasing, or deemed to be purchasing, as principal that are
“accredited investors”, as such term is defined in Section 1.1 of National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus
Exemptions or, in Ontario, as such term is defined in Section 73.3(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario), and are
“permitted clients”, as such term is defined in section 1.1 of National Instrument 31-103 Registration
Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations. Each Canadian purchaser who purchases the
Notes will be deemed to have represented to the Issuers, the Initial Purchasers and to each dealer from whom a
purchase confirmation is received, as applicable, that the purchaser (i) is purchasing as principal, or is deemed to
be purchasing as principal in accordance with applicable Canadian securities laws, for investment only and not
with a view to resale or redistribution; (ii) is an “accredited investor”; and (iii) is a “permitted client”.

Any resale of Notes acquired by a Canadian purchaser in the Offering must be made in accordance with
applicable Canadian securities laws, which may vary depending on the relevant jurisdiction, and which may
require resales to be made in accordance with Canadian prospectus requirements, a statutory exemption from the
prospectus requirements, in a transaction exempt from the prospectus requirements or otherwise under a
discretionary exemption from the prospectus requirements granted by the applicable local Canadian securities
regulatory authority. These resale restrictions may under certain circumstances apply to resales of the Notes
outside of Canada.

Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser with remedies for
rescission or damages if this offering memorandum (including any amendment thereto) contains a
misrepresentation, provided that the remedies for rescission or damages are exercised by the purchaser within the
time limit prescribed by the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory. The purchaser should
refer to any applicable provisions of the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory for
particulars of these rights, or consult with a legal advisor.

Canadian purchasers are advised that this document has been prepared in reliance on Section 3A.3 of National
Instrument 33-105 Underwriting Conflicts (“NI 33-105”). Pursuant to section 3A.3 of NI 33-105, this document
is exempt from the requirement that the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers in the Offering provide Canadian
purchasers with certain conflicts of interest disclosure pertaining to “connected issuer” and/or “related issuer”
relationships as would otherwise be required pursuant to subsection 2.1(1) of NI 33-105.

Upon receipt of this offering memorandum, each Canadian purchaser hereby confirms that it has expressly
requested that all documents evidencing or relating in any way to the sale of the Notes described herein
(including for greater certainty any purchase confirmation or any notice) be drawn up in the English language
only. Par la réception de ce document, chaque investisseur Canadien confirme par les présentes qu’il a
_expressément exigé que tous les documents faisant foi ou se rapportant de quelque manière que ce soit à la vente_
_des valeurs mobilières décrites aux présentes (incluant, pour plus de certitude, toute confirmation d’achat ou_
_tout avis) soient rédigés en anglais seulement._

**European Economic Area and the UK**

**_Prohibition of Sales to EEA or UK Retail Investors_**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or
otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA or the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a retail
investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of
MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended or superseded, the
“Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in
point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU)
No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them
available to retail investors in the EEA or the United Kingdom has been prepared and therefore offering or
selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA or the United Kingdom
may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any Member State of the
EEA or the United Kingdom that is subject to Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 14 June 2017 (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”) will be made pursuant to an exemption
under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the Notes.

Notwithstanding the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union, any references in this offering
memorandum to European Union law should be treated as references to such law as applies in England and
Wales from time to time including as retained, amended, extended, re-enacted or otherwise given effect on or
after 11:00 pm on January 31, 2020.

**_MiFID II Product Governance_**

Solely for the purposes of the manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect
of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and
professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to
eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or
recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market
assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market
assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment)
and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**Germany**

The Offering is not a public offering in the Federal Republic of Germany. The Notes may not be offered and sold
in the Federal Republic of Germany except in accordance with the provisions of the Securities Prospectus Act of
the Federal Republic of Germany (Wertpapierprospektgesetz) (as amended, the “German Securities Prospectus
Act”), the Prospectus Regulation and any other laws applicable in Germany. This offering memorandum has not
been and will not be submitted to, nor has it been nor will it be approved by, the German Federal Financial
Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht) (“BaFin”). BaFin has not obtained and
will not obtain a notification from another competent authority of a member state of the European Union (each a
Member State), with which a securities prospectus may have been filed, pursuant to Article 25 of the Prospectus
Regulation. The Notes must not be distributed within Germany by way of a public offer, public advertisement or
in any similar manner, and this offering memorandum and any other document relating to the Notes, as well as
information contained therein, may not be supplied to the public in Germany or used in connection with any offer
for subscription of Notes to the public in Germany. Consequently, in Germany the Notes will only be available
to, and this offering memorandum and any other offering material in relation to the Notes is directed only at,
persons who are qualified investors (qualifizierte Anleger) within the meaning of Section 2 No. 3 of the German
Securities Prospectus Act in connection with Article 2 lit. e of the Prospectus Regulation. Any resale of the Notes
in Germany may only be made in accordance with the German Securities Prospectus Act, the Prospectus
Regulation and other applicable laws.

**United Kingdom**

This offering memorandum is for distribution only to persons who (i) have professional experience in matters
relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial
Promotion) Order 2005 (as amended, the “Financial Promotion Order”), (ii) are persons falling within
Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (“high net worth companies, unincorporated associations etc.”) of the Financial Promotion

Order, (iii) are outside the United Kingdom or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in
investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) in
connection with the issue or sale of any Notes may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be
communicated (all such persons together being referred to as “Relevant Persons”). This offering memorandum is
directed only at Relevant Persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not Relevant Persons.
Any investment or investment activity to which this offering memorandum relates is permitted only by Relevant
Persons and will be engaged in only with Relevant Persons.

**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This offering memorandum contains forward-looking statements, including statements about market
consolidation and our strategy, investment program, future operations, prospects, growth, goals, targets, industry
forecasts, expected acquisitions, transactions and investments, and target levels of liquidity, leverage and
indebtedness. Forward-looking statements provide our current expectations, intentions or forecasts of future
events. Forward-looking statements include statements about expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, intentions,
assumptions and other statements that are not statements of historical fact. Words or phrases such as “aim,”
“anticipate,” “assume,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “guidance,” “intend,”
“may,” “ongoing,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “seek,” “should,” “target,” “will,” “would” or similar
words or phrases, or the negatives of those words or phrases, may identify forward-looking statements, but the
absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking.

Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors and are
based on potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
expected or implied by the forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those
expected in our forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the factors described in “Risk Factors.”
In addition, even if our actual results are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this
offering memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in
subsequent periods. For example, factors that could cause our actual results to vary from projected future results
include, but are not limited to:

- operating within a highly competitive industry, including the resulting pricing pressure on our business;

- our ability to respond to evolving market trends with innovative products and services on competitive terms;

- the outbreak of COVID-19 and its global economic impact;

- our ability to adjust our personnel and production capacity in line with demand for our products and
services;

- the incurrence of significant costs, including from warranty and product liability claims, due to products that
do not meet customer specifications or that contain defects or errors;

- our ability to comply with a range of different legal and regulatory requirements worldwide, and the
significant costs and liabilities which could result from non-compliance;

- global and regional economic conditions;

- the imposition of protectionist measures, including tariffs and other barriers to trade;

- our dependence on third-party suppliers, contractors and distributors;

- our ability to achieve the targeted benefits from restructuring and operational improvement measures;

- project management and execution risks in connection with our New Installation business;

- the price and availability of high-quality raw materials, parts and components;

- unforeseen business interruptions at production facilities or other operational problems;

- risks relating to public sector contracts and non-compliance with regulations on public procurement;

- our failure to successfully identify, enter into or integrate acquisitions and/or successfully execute disposals;

- our exposure to foreign exchange translation and transaction risks;

- risks related to our international operations;

- legal disputes and government proceedings in which we are currently, or in the future may be, involved;

- antitrust regulation and related enforcement actions and damage claims;

- the imposition of tax adjustments for greater taxation of profits by tax authorities;

- transfer price risks in connection with our operating activities;

- our dependence on good relationships with our employees and their trade unions as well as employee
representative bodies and stakeholders;

- our ability to attract, hire, train and retain experienced management and personnel;

viii


-----

- impairment of the value of goodwill, brand names or other intangible assets;

- our substantial pension and other similar employee benefits-related obligations, including the development
of these obligations and related funding requirements;

- the sufficiency of our insurance coverage and increases to our insurance premiums;

- our reliance on complex information technology systems and networks that are subject to the risk of
disruption and security breaches;

- our ability to comply with various laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, health
and safety worldwide, and the significant costs and liabilities which could result from non-compliance;

- our ability to comply with sanctions, anti-corruption and money-laundering laws and regulations;

- the adequacy of our internal controls, procedures, compliance systems and risk management systems to
prevent and discover previous or future breaches of laws and regulations and generally to manage risks;

- our ability to adequately protect our intellectual property and know-how or any infringement of third-party
intellectual property;

- regulatory and legal risks relating to data protection;

- the complexity of applicable tax laws, and changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax position;

- tax risks that could arise in particular as a result of tax audits or past measures;

- risks related to the Transactions, our capital structure and the Notes; and

- other factors discussed under “Risk Factors.”

These risks are not exhaustive. Other sections of this offering memorandum describe additional factors that could
adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and liquidity and developments in the markets and
industries in which we operate. New risks can emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all
such risks, nor can we assess the impact of all such risks on our business or the extent to which any risks, or
combination of risks and other factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any
forward-looking statements.

Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual
results. We urge you to read this entire offering memorandum, including the sections entitled, “Risk Factors”,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, “Industry” and
“Business” for a more complete discussion of the factors that could affect our future performance and the
industry in which we operate.

Any forward-looking statements are only made as at the date of this offering memorandum, and we do not
intend, and do not assume any obligation, to update forward-looking statements set out in this offering
memorandum. You should interpret all subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us
or to persons acting on our behalf as being qualified by the cautionary statements in this offering memorandum.
As a result, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

We operate in the elevator and escalator and access solutions industries. In certain cases, it is difficult in this
sector to obtain precise market, economic and industry information. Certain information used in this offering
memorandum has been obtained from FactSet’s financial data and analytics; IHS Markit’s “Global Construction
Outlook: Executive Overview” dated March 2020; The Freedonia Group’s “Global Elevator Equipment and
Services by Product, Market and Region” dated July 2017; Oxford Economics’s “Country Economic Forecasts”
dated September 2019; The Economist Intelligence Unit’s “Country Data” dated May 2019 ([©] reproduced with
permission of the Economist Intelligence Unit), and third party and the Target’s analysis and estimates (together,
the “Market Position Analysis”) and services commissioned from the Boston Consulting Group (“Market Size/
Growth Analysis”).

Some of the information herein has also been extrapolated from market data, reports, surveys and studies using
our experience and internal estimates. Elsewhere in this offering memorandum, statements regarding the industry
in which we operate, our position in this industry and the size of certain markets are based solely on our
experience, internal studies, estimates and surveys, and our own investigation of market conditions.

None of the Issuers, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers accepts responsibility for the factual correctness of
any such statistics or information obtained from third parties. While the Issuers believe this information to be
reliable, it has not been independently verified, and we do not make any representation or warranty as to the
accuracy or completeness of such information set forth in this offering memorandum. Any forward-looking
statements contained in such industry and market data were made prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19
pandemic and have not been updated to account for the impact of such outbreak. There can be no assurance that
such forward-looking statements would not have been materially different if the COVID-19 pandemic had been
taken into account. See ‘‘Forward-looking Statements’’. Market data and statistics are inherently predictive and
subject to uncertainty and not necessarily reflective of actual market conditions. Such statistics are based on
market research, which itself is based on sampling and subjective judgments by both the researchers and the
respondents, including judgments about what types of products and transactions should be included in the
relevant market. Additionally, industry publications and reports from management consultants generally state
that the information contained therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but that the
accuracy and completeness of such information is not guaranteed and in some instances state that they do not
assume liability for such information. We cannot therefore assure you of the accuracy and completeness of such
information as we have not independently verified such information.

The Group owns or has rights to certain trademarks, trade names or service marks that it uses in connection with
the operation of its business. The Group asserts, to the fullest extent under applicable law, its rights to its
trademarks, trade names and service marks. Each trademark, trade name or service mark of any other company

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

**The Issuers**

The SUN Issuer and the EUR SSN Issuer were each incorporated on February 11, 2020, and the USD SSN Issuer
was incorporated on April 14, 2020, in each case to facilitate the Transactions. As of the date of this offering
memorandum, the Issuers have no material assets or liabilities, do not have any revenue-generating activities of
their own and have not engaged in activities other than those related to their incorporation and in preparation of
the Transactions. As a result, no historical financial information of the Issuers is included in this offering
memorandum.

**Elevator Technology Business**

The Elevator Technology Business did not exist as a separate group prior to December 31, 2019. It formed part
of a larger group of companies controlled by thyssenkrupp AG and was reported as a segment within the
consolidated financial statements of thyssenkrupp AG. In order to facilitate the Acquisition, all companies and
operating activities that are part of the Elevator Technology Business were transferred, directly or indirectly, to
the Target in a corporate reorganization that was completed on December 31, 2019 (the “Reorganization”).

All historical financial information presented in this offering memorandum is that of the Elevator Technology
Business. When referring to the “Elevator Technology Business,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Group” in respect of
such financial information, we mean (i) prior to the completion of the Reorganization on December 31, 2019, the
“Elevator Technology Business” as defined in our Audited Combined Financial Statements (as defined below)
and (ii) after the Reorganization, the “thyssenkrupp Elevator Technology Group” as defined in our Unaudited
Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (as defined below) or the business carried out by the “thyssenkrupp
Elevator Technology Group,” as the context requires. The financial information as of and for the six months
ended March 31, 2019 and 2020 gives effect to the Reorganization as if it had occurred at the beginning of the
periods presented.

There are important differences between the Elevator Technology Business as presented in the Audited
Combined Financials as of and for the financial years ended September 30, 2017, 2018 and 2019 and the
business carried out by the Target and its subsidiaries as presented in the Unaudited Interim Consolidated
Financial Statements as of and for the six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2020. See “—Basis of Preparation”
and our Financial Statements included elsewhere herein.

**Historical Financial Information**

As the Elevator Technology Business did not exist as a separate group and since all companies and operating
activities within the Elevator Technology Business were under the common control of thyssenkrupp AG, in each
case, prior to the Reorganization, the financial information presented as of and for the financial years ended
September 30, 2017, 2018 and 2019 has been prepared on a combined basis. Effective with the Reorganization,
the Elevator Technology Business came into existence as a separate group and therefore, the financial
information presented for the Target and its consolidated subsidiaries as of and for the six months ended March
31, 2019 and 2020 was prepared on a consolidated basis. As a result, this offering memorandum presents the
following financial information of the Group (the “Financial Statements”):

- The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of the Target and its consolidated subsidiaries as of
and for the six months ended March 31, 2020, including comparative information for the six months ended
March 31, 2019 (the “Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements”), which were prepared in
accordance with International Accounting Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting; and

- The audited combined financial statements of the Elevator Technology Business as of and for the financial
years ended September 30, 2017, 2018 and 2019 (the “Audited Combined Financial Statements”), which
were prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the EU
(“IFRS”), have been audited in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (“ISA”) by
PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Friedrich-List-Straße 20, 45128 Essen,
Federal Republic of Germany (“PwC”), independent auditors, who issued an independent auditor’s report
thereon.

The independent auditor’s report on the Audited Combined Financial Statements is qualified due to issues
regarding local book keeping and financial reporting processes, which led to qualified, adverse or disclaimer of
opinions on the financial information of certain entities of the Elevator Technology Business’s Operating Unit
Spanish Latin America (as defined in the Financial Statements). Due to these issues, PwC was unable to obtain
sufficient information and evidence required to assess the existence, completeness, valuation and cut-off of the

xvii


-----

assets and liabilities as well as the income and expense of these subsidiaries and, as a result, was unable to
determine whether any adjustments might have been necessary in respect of the combined financial position as of
September 30, 2018 and 2017 and the combined statements of profit and loss, comprehensive income and
changes in equity or net cash flows as reported in the combined statement of cash flows for the financial years
ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 (see Note 1 of the Audited Combined Financial Statements). The
auditor’s qualification does not pertain to the combined statement of financial position as of September 30, 2019
included in the Audited Combined Financial Statements. The independent auditor’s report also contains an
emphasis of matter paragraph that the Elevator Technology Business has not operated as a separate stand-alone
group of entities and that the Audited Combined Financial Statements are, therefore, not necessarily indicative of
the results that would have occurred if the Elevator Technology Business had operated as a separate standalone
group of entities during the years presented or for any future period.

In the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements, the issues relating to the Elevator Technology
Business’s Operating Unit Spanish Latin America described above still remained for the six-month period ended
March 31, 2019 (see Note 1 of the other explanatory notes of the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial
Statements).

For the purposes of this offering memorandum, we refer to the financial year ended September 30, 2017 as the
“2016/2017 Financial Year,” the financial year ended September 30, 2018, as the “2017/2018 Financial Year”
and the financial year ended September 30, 2019, as the “2018/2019 Financial Year.”

After the completion of the Transaction, we expect to report our financial results and condition at the level of
thyssenkrupp Elevator until September 30, 2021, and Vertical Topco III thereafter. The Financial Statements in
this offering memorandum have not been adjusted to reflect the impact of any changes that might occur as a
result of purchase price allocation effects to be applied as a result of the Transactions. However, Vertical
Topco III will account for the Acquisition using the acquisition method in accordance with IFRS 3 “Business
_Combinations” and will apply purchase price allocation effects in connection with the Transactions to their_
financial statements for accounting periods subsequent to the Acquisition Closing Date. The application of
purchase accounting could result in different carrying values for existing assets and assets we may add to our
balance sheet, which may include intangible assets, such as goodwill, leasehold rights and software, and different
amortization and depreciation expenses. Due to these and other potential adjustments, our future financial
statements could be materially different once the adjustments are made and may not be comparable to the
Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

Financial data in this offering memorandum as of and for the 2016/2017, 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 Financial
Years, and for the six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2020, (i) if presented as “audited,” is taken from the
Audited Combined Financial Statements and (ii) if presented as “unaudited,” is taken or derived from the
Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements, thyssenkrupp Elevator’s accounting records or its internal
management reporting systems or derived from the Audited Combined Financial Statements.

In making an investment decision, investors must rely upon their own examination of our business, the terms of
the Offering and the financial information presented in this offering memorandum.

**Basis of Preparation**

The preparation of the Audited Combined Financial Statements in conformity with IFRS, and the preparation of
the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with IAS 34, require the use of certain
critical accounting estimates. These standards also require management to exercise its judgment in the process of
applying accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where
assumptions and estimates are significant, are disclosed in the financial statements. IFRS differs in various
respects from generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). The Group has not
prepared a reconciliation of its financial information to U.S. GAAP or a summary of significant differences in the
accounting and valuation methods of IFRS and U.S. GAAP and does not intend to do so in the future. Potential
investors should therefore consult their own professional advisors for an understanding of the differences
between IFRS and U.S. GAAP.

**_The Audited Combined Financial Statements_**

As IFRS does not provide guidelines for the preparation of combined financial statements, the preparation of the
Audited Combined Financial Statements was subject to IAS 8 “Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting
_Estimates and Errors,” particularly IAS 8.12, which required management of thyssenkrupp Elevator AG to_
consider recent pronouncements of other standard-setting bodies, other financial reporting requirements and

xviii


-----

recognized industry practices in connection with the preparation of the Audited Combined Financial Statements.
Accordingly, in preparing the Audited Combined Financial Statements, thyssenkrupp Elevator applied the
predecessor accounting approach in accordance with recognized industry practices and rules on business
combinations under common control. In general, thyssenkrupp Elevator used the same accounting policies and
measurement principles in preparing the Audited Combined Financial Statements as were used in preparing the
IFRS consolidated financial statements of thyssenkrupp AG (the “extraction method”). This approach has been
adjusted with respect to transactions with thyssenkrupp Group companies and to ensure compliance with IFRS.
Transactions between the Elevator Technology Business and the remaining thyssenkrupp Group were recognized
in accordance with IFRS and classified as related party transactions as defined in IAS 24 “Related Party
_Disclosures.”_

New IFRS accounting standards were applied in the Audited Combined Financial Statements of the Elevator
Technology Business in fiscal years from October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2019, as follows:

- IFRS 9 (Financial instruments) was adopted in the 2018/2019 Financial Year by opting to apply the
standard prospectively (i.e., from the beginning of the 2018/2019 Financial Year) and accordingly, no
adjusted comparative information was disclosed.

- IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) was adopted in 2018/2019 Financial Year by applying
the full retrospective approach to initial application. Due to the financial statements of that fiscal year for
thyssenkrupp AG only presenting one comparative period, the cumulative transition effects were included
directly in retained earnings at the start of the comparative period on October 1, 2017. In contrast, for the
Audited Combined Financial Statements of the Elevator Technology Business, due to the additional
comparative period from October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017 presented, according to the full
retrospective approach, IFRS 15 has been applied from the beginning of the 2016/2017 Financial Year for
the Audited Combined Financial Statements of the Elevator Technology Business (i.e. the cumulative
transition effects were included directly in invested equity attributable to the thyssenkrupp AG at the start of
the comparative period on October 1, 2016).

- IFRS 16 (Leases) was adopted in the 2019/2020 Financial Year by thyssenkrupp AG by opting to apply the
simplified approach of using the modified retrospective method (i.e., the cumulative transition effects are
included directly in equity on October 1, 2019 and the standard is applied from the beginning of the
2019/2020 Financial Year) and no adjusted comparative information was accordingly disclosed.

Additional information on the scope and basis of preparation of the Audited Combined Financial Statements and
the application of significant accounting policies is presented in Note 1 “Basis of preparation” and Note 2
“Summary of significant accounting policies” to the Audited Combined Financial Statements.

As a result, the Audited Combined Financial Statements included in this offering memorandum may not reflect
what the results of operations, financial position and cash flows would have been had the Group operated as a
separate, stand-alone business without the shared resources of thyssenkrupp AG for the periods presented, and
may not be indicative of our future results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The fact that the
companies and operating activities comprising the Elevator Technology Business did not historically exist as a
separate group limits the validity of the combined financial information.

**_The Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements_**

The Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the six months ended March 31, 2020,
were prepared in accordance with IAS 34 and the requirements for first-time consolidated financial statements in
accordance with IFRS 1 (First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards). In preparing the
Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements, thyssenkrupp Elevator applied the predecessor accounting
approach in accordance with recognized industry practices and rules on business combinations under common
control in line with IDW RS HFA 50 Module IFRS 3 M2 published by the Institute of Public Auditors in
Germany (Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer in Deutschland e.V., IDW). In general, thyssenkrupp Elevator applied
the same accounting policies and measurement principles in preparing the Unaudited Interim Consolidated
Financial Statements as were used in preparing the IFRS consolidated financial statements of thyssenkrupp AG
(i.e., the “extraction method”). This approach has been adjusted with respect to transactions with thyssenkrupp
Group companies and to ensure compliance with IFRS. Transactions between thyssenkrupp Elevator and the
thyssenkrupp Group were recognized in accordance with IFRS and classified as related party transactions as
defined in IAS 24 “Related Party Disclosures.”

**IFRS 16 (Leases)**

The Financial Statements are prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS. On January 13, 2016, the IASB
published IFRS 16 (Leases), and the European Union adopted IFRS 16 on November 9, 2017. IFRS 16 replaced
IAS 17 and the related IFRIC and SIC interpretations, and resulted in almost all leases being recognized on the
balance sheet, as the distinction between operating and finance leases was eliminated. Under the new standard,
the lessee recognizes an asset (the right-to-use the leased asset) and a financial liability to pay lease payments.
The only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases should a company elect to apply an available practical
expedient in order to reduce the transition effort. IFRS 16 became effective for fiscal years commencing on or
after January 1, 2019.

The Group adopted IFRS 16 (Leases) on October 1, 2019, by opting to apply the simplified approach of using the
modified retrospective method, which means that the cumulative transition effects are included directly in equity
on October 1, 2019, and the standard is applied from the beginning of the 2019/2020 Financial Year.
Accordingly, no adjusted comparative information was disclosed.

Unless otherwise indicated, operating and financial information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020,
represents the mathematical calculation of adding the financial information for the six months ended March 31,
2020 (as derived from the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements) to the difference between the
financial information for the year ended September 30, 2019 (as derived from the Audited Combined Financial
Statements), and the six months ended March 31, 2019 (as derived from the Unaudited Interim Consolidated
Financial Statements), without accounting for differences in the application of accounting measures. The
financial information of the Group as of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020 includes the six month
period ended March 31, 2020, in which IFRS 16 was adopted for the first-time and also includes the calculated
six month period from April 1, 2019 to September 30, 2019, for which leases were accounted for in accordance
with IAS 17 and the related IFRIC and SIC interpretations, as described above. The first-time adoption of
IFRS 16 had significant impact on certain balance sheet and income statement items, as described above and also
in Note 1 in the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. For that reason, the financial information
as of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020, is limited in its meaningfulness.

The transition to IFRS 16 on October 1, 2019, gave rise to changes to our assets and liabilities. As a result,
figures as of and for the six months ended March 31, 2020, may not be comparable to the results presented for
prior periods. As of March 31, 2020, our right-of-use assets amounted to €397 million and lease liabilities
amounted to €330 million. The depreciation of right-of-use assets for the six months ended March 31, 2020,
amounted to €49 million and the interest expense from lease liabilities amounted to €8 million.

For an analysis of the impact of the first-time application of IFRS 16 (Leases) from October 1, 2019, see
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting
_Comparability of Our Financial Statements—Changes to Accounting Standards—IFRS 16” and the Notes to the_
Audited Combined Financial Statements.

**Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information**

This offering memorandum also includes certain unaudited pro forma financial information of the SUN Issuer
and the EUR SSN Issuer as of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020, including pro forma net senior
secured indebtedness, pro forma net indebtedness and pro forma interest expense, which has been prepared to
illustrate the effect of the Transactions as if the Transactions had occurred (i) on March 31, 2020, for the
purposes of calculating pro forma net senior secured indebtedness and pro forma net indebtedness and (ii) on
April 1, 2019, for the purposes of calculating pro forma interest expense. The pro forma financial information as
of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020, has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and does
not represent what our indebtedness or interest expense would have been had the Transactions occurred on
March 31, 2020, or April 1, 2019, respectively; nor does it purport to project our financial results, indebtedness
or interest expense at any future date.

The pro forma financial information as of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020, has not been
prepared in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting standards or in accordance with the
requirements of Regulation S-X of the Securities Act, the Prospectus Regulation, or any other regulations of the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or any other regulator. Neither the assumptions underlying the pro
forma adjustments nor the resulting pro forma financial information as of and for the twelve months ended
March 31, 2020, have been audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted auditing standards.

The unaudited pro forma adjustments and the unaudited pro forma financial data set forth in this offering
memorandum are based on available information and certain assumptions and estimates that we believe are

reasonable and may differ materially from the actual adjusted amounts. These pro forma measures are not
financial measures defined in accordance with IFRS and, as such, may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures used by other companies.

**Financial Information for the Twelve Months Ended March 31, 2020**

The financial information of the Group for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020, is unaudited and has been
calculated by taking the financial information for the six months ended March 31, 2020 (as derived from the
Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements) and adding it to the difference between the results of
operations for the year ended September 30, 2019 (as derived from the Audited Combined Financial Statements)
and the interim financial information for the six months ended March 31, 2019 (as derived from the Unaudited
Interim Consolidated Financial Statements). The financial information for the twelve months ended March 31,
2020 constitutes a Non-GAAP Measure (as defined below), has not been audited or reviewed by our auditors, is
not required by or presented in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles and
has been prepared for illustrative purpose only. This information is not necessarily representative of our results of
operations for such period or any future period or any financial position at any past or future date.

There are certain key differences between the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and the
Audited Combined Financial Statements, which limit the comparability and meaningfulness of the financial
information of the Group for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020. These include the following:

- The six month period ended March 31, 2020, accounts for leases under IFRS 16, which was adopted for the
first beginning on October 1, 2019. The calculated six month period from April 1, 2019 to September 30,
2019, on the other hand, accounts for leases in accordance with IAS 17 and the related IFRIC and SIC
interpretations, as described under “—IFRS 16 (Leases)”. The first-time adoption of IFRS 16 had significant
impact on certain balance sheet and income statement items, as described under “—IFRS 16 (Leases)” and
also in Note 1 in the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements;

- The six month period ended March 31, 2020 includes (i) costs for corporate services provided to the Target
by thyssenkrupp AG through a combination of direct service agreements and transitional service agreements
from the period from January 1, 2020 to March 31, 2020, which were entered into with effect from
January 1, 2020 as part of the carve-out of the Elevator Technology Business from the thyssenkrupp Group
and (ii) central cost allocations from thyssenkrupp AG from the period from October 1, 2019 to
December 31, 2019, which were allocated in accordance with carve-out accounting principles and represent
a proportionate amount of corporate costs and non-operational effects that were historically recorded at the
parent company level without being recharged to the Elevator Technology Business. The calculated six
month period from April 1, 2019 to September 30, 2019 also includes central cost allocations from
thyssenkrupp AG, which were allocated in accordance with carve-out accounting principles and represent a
proportionate amount of corporate costs and non-operational effects that were historically recorded at the
parent company level without being recharged to the Elevator Technology Business. For more information,
see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key
_Factors Affecting our Results of Operations—Corporate Cost Allocations”;_

- The six month period ended March 31, 2020 accounts for the use of the “thyssenkrupp” brand as an
intangible asset with indefinite useful life in accordance with IAS 38 (Intangible Assets), on the payment of
a one-time fee under a license agreement dated September 25, 2019 entered into between thyssenkrupp
Elevator Innovation and thyssenkrupp AG. In connection with the Acquisition, the License Agreement was
amended in March 2020, resulting in the intangible asset for the right of use of the “thyssenkrupp” brand to
be classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 in the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial
Statements. See “Certain _Relationships_ _and_ _Related_ _Party_ _Transactions—Relationships_ _with_ _the_
_thyssenkrupp Group in the Past—License Agreement”. The calculated six month period from April 1, 2019_
to September 30, 2019, on the other hand, accounted for the use of the “thyssenkrupp” brand under an
operating licensing model, as an expense recognized under “other expenses” in its profit or loss statement.

**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**

**_General_**

In this offering memorandum, we present certain financial measures that are not recognized by IFRS or any other
generally accepted accounting principles and that may not be permitted to appear on the face of the Financial
Statements or footnotes thereto. The primary non-GAAP financial measures used in this offering memorandum
include Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBIT margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, business cash

xxi

flow (post-restructuring), business cash flow (pre-restructuring), capital expenditures, cash conversion, EBIT,
EBIT margin, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, free cash flow, Lease Adjusted EBITDA, operating net working
capital, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and other figures for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020 (our
“Non-GAAP Measures”). Each of the EBITDA-based and net income-based measures presented in this offering
memorandum is defined and calculated differently from the definition of “Consolidated Net Income” and
“Consolidated EBITDA” presented in the Indentures.

Our primary Non-GAAP Measures are defined as follows:

- “Adjusted EBIT” is defined as EBIT as adjusted for certain special items, including restructuring expenses,
impairment charges/reversals and other non-operating expenses and income;

- “Adjusted EBIT margin” is defined as Adjusted EBIT divided by sales;

- “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as Adjusted EBIT as adjusted further by adding back depreciation and
amortization expense;

- “Adjusted EBITDA margin” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by sales;

- “business cash flow (post-restructuring)” is defined as business cash flow (pre-restructuring) after
restructuring payments;

- “business cash flow (pre-restructuring)” is defined as free cash flow before restructuring payments, major
M&A transaction payments, payments for the “thyssenkrupp” brand, income taxes paid, payments made to
the remaining thyssenkrupp Group under tax group arrangements and net of interest received/paid;

- “capital expenditures” is defined as the sum of purchase of investments accounted for using the equity
method and non-current financial assets, expenditures for acquisitions of consolidated companies net of cash
acquired, capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment (inclusive of advance payments),
expenditures for acquisitions of shares in the Group from thyssenkrupp Group, cash advances and loans
classified as investing activities and capital expenditures for intangible assets (inclusive of advance
payments);

- “cash conversion” is defined as business cash flow (pre-restructuring) divided by Adjusted EBIT;

- “EBIT” is defined as income/(loss) before tax, finance income, finance expense and “thyssenkrupp” brand
charges but including certain finance expenses and finance income assigned to EBIT based on the economic
classification;

- “EBIT margin” is defined as EBIT divided by sales;

- “EBITDA” is defined as EBIT before depreciation and amortization expense;

- “EBITDA margin” is defined as EBITDA divided by sales;

- “free cash flow” is defined as operating cash flows less cash flows from investing activities;

- “Lease Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as adjusted further for the estimated effect of
our adoption of IFRS 16 as if it had been adopted at the beginning of each period presented. While
calculating the Lease Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020, in a first step we
excluded the rental expenses resulting from operating leases in accordance with IAS17 for the six month
period between April 1, 2019 to September 30, 2019. In a second step we doubled the values for lease
expense that were recorded in connection with short-term leases, leases for low value assets and expenses
for variable payments for the six month period from October 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020, which were
recognized in accordance with IFRS16;

- “operating net working capital” is defined as total assets less total non-current assets less current financial
and non-financial assets less current income taxes less cash and cash equivalents plus advance payments to
suppliers of inventories and to other current non-financial assets less trade accounts payable and contract
liabilities; and

- “Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as Lease Adjusted EBITDA adjusted further for certain cost
savings adjustments.

These measures are presented in this offering memorandum because they are measures our management used to
assess operating performance, and we believe that they and similar measures are widely used in our industry as a
means of evaluating a company’s operating performance and financing structure, and because we believe they
present helpful comparisons of financial performance between periods by excluding the distorting effect of
certain non-recurring items.

Our Non-GAAP Measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS, U.S.
GAAP, German GAAP or any other generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as
alternatives to performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS, U.S. GAAP, German GAAP or any other
generally accepted accounting principles. Our Non-GAAP Measures may not be comparable to other similarly
titled measures of other companies and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in
isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. Some of the limitations of
Non-GAAP Measures are that:

- they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital investments or contractual
commitments;

- they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

- they do not reflect the significant interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or
principal payments on our debt;

- they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay;

- they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our consolidated income
statement;

- they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not to be
indicative of our ongoing operations;

- assets are depreciated or amortized over differing estimated useful lives and often have to be replaced in the
future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and

- other companies in our industry and analysts may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting
their usefulness as comparative measures.

Because of these limitations, our Non-GAAP Measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary
cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to
meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on the Financial
Statements and using these Non-GAAP Measures only to supplement evaluation of our performance.

**Rounding**

Certain numerical figures set out in this offering memorandum, including financial data presented in million or
thousand and percentage terms, have been subject to rounding adjustments and, as a result, the totals of the data
in this offering memorandum may vary slightly from the actual arithmetic totals of such information. In addition,
as a result of such rounding, the totals of certain financial information presented in tabular form may differ from
the information that would have appeared in such totals using the unrounded financial information. Percentages
and amounts reflecting changes over time periods relating to financial and other data set forth in “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” are calculated using the numerical_
data in the Audited Combined Financial Statements contained in this offering memorandum, as applicable, and
not using the numerical data in the narrative description thereof.

In respect of financial data set forth in the main body of this offering memorandum, a dash (“—”) signifies that
the relevant figure is not available, while a zero (“0”) signifies that the relevant figure is available but has been
rounded to zero. By contrast, no such differentiation has been made in respect of the financial data set forth in the
financial information section of this offering memorandum beginning on page F-1. In the financial information
section, zero (“0”) is used to signify both unavailable figures and figures which are either exactly zero or have
been rounded to zero.

**EXCHANGE RATE INFORMATION**

We publish our Financial Statements in euro. The following table sets forth, for the periods set forth below, the
high, low, average and period end Bloomberg Composite Rate (London) expressed as U.S. dollars per €1.00. The
Bloomberg Composite Rate is a “best market” calculation, in which, at any point in time, the bid rate is equal to
the highest bid rate of all contributing bank indications and the ask rate is set to the lowest ask rate offered by
these banks. The Bloomberg Composite Rate is a mid-value rate between the applied highest bid rate and the
lowest ask rate. The below rates may differ from the actual rates used in the preparation of the Financial
Statements (see, for instance, Note 2 of the Audited Combined Financial Statements) and other financial
information appearing in this offering memorandum. We make no representation that the euro or U.S. dollar
amounts referred to in this offering memorandum have been, could have been or could, in the future, be
converted into U.S. dollars or euro, as the case may be, at any particular rate, if at all.

The average rate for a year means the average of the Bloomberg Composite Rates on the last business day of
each month during a year. The average rate for a month, or for any shorter period, means the average of the daily
Bloomberg Composite Rates during that month, or shorter period, as the case may be.

The Bloomberg Composite Rate of the euro on June 19, 2020 was $1.1193 per €1.00.

**SUMMARY**

_The following summary contains basic information about us and this Offering and is qualified by, and should be_
_read in conjunction with, the more detailed information appearing elsewhere in this offering memorandum. This_
_summary is not complete and does not contain all the information that you should consider before investing in_
_the Notes. For a more complete understanding of this Offering, we encourage you to read this entire offering_
_memorandum carefully, including “Risk Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial_
_Condition and Results of Operations,” “Business,” “Regulation” and the Financial Statements and the notes_
_thereto contained elsewhere in this offering memorandum._

**Overview**

We are one of the world’s leading providers of elevator and escalator technology, with top market positions in
the Americas, Europe and Africa and a strong platform to capture growth opportunities in the Asia Pacific region.
We design, manufacture, install, service and modernize state-of-the-art passenger and freight elevators,
escalators, moving walkways, passenger boarding bridges and chair and platform lifts, covering the entire
product life cycle from new installation to service and modernization. Building on our German engineering
heritage, we are an innovation leader in the digital age, leveraging Internet of Things technologies to collect data
and make recommendations for repairs in real time to better serve rapidly urbanizing societies with a focus on
product safety and efficiency. Operating from approximately 1,000 locations worldwide and serving customers in
more than 100 countries, our business is characterized by a global sales and service network to ensure optimum
proximity to clients. High-profile infrastructure projects such as One World Trade Center in New York, the
tallest building in the Americas, the Beijing International Airport T3 Terminal and the Federation Tower in
Russia have all featured our elevator and escalator products, illustrating our strengths and global reach. For the
twelve months ended March 31, 2020, our sales and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA were €8,048 million and
€1,323 million, respectively.

Our operations comprise three business lines:

- _New Installation:_ Our New Installation business covers the design, manufacture and installation of
elevators, escalators and moving walks for all major markets and industries, including for both commercial
and residential projects, and includes low-rise, mid-rise and high-rise solutions offered at different
customization levels. Our New Installation business contributed 45% of sales in the twelve months ended
March 31, 2020.

- _Service:_ Our Service business offers a broad range of maintenance services both for our own and thirdparty equipment, with a view to ensuring the continued safety, performance and efficiency of elevators,
escalators and moving walkways throughout their usable lives. Depending on the scope agreed in our
service contracts, our services range from basic oil and grease maintenance to bespoke full-service packages
that include the sale and installation of replacement parts. As of March 31, 2020, we had approximately
1.4 million units under maintenance. Our Service business contributed 43% of sales in the twelve months
ended March 31, 2020.

- _Modernization:_ Our Modernization business offers comprehensive solutions ranging from partial
modernization to complete replacement of existing elevator and escalator systems and other solutions, both
for our own and for third-party systems. Our Modernization business contributed 12% of sales in the twelve
months ended March 31, 2020.

Our life-cycle business model is built on our New Installation business, which serves as the entry to our Service
business. On average, we convert 70% to 80% of new elevator and escalator installations into ongoing Service
contracts. This provides a source of stable and recurring sales as we also succeeded in retaining more than 90%
of our Service customers in each of our last three financial years. In addition, we win Service and Modernization
contracts from third parties where another manufacturer undertook the New Installation. The Service and
Modernization businesses, which together accounted for 54% of sales and around 70% of gross profit in the
2018/2019 Financial Year, are a source of stable, recurring sales and high profit margins for the Group, which
provides visibility on future earnings. Driven by our high conversion rate and high retention rates, we have been
able to maintain longstanding customer relationships. Given our global reach and high level of diversification,
our top ten customers in aggregate typically account for less than 3% of our annual revenue.

We have two core divisions and four operating segments, which are part of our reporting segments in accordance
with IFRS 8: Americas, Europe/Africa, Asia/Pacific and Access Solutions (together, our “Operating Segments”)
through which we conduct our customer-facing business activities. Our first core division is the new installation,
service and modernization of elevators, escalators and moving walks (the “Elevator and Escalator division”). Our
second core division is the new installation, service and modernization of access solutions for airports and homes
(the “Access Solutions division”).

The Elevator and Escalator division is divided into three Operating Segments based on geography, which enables
each to tailor its products to the specific customer needs and legal and regulatory requirements in its local markets:

- _Americas:_ Our Americas segment covers our Elevator and Escalator division’s activities in the Americas
and is sub-divided into two further regional units, including North America, covering the United States and
Canada, and Latin America, covering Brazil as the main Latin American sales area and Spanish Latin
America. Our Americas segment contributed €3,306 million, or 41%, of the Operating Segments’ total sales
and €489 million, or 51%, of the Operating Segments’ Adjusted EBIT in the 2018/2019 Financial Year.

- _Europe/Africa:_ Our Europe/Africa segment covers our Elevator and Escalator division’s activities in
Europe and Africa and operates within a widely diverse set of geographical areas through five operational
units: “DACH,” comprising Germany, Austria and Switzerland, “RET,” comprising Russia, Eastern Europe
and Turkey, “FRANCE,” comprising France and Monaco, “BBNI,” comprising the Benelux countries,
Britain, the Nordics and Italy and “IBA,” comprising Spain, Portugal, Angola and Morocco and, through
distributors, certain African countries. Our Europe/Africa segment contributed €2,149 million, or 26%, of
the Operating Segments’ total sales and €227 million, or 24%, of the Operating Segments’ Adjusted EBIT
in the 2018/2019 Financial Year.

- _Asia/Pacific:_ Our Asia/Pacific segment covers our Elevator and Escalator division’s activities in the Asia/
Pacific region and is organized in six operational units: China, South Korea, India, Australia/New Zealand,
Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Our Asia/Pacific segment contributed €2,307 million, or 28%, of the
Operating Segments’ total sales and €178 million, or 19%, of the Operating Segments’ Adjusted EBIT in
the 2018/2019 Financial Year.

Our Access Solutions division operates across all geographies and constitutes our fourth Operating Segment. It
employs a number of different sales strategies and distribution channels, catering to both the business-to-business
and business-to-consumer markets. The Access Solutions division accounted for 5% of the Operating Segments’
total sales and 6% of the Operating Segments’ Adjusted EBIT in the 2018/2019 Financial Year.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

**_Well-established player with a leading global position_**

We hold the top four market position in the global elevator and escalator market (excluding Japan) based on
revenues in the 2017/2018 Financial Year. Our Elevator and Escalator division is divided into three geographical
segments, the Americas, Europe/Africa and Asia/Pacific, which comprise the majority of elevator and escalator
markets worldwide. Based on revenue in the 2017/2018 Financial Year, we hold the number two position in the
Americas, our most profitable elevator and escalator region, the number four position in Europe/Africa, which
has the largest service business by value globally, and the number five position in Asia/Pacific, the world’s
largest new installations market. As of March 31, 2020, we had 1.4 million units under maintenance across the
globe.

The following graph shows our market position in the elevator and escalator market (excluding Japan) based on
sales in the 2017/2018 Financial Year:

Otis Schindler Kone thyssenkrupp Elevator Mitsubishi Hitachi Hyundai Fujitec Toshiba

We believe that our status as a global leader in the elevator and escalator industry is attributable to our
particularly strong and far-reaching service network, our track record of high profile infrastructure projects, and
our offering of products and services across the life cycle of elevators and escalators, from new installation to
service to modernization. In addition, we believe that our expertise in the manufacturing and provision of spare
parts, along with our network of specialists and a strong and globally recognized German engineering heritage,
have resulted in a particularly high ranking among our peers with regards to competency of our field force, which
in conjunction with our innovation technology, are what we believe to be the primary purchasing criteria for
customers and puts us in a position of strength relative to our peers. Our strong market position is also driven by
our offering of some of the most innovative and cutting-edge elevator solutions in the world, such as our MAX
technology (“MAX”), our cloud-based maintenance tool, which utilizes Internet of Things (“IoT”) technologies
to collect data on installed units and make recommendations for repairs in real time, making it immensely
valuable to our Service business. In addition, we are in the process of developing the innovative MULTI elevator
system (“MULTI”), a rope-less elevator able to move both vertically and horizontally.

**_Highly resilient business model across cycles through service focused-business and balanced global footprint_**

We have developed a business model that we believe is stable, balanced and resilient through economic cycles,
and therefore, well-positioned for sustainable, long-term value generation, as demonstrated by our strong longterm historical growth. We have delivered resilient sales and Adjusted EBIT margins since the 2007/2008
Financial Year. Despite negative currency effects in recent financial years, our sales have increased from
€7,674 million in the 2016/2017 Financial Year to €8,048 million in the twelve months ended March 31, 2020,
highlighting the stability of our business and our ability to maintain our sales and profitability over the economic
cycle despite external pressures.

The main driver of the resilience and stability of our overall business is the life cycle of our business model. Our
New Installation business is a key driver of our growing installed base and units under maintenance and therefore


3


-----

is the entry gate to our Service and Modernization business. The Service business generates revenue streams that
include fees for regular maintenance and income from repairs and spare parts. The strong profitability and the
asset-light character of our Service business contribute to our high cash generation. For the 2016/2017,
2017/2018 and 2018/2019 Financial Years, 70% to 80% of our New Installation units converted into Service
units. In each of the 2016/2017, 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 Financial Years, the Service business maintained a
global retention rate of over 90%. Many of our Service business customers eventually become customers of our
Modernization business, which offers us the opportunity to generate revenue from retrofitting or replacing entire
systems of elevators and escalators while continuing the customer relationship. In addition, we attract many
Service customers whose elevator and escalator systems were manufactured and installed by third parties, adding
to our steady Service and Modernization revenue streams.

The high resilience of our business is also driven by a diversified customer base with long-term contracts and
high customer retention rates and a balanced global footprint, minimizing both customer and geographic
concentration risks. Our top ten customers accounted for less than 3% of sales in each of the 2016/2017,
2017/2018 and 2018/2019 Financial Years. Geographically, our elevator and escalator operations (including
manufacturing facilities, service centers and employees) are divided across three Operating Segments: the
Americas, Europe/Africa and Asia/Pacific, which accounted for 41%, 26% and 28% of our Operating Segment’s
total sales, respectively, in the twelve months ended March 31, 2020. Our fourth Operating Segment, the Access
Solutions division, operates globally and generated 5% of our Operating Segments’ total sales for the same
period.

The resilience of our business model is demonstrated by our financial performance during periods of worldwide
economic distress. For example, during the global financial crisis, our total Adjusted EBIT margin and sales
remained stable between the 2008/2009 Financial Year and the 2009/2010 Financial Year. Most recently, we
have been able to successfully manage and limit the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business by
having immediately implemented contingency measures, which we believe further proves the resilience of our
business model through the economic cycles. See “Recent Developments—Coronavirus (COVID-19).”

**_Highly attractive industry with structural growth drivers_**

We operate in the global elevator and escalator market, which generated sales of €55.8 billion in 2019 worldwide
(excluding Japan). The global elevator and escalator market grew at a CAGR of 1.7% between 2014 and 2019,
and prior to taking into account the impact of COVID-19, was expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.3% between
2019 and 2024, above expected real GDP growth. Specifically, between 2019 and 2024, the new installation,
service and modernization businesses were expected to grow at a CAGR of 1.7%, 3.9% and 6.9%, respectively.
This growth is underpinned by structural factors and megatrends, including increasing urbanization, an aging
population, a supportive regulatory environment and sustainability and digitalization trends.

Increasing urbanization is one of the primary drivers for the need for more urban spaces worldwide, which
increases demand for elevators and escalators, as they are an inherent component of the residential and
commercial multi-story buildings that characterize urban environments. By 2050, the number of urban
inhabitants is expected to increase by 55%, from approximately four billion today to nearly seven billion. In
particular, the urban population is expected to increase in emerging markets, including from approximately 60%
in 2018 to 80% in 2050 in China. This trend positively affects the growth of the elevator and escalator market, as
urban residents increasingly demand the access and convenience provided by elevators and escalators,
particularly in cities in the developed world where large-scale urban living and infrastructure projects (such as
hospitals, shopping malls and train stations) are increasingly required to offer fast and efficient urban mobility
solutions.

Growth in the elevator and escalator market is also driven by an increasingly aging population. The ratio of
people over the age of 65 years to those under the age of five years is expected to rise from approximately 1:1 in
2019 to 2:1 in 2050. This trend is likely to support demand for elevator and escalator solutions as well as home
access solutions for stairs, as the growing aging population will need or prefer the mobility afforded by elevators,
escalators and home access solutions.

In addition, growth in the elevator and escalator market is driven by a supportive regulatory environment, which
requires the owners of elevator and escalator systems to invest in basic maintenance services to ensure their
systems are consistently operating safely. Currently, over 50% of elevators in North America and Europe are
over 20 years old. As the installed base of elevators and escalators grows and ages, property owners are
increasingly in need of modernizing their elevators and escalators to ensure they comply with applicable


4


-----

regulatory requirements and continue to operate safely. In Asia/Pacific, including China and South Korea, we
believe that there is a particularly strong opportunity to grow our Service and Modernization businesses driven
by the aging of the installed base in those markets and stricter safety regulations requiring regular maintenance
and upgrades.

We believe that long-term growth in the elevator and escalator market will also be positively impacted by a
continued focus on digitalization, connectivity and sustainability, as customers increasingly value features such
as improved energy efficiency and enhanced safety and maintenance monitoring. According to the Market Size/
_Growth Analysis, the market for buildings with digitally automated operations or “smart buildings” is expected to_
grow at 5% per annum through 2024. We believe that our current innovative smart mobility solutions and our
strong research and development capabilities position us to benefit from this demand. For example, our TWIN
elevator system (“TWIN”), which combines two independent cars in one shaft, can already reduce energy costs
by up to 25% and increase usable floor space by up to 25%. In addition we estimate that our MULTI system,
which we are in the process of developing and will be the world’s first rope-free elevator, will allow for space
reductions of up to a further 30% to 50% compared to our TWIN system. We aim to consistently increase
product efficiency and provide additional value-add to our customers across our portfolio of new and existing
products and services.

**_A leader in technology and innovation in the elevator and escalator market_**

We believe that we are a leading innovator in the elevator and escalator market, offering disruptive innovation
and transformative digital solutions. We have been able to successfully monetize IoT and digital opportunities, as
demonstrated by our recently developed MAX technology and our proprietary IT system, VIEW. MAX is a
cloud-based maintenance tool which utilizes IoT technologies to collect data relating to customer elevator units
and make diagnostic recommendations, such as when repairs need to be undertaken or which critical parts need
to be replaced. VIEW is an operational business steering tool, which, among other things, automatically
dispatches qualified technicians to resolve the problems identified by MAX, often even before any visible
operational issues occur. Leveraging our expertise in IoT and other digital tools enables us to improve customer
satisfaction by increasing service quality and efficiency, thereby increasing our customer retention rates and
decreasing cancellation rates.

In addition, we believe that we have created some of the most innovative elevator concepts currently in operation
in the market. We are the only supplier in the industry to have an offering similar to our TWIN elevator system,
which combines two independent cars in one shaft. We are also currently in the process of developing the
MULTI system, which would be the world’s first rope-free elevator, allowing for space reductions of up to a
further 30% to 50% compared to our TWIN system. These systems offer customers greater space efficiency and
architectural flexibility than conventional designs, making us an attractive choice for a customer base that is
increasingly demanding more innovative elevator and escalator products.

**_Strong financial profile with significant operational improvement opportunity._**

We have a track record of long-term stable sales growth, high cash flow generation and high earnings visibility
on recurring future earnings driven by a ten- to 20-year elevator life cycle with a retention rate of over 90%. Our
Elevator and Escalator division has grown consistently over the years, with our Adjusted EBIT margin generally
increasing since the 2011/2012 Financial Year until the 2016/2017 Financial Year. While facing some
headwinds, especially from material price developments and trade tariffs implemented in recent years, we believe
that, following the Transactions, there will be greater opportunity to increase our Adjusted EBIT margin.

Our business benefits from high revenue visibility given the recurring and stable nature of our Service and
Modernization business model. Our New Installation business represents the key enabler for growth of Service
and Modernization by growing our units under maintenance and offering high visibility of future business
performance due to long order-to-fulfilment times. Most of our New Installation units are converted into
maintenance units, which propels our Service business. Our Service contracts on average have a gross profit
margin of approximately 40%, which progressively increases over the elevator’s lifetime due to increased spare
parts sales. Many of our Service business customers eventually become customers of our Modernization
business, driven by an aging installed base with the need to upgrade and extend the life cycle of the elevators and
escalators. The Service and Modernization businesses, which together accounted for 54% of sales and around
70% of gross profit for the 2018/2019 Financial Year, are a source of stable, recurring sales and high profit
margins for the Group. Our Service contracts have an average length between one to five years. Our full life

cycle business model, with our high conversion and retention rates across businesses and long-term customer
relationships, enables high visibility on recurring future earnings.

The following graph illustrates how the elevator life-cycles allow high visibility on future recurring earnings:

The profitability of our business is also driven by our fully invested global foothold, which requires limited
capital expenditure and working capital given our asset-light business model, resulting in a strong cash flow
profile. Our elevator technology business has significantly increased cash generation since 2011/2012, roughly
doubling its business cash flow through generating higher profits and reducing operating net working capital by
approximately 80%. Our cash conversion rate was approximately 90% in the 2018/2019 Financial Year.
Excluding certain one-off expenditures incurred from time to time (such as €3 million, €6 million and
€106 million for major mergers and acquisition projects in the 2016/2017, 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 Financial
Years (including the acquisitions of Nashville Machine’s elevator division and O’Keefe Elevator Company, Inc.)
as well as carve-out related one-time expenditures of €1,080 million paid in connection with the Licensing
Agreement fee for use of the “thyssenkrupp” brand and of €74 million for carve-out related real estate transfers,
in both cases, in the 2018/2019 Financial Year), our capital expenditures were €145 million, €115 million, and
€129 million for the 2016/2017 Financial Year, the 2017/2018 Financial Year and the 2018/2019 Financial Year,
respectively, highlighting our generally stable and relatively limited capital investment requirements. See
“Summary Financial and Other Data—Other Financial, Operating and Pro Forma Information—Other
_Financial and Operating Information.” We believe that the development of business cash flow and cash_
conversion over the last three financial years demonstrates that we operate an asset-light business with relatively
low capital requirements and high cash returns.

In addition, we believe our business offers significant operational improvement potential and profitability upside.
We have recently implemented several cost optimization initiatives that we believe will generate greater margins.
For example, we have restructured our manufacturing operations by optimizing our footprint and leveraging
shared services and best practices, as well as streamlining our product offerings. These initiatives have led to
stable development in cost of goods sold by partially offsetting personnel cost inflation through efficiency
measures and headcount management, and compensating for material cost increases through purchasing
measures and the improved management of procurement volume. These efficiency measures have also reduced
SG&A costs as a percentage of sales from 18.5% in the 2016/2017 Financial Year to 16.4% in the twelve months
ended March 31, 2020. In addition, following the Acquisition, we expect to realize an additional estimated
€240 million in potential cost savings within 15 to 18 months after July 1, 2020, as part of the Sponsors’
transformation program (the “Transformation Program”). See “—Our Strategies—Core Strategy: Realize
_structural profitability upside” and “Summary Financial and Other Data—Other Financial, Operating and Pro-_
_Forma Information—Other Pro Forma Information.”_


**_Highly experienced and execution focused management team_**

We are led by an experienced, entrepreneurial management team that is committed to continuing our strong track
record of growth, with a focus on product quality, customer service and delayering. Peter Walker, the Group’s
chief executive officer, began his career as an entrepreneur and has more than 25 years’ experience in the
elevator industry. Among other achievements, he was instrumental, as chief executive officer of Asia/Pacific, to
the successful establishment of the Group’s footprint in Asia/Pacific, where he helped drive increases in revenue
and profitability and is credited with turning around the then loss-making South Korea business. Mr. Walker
served as the Group’s chief operating officer before being appointed chief executive officer in 2019. Ercan Keles

has served as the Group’s chief financial officer for eight years and has previously served in various positions for
entities in the thyssenkrupp Group and externally for more than 13 years. Mr. Keles has been key to driving the
Group’s profitability and cost efficiency measures in recent years. Dr. Detlef Hunsdiek, the Company’s chief
human resources officer, has deep restructuring experience and is responsible for rolling out the Group’s
efficiency programs across its global network. In addition to our senior executive team, our business benefits
from our experienced and dedicated local management teams, including the chief executive officers of our
business units, who each have a deep understanding of the elevator and escalator market and geographic
expertise. Together, our management team has successfully grown our business to become the fourth-largest
elevator and escalator company globally (excluding Japan) and increased our sales from €7,674 million in the
2016/2017 Financial Year to €8,048 million in the twelve months ended March 31, 2020.

We have operated largely as an independent company while under thyssenkrupp AG’s ownership. Our
management team, which is strategically positioned around the globe, has maintained responsibility for the
continued operational excellence of our company while under thyssenkrupp AG and has succeeded in improving
performance during that time. Following the completion of the Acquisition, we also expect our business to
benefit from the market expertise, business relationships, knowledge and experience of the Sponsors. Advent and
Cinven have strong expertise and an extensive and successful track record of investing in the industrials and
business services sectors and in carve-out transactions, particularly in Germany, where each of them have had a
presence for more than 20 years and successfully invested individually in more than 39 companies. Worldwide,
Advent and Cinven have invested in 130 companies in the industrials and business services sectors, further
demonstrating considerable experience in the relevant markets. For example, Advent has successfully invested in
Laird, Innio, Allnex, Cobham and Rubix in the industrials sector, Nets and Hune in the business services sector
and Walmart Brasil and Innio in carve-out transactions, while the Cinven Funds have successfully invested in
CeramTec, SLV, and Tractel in the industrials sector, Envirotainer, JLA and Barentz in the business services
sector and CeramTec, Ufinet and Viridium in carve-out transactions. Advent and Cinven also have a strong track
record in successfully executing value creation plans.

In addition, it is expected that thyssenkrupp AG or one or more of its affiliates will invest in an indirect parent
company of Bidco, retaining a minority interest of approximately 19% in the Group. Such shareholding
percentage is indicative and may be subject to variation.

**Our Strategies**

We aim to deliver strong growth in our business, including significant margin expansion, through our three key
strategies, Base, Core, and Core+, as further discussed below.

**_Base Strategy: Continue to capitalize on our market position and structural growth_**

Our Base strategy consists of leveraging the structural factors that drive growth in the market in which we
operate, together with our leading position in those markets, to grow our business and increase our profitability.

As one of the world’s leading elevator and escalator companies, we aim to manufacture and install a substantial
portion of the new elevators and escalators expected to be installed worldwide in the coming years. As a result of
our global scale and strong brand recognition in the market, we believe there is significant sales potential for our
New Installation business and continued growth opportunities for increasing our units under maintenance,
resulting in further revenue and profit generation in our key markets.

In addition, we target continued growth in all our business segments by leveraging structural factors such as an
aging population, global urbanization and stricter safety requirements driving demand for maintenance and
modernization services. In particular, we believe that our Service and Modernization businesses are positioned
for growth as the installed base of elevators and escalators grows and ages.

In the Americas, we target growth in our New Installation business, driven by expected growth in the US
construction sector and our strength in meeting customer demands for efficient execution and technical
excellence, such as our expertise in the hydraulic segment. We target growth in our Service business due to
customer demand for high quality services with short lead times, and through reducing cancellation rates and
winning service contracts for third-party installations. We also target growth in both our Service and
Modernization businesses driven by increases in the average age of the installed base of elevators and escalators
in the region and a strict regulatory environment.

In Europe/Africa, we expect that the large, aging installed base of elevators and escalators, supported by a strict
regulatory environment and high customer retention and conversion rates, will generate attractive service and


7


-----

modernization opportunities. We further expect that strong construction output, particularly from the residential
segment and a slight recovery in Southern Europe as well as a more competitive product offering due to our
manufacturing optimization initiatives in Spain and Germany, will drive our New Installation business and,
consequently, growth in our Service and Modernization businesses.

In Asia/Pacific, we aim to benefit from the anticipated growth of the new installations market, targeting robust
expansion of our New Installation business, including in India and other markets. We believe that growing
customer demand for high quality services and an expanding installed base will also contribute to growth in our
Service and Modernization businesses. We expect that an expanding installed base of elevators and escalators
and the growing importance of IoT solutions, particularly in South Korea, will lead to strong growth
opportunities in our Service and Modernization businesses. We expect China, the largest elevator and escalator
market in Asia, will continue to generate our highest New Installation growth globally, and that conversion of
many of these newly installed units to Service contracts will continue to drive growth in the Service business. We
believe that there is a particularly strong opportunity to grow our Service and Modernization businesses in China
and other developing markets, driven by the growth and the aging of the installed base in those markets and
stricter safety regulations requiring regular maintenance and upgrades, which many emerging market countries
are adopting as their regulatory systems mature.

**_Core Strategy: Realize structural profitability upside_**

Our Core strategy consists of realizing structural profitability upside by focusing on (i) standardization within our
New Installation business, (ii) manufacturing optimization, (iii) service and modernization growth and
digitalization, (iv) selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) cost reduction and (v) procurement
optimization. In addition, following the Acquisition, we expect to realize additional cost savings as part of the
Sponsors’ Transformation Program.

_Standardization of Our New Installation Business_

We plan to continue to drive the standardization of our New Installation business by simplifying the amount and
types of products and components we offer our customers.

Historically, in part due to our strategy of growing through acquisitions, we provided customers with a large
share of customized product solutions. This resulted in a highly diverse but overlapping product portfolio and
limited price competitiveness due to the high costs of designing and producing such a wide range of
individualized products. In order to optimize our structure, we are in the process of simplifying our regional
product portfolio and standardizing certain components. For example, the number of product platforms in the
Group has been reduced by more than half in the last decade as part of a process of implementing a simplified
portfolio structure with further improvements planned going forward. In Europe, we have streamlined our major
platforms down to two, which cover 80% of our products. This has resulted in synergies and a strong evolution of
order intake in the first half of 2019/2020 while not impacting customers’ perception of our product offering or
quantity of sales. We believe this will lead us to benefit from economies of scales, focusing our resource
allocation more efficiently and allowing us to provide a more cost-competitive offering without compromising on
customer service.

In addition, we have also standardized and harmonized components across products to allow specific modular
components, such as traction machines, controllers/inverters and doors, to be used across multiple product
platforms, which we expect will result in lower costs due to the use of fewer parts, a leaner set-up, less
complexity, higher agility and easier external sourcing. These initiatives are aimed at focusing our sales teams on
value-based selling by presenting customers with a harmonized product portfolio of key high quality, high
margin products.

We plan to adapt our manufacturing to focus on products that provide our customers with one of three
customization levels for low-rise buildings (less than 45 meters), mid-rise buildings (between 45 and 100 meters)
and high-rise buildings (above 100 meters). These customization levels comprise: (i) Value for Money “100,”
which is our lower priced option with no customization; (ii) Performance “200,” which is our moderately priced
option with medium customization; and (iii) Customization “300,” which is our high priced option with full
customization. This value proposition model offers customers flexible and transparent pricing, which we expect
will make our products especially compelling to customers in high-volume and growth markets, such as large
property developers in Asia/Pacific. Our processes, in turn, will be optimized by focusing on a leaner offering
and steering our salesforces and engineers toward a focus on sales efforts based on product margin potentials and
the conversion of New Installation units into Service contracts and later into Modernization sales.

-----

_Manufacturing Optimization_

We are engaged in an ongoing effort to optimize our manufacturing operations. These measures have included
closing and, where possible, consolidating manufacturing sites, increasing outsourcing of standardized products
and developing factories with improved technology for greater automation. For example, in Asia/Pacific, we
have established leaner manufacturing operations, with a newly established plant in India and advances in
automation at our plants in China and South Korea. In the Americas, we have consolidated all North America
manufacturing at our Middleton facility to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. In Europe/Africa, we have
shifted our factories away from a regional focus (in which a particular factory only serves specific countries) to a
model where all factories can deliver to the entire Europe/Africa region, with each factory having a dedicated
product focus. As part of this shift, we have restructured our Móstoles plant in Spain and we are currently
restructuring our operations in Germany to reduce costs and simplify production.

In the long term, we aim to move away from a classic factory model, where the focus is on major production and shipping
of complete elevator systems and requires high personnel expenses, towards a model where we produce only key, mission
critical components and outsource commoditized parts, resulting in lower fixed costs and higher productivity.

_Service and Modernization Growth and Digitalization_

We aim to deliver service growth through leveraging our attractive business model and IoT innovation
technology.

Our business model contributes to the growth of our Service and Modernization business as, on average, 70% to
80% of New Installation contracts convert into Service contracts, and many of those Service business customers
eventually become customers of the Modernization business. We aim to grow our Service business, which is a
source of stable and recurring sales and high margins, by pursuing multiple initiatives aimed at increasing
revenues per unit while decreasing costs. In particular, we believe that our use of digital and IoT technologies,
including the recently developed MAX and VIEW systems, will enable us to improve customer satisfaction by
increasing service quality and efficiency, and thereby increase customer retention rates and decrease cancellation
rates. Particularly, in North America, our Service business growth is driven by the reduction of cancellation rates.
We have already improved our cancellation rates and we aim to reduce our cancellation rates further through
strict management focus and tools like the MAX and VIEW.

We expect the growth of our Service business will contribute to new Modernization customers as the installed
base grows and ages, generating an additional stream of stable and recurring revenues. We also believe that we
can leverage the scale and efficiency gains achieved by MAX and VIEW to reduce the costs per unit of providing
services, such as technician travel time and spare parts. In addition, we intend to increase our rate of winning
customers away from competitor service providers by enhancing the efficiency of our spare parts organization,
increasing our service training and leveraging the superior quality of our Service business and our capability to
refurbish multi-brand spare parts through our ITS unit.

_SG&A costs optimization_

We aim to reduce SG&A costs by centralizing administrative functions, adopting a range of organizational
efficiency measures and improving our IT systems. Specifically, we are engaged in an ongoing effort to combine
a wide array of administrative processes that historically have been performed locally, such as billing, payroll
and purchasing, into shared service centers. For example, in the United States, we are in the process of
consolidating these functions, previously spread over 18 locations, into one shared service center at the US
headquarters in Atlanta, and we intend to roll out a similar strategy in Europe and Asia. We are also in the
process of harmonizing our IT processes by rolling out VIEW globally, continuing to transition to cloud-based
services, adopting global templates and standards, “delayering,” or flattening, management levels to simplify our
organization and reduce overhead costs and adopting other efficiency enhancements. These measures have
resulted in more than €80 million in total cost savings over the last three financial years.

_Procurement Optimization_

Finally, throughout our Core strategy, we aim to reduce our procurement costs by optimizing our supply chains
through commercial measures, such as, for example, supplier days, clustering managed spend, and engaging in
e-auctions, continuing from measures implemented historically. For example, between the 2011/2012 Financial
Year and the 2018/2019 Financial Year, our purchasing savings increased by 300%, outpacing our procurement
spend which increased by 50%.

_Transformation Program_

Following the Acquisition, we expect to realize €240 million in potential cost savings within 15 to 18 months after
July 1, 2020 through the Sponsors’ Transformation Program, assuming various things, including that the program
will be implemented beginning on July 1, 2020 and driven by key management, including the Chief Executive
Officer of the Group. The Transformation Program focuses on cost savings opportunities related to (i) commercial
operations, (ii) service operations, (iii) procurement costs, (iv) G&A costs and (v) other operational costs. Some of
these initiatives will be continued through the efficiency measures, which we are already in the process of
implementing, as described above.

As part of our commercial operations initiatives under the Transformation Program, we aim to improve our
organizational efficiency by restructuring and centralizing our sales supports team, including by shifting
employees to low cost countries. In addition, we seek to increase our sales force productivity through various
measures, including improving our administrative processes and completing faster technical sales. This is
facilitated by our offering of fewer customization options resulting from the optimization of our product and
service portfolios. We also intend to increase our focus on sales efforts based on product margin potentials and
the conversion of New Installation units into Service contracts and later into Modernization sales. We expect to
realize cost savings in an aggregate amount of €7 million related to our commercial operations initiatives.

As part of our service operations initiatives under the Transformation Program, we aim to improve our
organizational efficiency by rationalizing the number of our application engineers, reducing the number of
platforms in our offering, standardizing our service offering and reducing the number of our service centers,
particularly in the U.S. We intend to implement other measures under these initiatives as well, including improving
process, technology and performance management in order to increase the productivity of our service technicians.
We expect to realize cost savings in an aggregate amount of €15 million related to our service operations initiatives.

As part of our procurement initiatives under the Transformation Program, we intend to implement multiple
measures to reduce costs relating to our procurement activities. For the 2018/2019 Financial Year, we believe
that our estimated addressable cost base for procurement activities comprised €2.1 billion of direct costs and €0.5
billion of indirect costs. To reduce these costs, we intend to establish group-wide supply agreements with global
suppliers for key categories of direct materials, such as motors, cables and doors, including through leveraging
change-of-control provisions under our existing supplier agreements with local or regional suppliers. We also
expect to increase our focus on supplier driven innovation in connection with, among other things, tendering
processes. To pursue improvements in specification management, we seek to standardize purchases for complex
parts and establish business unit sourcing boards, which will act as advisory panels in key end markets to
promote best practices and streamline procurement processes. Furthermore, we continue to shift our relationships
with local suppliers to regional suppliers in order to both increase the number of sites served by our suppliers and
decrease the number of our total suppliers, resulting in increased efficiencies. We also continue to streamline the
amount and variety of individually supplied components in order to purchase bundles of different products and
higher volumes of specific products, resulting in improved purchasing ability. Moreover, where appropriate, we
target shifting to agreements with suppliers in low cost countries or otherwise shifting purchases from our
suppliers of local products to products sourced from low cost countries. In addition, we are working to utilize
both centralized regional lead-buyers to streamline demand-management processes and defined sourcing hubs to
allow for best value and benchmark sourcing through increased spend, price and margin transparency.
Furthermore, we expect to realize cost savings from our commercial operations initiatives that result in the
rationalization of our product offering and standardization of our SKUs. We expect to realize cost savings in an
aggregate amount of €132 million in connection with our procurement initiatives.

As part of our G&A cost savings initiatives under the Transformation Program, we aim to improve our
organizational efficiency and generate attrition savings through a leaner operating model, the shifting of
employees to low cost countries and increased automation, including within our shared service centers. We
expect to realize cost savings in an aggregate amount of €36 million related to our G&A cost savings initiatives.

As part of our other operational initiatives under the Transformation Program, we aim to reduce direct and
indirect personnel expenses and scrappage costs by decreasing the portion of poor quality production. We target
replicating the cost of poor quality levels that we have achieved at our Korean plant (where such costs are
estimated to be 0.6% of internal sales) at our other plants, particularly our Middleton plant. We also intend to
outsource parts and components and streamline production overhead and assembly processes to reduce costs. We
expect to realize cost savings in an aggregate amount of €50 million related to our other operational initiatives.

We expect to incur one-off costs amounting to between €240 and €294 million in connection with these
initiatives, mainly as a result of (i) voluntary redundancy, early retirement and other severance costs, (ii) staff
training costs, (iii) investments in IT to digitize, automate and streamline processes, (iv) investments in the
existing shared service centers in Europe, Brazil and the U.S., as well as potentially operating new, regional
centers in Eastern Europe and Asia and (v) consulting, financial and legal advisory fees in connection with
implementing these initiatives.

**_Core+ Strategy: Deliver additional value through innovation, digitalization and bolt-on acquisitions_**

Our Core+ strategy aims to deliver additional value by (i) focusing on disruptive innovation, (ii) monetizing IoT
opportunities, (iii) seeking opportunistic mergers and acquisitions and (iv) continuing the measures defined under
our Core strategy.

We have a long-standing German engineering heritage and a history of innovative digital solutions with the
potential to transform the Elevator and Escalator division. We are a leading innovator in the elevator and
escalator market and strive to address what we believe are fundamental technological challenges to better serve a
rapidly urbanizing society. For example, we estimate that up to 40% of usable space in buildings is utilized for
elevator shafts. Our TWIN elevator system combines two independent cars in one shaft in order to increase
efficiency and creates more usable area by using up to 25% less usable space than an ordinary elevator. The
TWIN elevator system’s unique value-add has made it a top choice for premier buildings around the world,
including the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, Germany, and the CMA Tower in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. We
believe that our MULTI elevator system, which is currently in the developing phase, has the potential to be even
more compelling to the market. MULTI is a rope-less elevator able to move both vertically and horizontally,
which will allow new architectural designs and unlimited building height and, we estimate, will use up to 30% to
50% less usable space than an ordinary elevator. We believe that our New Installation customers place a high
value on innovative solutions like TWIN and MULTI, which both have the potential to significantly increase the
usable area in buildings that is available for sale or rent.

We also aim to continue to monetize our IoT technologies more effectively in the future to create sustainable
business value and cash flow. By the 2021/2022 Financial Year, we aim to charge connection and monthly fees
to customers for using MAX, which already supported the servicing of over 129,000 units as of March 31, 2020.
Other innovations currently in the pipeline include our asset performance management solution as well as our
Intelligent Gate Management System, part of our Access Solutions division. We plan to follow the MAX
blueprint for these and other new products by clearly demonstrating the value of the product after launch,
bringing the technology to maturity and then developing a pricing and sales model that accurately reflects our
value to customers.

In addition, we have a track record of successful mergers and acquisitions, including most recently our
acquisitions of Nashville Machine’s elevator division and O’Keefe Elevator Company, Inc. in the 2018/2019
Financial Year. We plan to further develop our profit potential by opportunistically seeking future M&A targets,
which we believe can be value accretive to the Group.

**The Transactions**

**_The Acquisition_**

On February 26/27, 2020, Bidco, an entity indirectly owned by Advent and the Cinven Funds, entered into the
Share Purchase Agreement to acquire from the Seller all of the issued and outstanding share capital of the Target.
We currently expect the Acquisition to complete during the course of July 2020. The consummation of the
Acquisition is, however, subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including customary antitrust
and regulatory approvals and the performance of certain closing actions. Under the terms of the Share Purchase
Agreement, Bidco has agreed to take all necessary steps to obtain the required clearances following the signing
of the Share Purchase Agreement. If closing has not occurred on the date falling six months after the signing date
of the Share Purchase Agreement, the Share Purchase Agreement may be terminated.

The estimated sources and uses necessary to consummate the Transactions are shown in the table below. Actual
amounts will vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including the actual Acquisition
Closing Date, and the actual purchase price for the Acquisition, fluctuations in currency exchange rates for


11


-----

amounts not denominated in euro, the amount of the Equity Contribution or other sources made available and
differences between estimated and actual fees and expenses. In particular, the purchase price under the Share
Purchase Agreement as shown below reflects the agreed base consideration as adjusted for our estimates of an
agreed ticker fee accruing until the Acquisition Closing Date and certain notified cash leakage items, estimates of
the amount of various other liabilities transferred in connection with the sale (including pensions and leases),
certain payments arising as a result of the Transactions and certain other adjustments required under the Share
Purchase Agreement. This amount is expected to change depending on the timing of the Acquisition Closing
Date and a number of other factors.

(1) Represents the euro-equivalent of the aggregate amount we expect to draw under the Senior Term Facilities on or about the Acquisition
Closing Date. The commitment in respect of the USD TLA Facility and the USD TLB Facility is denominated in euros and will be
redenominated into U.S. dollars on or about the Acquisition Closing Date.

(2) Represents the euro-equivalent of the estimated gross proceeds of €1,750 million in aggregate principal amount of SSN EUR Notes and
€1,250,000,000 million (USD equivalent) in aggregate principal amount of SSN USD Notes.

(3) Represents the euro-equivalent of the estimated gross proceeds of €650 million in aggregate principal amount of SUN EUR Notes and
€400,000,000 million (USD equivalent) in aggregate principal amount of SUN USD Notes.

(4) Represents the euro-equivalent of the amount of gross proceeds of the Private Senior Notes which consist of a euro-denominated tranche
and a U.S. dollar-denominated tranche. The commitment in respect of the U.S. dollar-denominated tranche is denominated in euros and
will be redenominated into U.S. dollars on or about the Acquisition Closing Date.

(5) Represents the expected equity contributions (based on the agreed base consideration pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement) from
the Sponsors, thyssenkrupp AG, other co-investors and management, including the proceeds of the PIK Notes, in each case, in the form
of equity and subordinated shareholder funding. The amount of the equity contributions from the Sponsors and certain of its co-investors
may be increased or decreased if the fees and expenses are greater or less than our current estimate or as a result of purchase price
adjustments under the Share Purchase Agreement.

(6) Represents the agreed base consideration payable to the Seller pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement as adjusted for our estimates of
an agreed ticker fee accruing until the Acquisition Closing Date and certain notified cash leakage items, estimates of the amount of
various other liabilities transferred in connection with the sale (including pensions and leases), certain payments arising as a result of the
Transactions and certain other adjustments required under the Share Purchase Agreement. The purchase price under the SPA is
calculated as the agreed base consideration plus the agreed ticker fee from the locked box dated (September 30, 2019) until the closing
date minus certain notified leakage and adjustments for various other liabilities transferred in connection with the sale (including
pensions and leases), certain payments arising as a result of the Transactions and certain other adjustments required under the Share
Purchase Agreement. The purchase price will be paid in cash at closing, other than the purchase price portion attributable to the
reinvestment of thyssenkrupp AG which will be settled in kind by granting thyssenkrupp AG a participation in an indirect parent
company of the SUN Issuer. See “Summary—Summary Corporate and Financing Structure.”

(7) Represents estimated fees and expenses associated with the Transactions, including net interest expense that will accrue on proceeds of
the Notes deposited into escrow, underwriting, financial advisory, legal, accounting, ratings advisory and other transaction costs and
professional fees.

(8) Represents the minimum amount of operating cash of the Group as of the Acquisition Closing Date. Any cash in excess of this amount in
the Target Group as of the Acquisition Closing Date is expected (due to a related increase in the intercompany payables owed by the
Target Group to thyssenkrupp AG) to increase the purchase price and to be funded through the Revolving Credit Facility.

Under the Share Purchase Agreement, intercompany financing arrangements will be terminated prior to the
Acquisition Closing Date. In general, intercompany receivables owed to thyssenkrupp AG by the Target will need
to be acquired by the purchaser, subject to an additional purchase price, and all intercompany payables owed by
thyssenkrupp AG to the Target will be paid in cash to the Target on the Acquisition Closing Date. In addition, the
Share Purchase Agreement provides for a netting mechanism, pursuant to which, as of the Acquisition Closing
Date, there will be no intercompany receivables owed to thyssenkrupp AG by the Target that need to be acquired
and, instead, only intercompany payables owed by thyssenkrupp AG to the Target (if any) will remain outstanding.
Such intercompany payables will then be off-set against the purchase price for the Acquisition.

The Share Purchase Agreement contains customary warranties given by the Seller as to capacity, title and certain
business matters as well as customary signing to closing covenants given by the Seller regarding, among other


12


-----

things, the conduct of the business and the affairs of the Group pending closing of the Acquisition. The Seller’s
liability for any breach of a warranty is subject to certain thresholds and limitations. In addition, pursuant to the
Share Purchase Agreement, the Seller has agreed to take certain actions to facilitate the ability of the Group to
operate on a standalone basis, including, subject to certain exceptions, the provision of a number of services
pursuant to the New TSAs and the Additional Service Agreements, including relating to accounting and risk
services, IT, procurement, real estate, human resources, compliance, tax (in certain jurisdictions) and others, to
the Group, following the Acquisition. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Ongoing
_Relationships and Services Provided by the thyssenkrupp Group—Services provided by the thyssenkrupp Group_
_to the Group—Transitional Service Agreements (“TSAs”).”_

Further, subject to certain customary exceptions and excluding the reinvestment by thyssenkrupp AG in the
Group, the Seller has agreed that, for two years from the Acquisition Closing Date, neither it nor its subsidiaries
will, without Bidco’s written consent, engage in the territory in which the Group will conduct business as of the
Acquisition Closing Date, directly or indirectly, in the field of elevator business activities of the Group,
comprising the installation, modernization, servicing or maintenance of elevators, escalators, stair-lifts, moving
walks or passenger boarding bridges (as well as directly related ancillary activities, such as manufacturing and
designing of elevators, escalators, stair-lifts, moving walks or passenger boarding bridges).

Following the completion of the Acquisition, Bidco will hold 100% of the shares in the Target and we expect the
legal form of the Target will be changed from an Aktiengesellschaft to a Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung
shortly after closing.

Prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, Bidco will not have control over the board of directors of thyssenkrupp
Elevator. The board of directors of thyssenkrupp Elevator will be required, prior to the Acquisition Closing Date,
to manage thyssenkrupp Elevator under its own responsibility and in a manner that is in the best interests of
thyssenkrupp Elevator. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—The Issuers do not currently
_control the Target and will not control the Target until the Acquisition Closing Date.”_

**_Escrow Accounts_**

Pending the consummation of the Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers will deposit the gross proceeds from the
Offering of the Notes into the Escrow Accounts in the names of the Issuers. The Escrow Accounts will be
controlled by the Escrow Agent and will be pledged on a first-priority basis in favor of the Trustee on behalf of
the holders of the respective series of the Notes. See “Summary—The Offering—Collateral.”

The release of the Escrowed Property from the Escrow Accounts is subject to the satisfaction of certain
conditions, including that the funds required to pay the consideration for the Acquisition will be applied promptly
(and in any event within two business days). See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Escrow of Proceeds;
_Special Mandatory Redemption” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory_
_Redemption.” If these conditions are not satisfied on or before the Escrow Longstop Date or upon the occurrence_
of certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption. The special mandatory
redemption price for the Notes will be equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price of the Notes plus accrued and
unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of such special mandatory redemption.
See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,”
“Description of the Senior Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” and “Risk Factors—
_Risks Relating to the Transactions—If the conditions precedent to the release of the Escrowed Property are not_
_satisfied, the Issuers will be required to redeem the Notes, but the Escrow Accounts may not have sufficient funds_
_to cover such redemption without relying on the Escrow Equity Commitment.”_

In the event of a special mandatory redemption, the SUN Issuer, in the case of the Senior Secured Notes, and
Vertical Topco III, in the case of the Senior Notes, will be required to fund the relevant Issuer in such aggregate
amounts as are required in order to enable the Issuers to pay any funding shortfall, including Escrow Account fees,
negative interest on the Escrow Accounts’ balances and costs and accrued and unpaid interest and additional
amounts, if any, owing to the holders of the Notes on such special mandatory redemption date (the “Escrow Equity
Commitment”), pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter. The holders of the Notes will not have any direct right
to enforce the Escrow Equity Commitment, and must rely on the Issuers’ respective rights to enforcement under the
Escrow Equity Commitment. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special
_Mandatory Redemption,” “Description of the Senior Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption”_
and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—If the conditions precedent to the release of the Escrowed
_Property are not satisfied, the Issuers will be required to redeem the Notes, but the Escrow Accounts may not have_
_sufficient funds to cover such redemption without relying on the Escrow Equity Commitment.”_

**Recent Developments**

**_Coronavirus (COVID-19)_**

Since January 2020, there has been a progressive global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in various
actions, including lockdowns, by governments across the world in order to contain and control the virus.
COVID-19 has impacted markets and facilities in multiple ways, depending on the local exposure to the virus
and the measures taken by local governments.

Our Asia/Pacific, Americas and Europe/Africa segments, which comprise our Elevator and Escalator division,
have been affected in varying degrees. The effect of COVID-19 was felt in all regions, leading to complete
lockdowns in some regions and milder restrictions in others. In the Asia/Pacific region, temporary restrictions
were mainly observed in China after a full lockdown of manufacturing sites in February 2020 due to government
restrictions, but with recovery to almost normal operations in March 2020. India has also been affected by
government restrictions and our facility in Pune is currently ramping up its operations. In the Americas, some
reductions were observed in Brazil, while production in the United States remained mainly at normal levels, with
only temporary restrictions on construction sites and service operations. In the Europe/Africa segment, Spain,
France, Italy and Germany were the most impacted countries, with some site restrictions and temporary
reductions or lockdowns in productions facilities.

The Access Solutions division has been affected in each of its home solutions and airport solutions offerings.
Activities for home solutions have been operating at a lower level with partial temporary shutdowns of
production facilities, but are recovering constantly. The partial or complete shutdown of most airports has led to
a decrease of New Installation and Service operations due to postponements and suspensions of some projects.

We have implemented a contingency plan headed by a steering committee consisting of members of our
Management Board. Our contingency plan focuses on the health and safety of our workforce, cash flexibility,
workforce flexibility, business continuity, sales push and communication. Cash management measures revolve
around personnel savings, tight working capital management and a capital expenditure freeze. Around 15,000
employees are currently affected by these contingency measures, which include funded and non-funded
furloughs and overtime reduction.

Despite the negative global macroeconomic outlook as a result of COVID-19, we believe that in the medium to
long term, the outbreak will not have a material adverse effect on our overall business and results of operations,
due to the underlying resilience of our business and immediate implementation of contingency measures. Our
New Installation business was temporarily impacted in countries with lockdown measures, as discussed above.
However, all our manufacturing plants are currently operational. Our Service business has performed largely as
expected, given applicable safety and regulatory requirements.

However, the COVID-19 pandemic has been evolving rapidly and we are unable to predict how the outbreak may
affect our business in the future. We continue to monitor the situation to ensure the safety of our employees, react
to any operational developments, logistics disruptions and macroeconomic fluctuations and assess the ongoing
impact of developments on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.

_preliminary management accounts, including certain segmental information extracted therefrom, is preliminary_
_and is subject to financial closing procedures which have not yet been completed. In particular, our Financial_
_Statements and thyssenkrupp AG’s segmental information are not prepared on the same basis, and therefore,_
_while we believe these preliminary results and estimates to be reasonable, our actual results could vary from_
_these estimates and these differences could be material. As such, you should not place undue reliance on this_

_or any future period. See “Forward looking Statements,” “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and_
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this offering memorandum for a more complete_
_discussion of certain of the factors that could affect our future performance._

_One Month Ended April 30, 2020_

Based on thyssenkrupp AG’s preliminary management accounts, including certain segmental information derived
therefrom, we estimate that our sales for the one-month period ending April 30, 2020, was approximately
€617 million compared to sales of approximately €671 million in the corresponding period in 2019, representing
a decrease of 8%.

We estimate that our Adjusted EBIT was approximately €53 million for the one-month period ending April 30,
2020, compared to approximately €70 million in the corresponding period in 2019 after giving effect to estimated
additional standalone corporate costs in the 2019/2020 Financial Year of €30 million per annum distributed
equally across each one-month period in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. The change in Adjusted EBIT represents
a decrease of 24%.

We estimate that our Adjusted EBIT margin was approximately 8.6% for the one-month period ending April 30,
2020, compared to approximately 10.4% in the corresponding period in 2019, representing a decrease of 1.8%
points.

We estimate that our order intake was approximately €645 million for the one-month period ending April 30, 2020,
compared to approximately €648 million in the corresponding period in 2019, representing a decrease of 0.5%.

We estimate that our business cash flow (pre-restructuring) was approximately €166 million for the one-month
period ending April 30, 2020, compared to approximately €101 million in the corresponding period in 2019 after
giving effect to estimated additional standalone corporate costs in the 2019/2020 Financial Year of €30 million
per annum distributed equally across each one-month period in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. The change in
business cash flow (pre-restructuring) represents an increase of 65%.

Our results for the one-month period ending April 30, 2020, were mainly driven by the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic, together with strong development in business cash flow showing positive development in all
Operating Segments.

_One Month Ended May 31, 2020_

Based on thyssenkrupp AG’s preliminary management accounts, including certain segmental information derived
therefrom, we estimate that our sales for the one-month period ended May 31, 2020, was approximately
€634 million compared to sales of approximately €689 million in the corresponding period in 2019, representing
a decrease of 8%.

We estimate that our Adjusted EBIT was approximately €70 million for the one-month period ended May 31,
2020, compared to approximately €74 million in the corresponding period in 2019 after giving effect to estimated
additional standalone corporate costs in the 2019/2020 Financial Year of €30 million per annum distributed
equally across each one-month period in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. The change in Adjusted EBIT represents
a decrease of 6%.

We estimate that our Adjusted EBIT margin was approximately 11.0% for the one-month period ended May 31,
2020, compared to approximately 10.8% in the corresponding period in 2019, representing an increase of 0.2%.

period ended May 31, 2020, compared to approximately €71 million in the corresponding period in 2019 after
giving effect to estimated additional standalone corporate costs in the 2019/2020 Financial Year of €30 million
per annum distributed equally across each one-month period in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. The change in
business cash flow (pre-restructuring) represents an increase of 46%.

Our results for the one-month period ended May 31, 2020 were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, while
sales and Adjusted EBIT were showing notable recovery compared to the one-month period ended April 30,
2020 together with a continued strong development in business cash flow.

**_Current Forecast_**

_The following is a discussion of our expected performance for the financial year ending September 30, 2020,_
_which we have estimated based on certain information available to us as of the date of this offering_
_memorandum._ _Such_ _information_ _primarily_ _includes_ _certain_ _information_ _from_ _our_ _Unaudited_ _Interim_
_Consolidated Financial Statements and the preliminary financial information as of and for the one-month period_
_ended April 30, 2020 and the one-month period ended May 31, 2020, which was derived from our preliminary_
_management accounts. Information derived from management accounts is preliminary and subject to financial_
_closing procedures which have not yet been completed, and may not be comparable to the information we will_
_prepare after the completion of the Transactions. Our independent auditor has not audited, reviewed, compiled,_
_or applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to such preliminary financial information and, accordingly,_
_does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The combined basis of_
_preparation reflects the accounting for the carveout of the Elevator Technology Business, but differs in important_
_ways from the basis of preparation of the results for thyssenkrupp Elevator Technology Group as they will be_
_reported in the future. As a result, this forward-looking information may not necessarily be prepared on a_
_comparable basis to the financial information that the thyssenkrupp Elevator Technology Group will report in_
_respect of the year ended September 30, 2020. In addition, the following forward-looking discussion is based on_
_certain assumptions and judgments, including, among other things, that a “second wave” of the COVID-19_
_pandemic will not occur, that local governments in the regions in which we operate will not reinstate lock-down_
_and other measures that they had implemented in response to the outbreak of COVID-19 and subsequently eased_
_or eliminated, that there will be no deterioration of general economic conditions or adverse regulatory changes,_
_that no escalation in trade disputes will occur between the United States and China or other countries that have_
_a material impact on our business, that central bank and government fiscal stimulus activity will not decrease in_
_a material way, that our customers’ preferences and purchasing patterns will revert to historical averages, and_
_that the levels of competition in our industry will not increase from historical levels. While we believe that these_
_assumptions are reasonable, the discussion below constitutes forward-looking information, which is by its nature_
_subject to significant uncertainty. Any of the bases for our expectations may prove to be incorrect, we cannot_
_assure you that we have taken all factors into account that could impact our results of operations for the_
_financial year ending September 30, 2020, and our performance may be affected by a number of known and_
_unknown risks and uncertainties, including the actual development of the COVID-19 pandemic or any of the_
_other factors and uncertainties described elsewhere in this offering memorandum. Many of these risks and_
_uncertainties are beyond our control, and could cause our actual results and performance to differ materially_
_from any expected future results or performance expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements_
_included herein. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on the following discussion as a prediction of_
_actual results or otherwise. Neither our independent auditors, nor any other independent accountants, have_
_compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect to the forecast presented below, nor have they_
_expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability, and assume no_
_responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, the forecast. We undertake no obligation to publicly update_
_or revise the discussion below or any other forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information,_
_future events or otherwise. Our future reported results may differ materially from the forward-looking_
_information presented below. See “Forward looking Statements,” “Risk Factors” and “Management’s_
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this offering memorandum for a_
_more complete discussion of certain of the factors that could affect our future performance._

Following our solid levels of New Installation order intake, completed maintenance visits and manufacturing
activity in China, Europe and the United States for the two months ended May 31, 2020, we currently estimate
that our order intake, sales and Adjusted EBIT is normalizing moving forward. For the financial year ending
September 30, 2020, we expect that our order intake, sales and Adjusted EBIT will range from remaining stable
to being down by single digit percentage points, each as compared to the prior year. For the financial year ended
September 30, 2019, our order intake, sales and Adjusted EBIT were €8,172 million, €7,961 million and €819
million, respectively.

_the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests.” The security interests in favor of the Notes and the Note_
Guarantees may be released under certain circumstances.

(8) The EUR SSN Issuer is offering €750 million in aggregate principal amount of its SSN EUR Fixed Notes and €1,000 million in

security interests in favor of the Notes and the Note Guarantees may be released under certain circumstances. For the twelve months
ended March 31, 2020, on a consolidated basis and excluding statistical corporate cost allocations, the Post-Closing Guarantors generated
62.8% of the Group’s consolidated EBITDA and 44.5% of the Group’s consolidated sales. As of March 31, 2020, on a consolidated basis

of the Escrowed Property, the first-priority security interests over the
Escrowed Property will be released.

In addition, on the Issue Date, the Senior Notes and Note Guarantees
thereof will be secured by (collectively, the “SUN Collateral” and together
with the SSN Collateral and the Escrow Charges, the “Collateral”):

interests in the SSN Post-Closing Collateral or any other of the SSN
Collateral. See “Description _of_ _Certain_ _Financing_ _Arrangements—_

The security interests may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain
defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability. For more
information on the security interests granted, see “Description of the Senior
_Notes—Security,” and for more information on potential limitations to the_
security interests, see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and

**Use of Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The proceeds from the Offering of the Notes, together with borrowings
under the Senior Term Facilities, the proceeds from the Private Senior
Notes and the Equity Contribution will be used to (i) fund the consideration
payable for the Acquisition and (ii) pay the fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the Transactions. See “Use of Proceeds.”

**Additional Amounts . . . . . . . . . . .** Any payments made by the Issuers or any Guarantor with respect to the
Notes or Note Guarantees will be made without withholding or deduction
for taxes unless required by law. If such withholding or deduction is
required by law in any “relevant taxing jurisdiction,” the Issuers or the
relevant Guarantor, as applicable, will pay the additional amounts necessary
so that the net amounts received after the withholding or deduction is not
less than the amount that would have been received in the absence of the
withholding or deduction, subject to certain exceptions. See “Description of
_the Senior Secured Notes—Withholding Taxes” and “Description of the_
_Senior Notes—Withholding Taxes.”_

**Optional Redemption:**

Fixed Rate Notes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . All or a portion of the Fixed Rate Notes may be redeemed at any time prior
to, 2023, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount of the relevant series of Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid
interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption
date plus a “make-whole” premium, as described in this offering
memorandum.

Prior to, 2023, the Issuers may in each calendar year redeem

Rate Notes (including any additional Fixed Rate Notes of the same series)
at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount thereof plus
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but
excluding, the redemption date.

At any time prior to, 2023, up to 40% of the aggregate
principal amount of each series of Fixed Rate Notes may be redeemed with
the net proceeds of one or more specified equity offerings at a redemption
price equal to %, %, % and % in respect of the SSN

-----

EUR Fixed Notes, SSN USD Notes, SUN USD Notes and SUN EUR
Notes, respectively, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, provided
that at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of such series of
Fixed Rate Notes (including any additional Fixed Rate Notes) remains
outstanding, after the redemption (unless all Fixed Rate Notes of such series
are redeemed substantially concurrently).

The Fixed Rate Notes may be redeemed at any time on or after
, 2023, at the redemption prices set forth in price set forth
under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Optional Redemption”
and “Description _of_ _the_ _Senior_ _Notes—Optional_ _Redemption,”_ as
applicable.

SSN EUR FRN Notes . . . . . . . . . . All or a portion of the SSN EUR FRN Notes may be redeemed at any time
prior to, 2021, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the SSN EUR FRN Notes redeemed plus accrued and
unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the
redemption date plus a “make-whole” premium, as described in this
offering memorandum.

The SSN EUR FRN Notes may be redeemed at any time on or after
, 2021, at the redemption prices set forth in Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes—Optional Redemption.”_

**Optional Redemption for Tax**
**Reasons . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** In the event of certain developments affecting taxation that become
effective on or after the Issue Date, an Issuer may redeem the applicable
series of Notes in whole but not in part, at any time, upon giving written
notice, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, and additional amounts, if any, to, but
excluding, the date of redemption. See “Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes—Redemption for Taxation Reasons” and “Description of the Senior_
_Notes—Redemption for Taxation Reasons.”_

**Change of Control . . . . . . . . . . . .** Upon the occurrence of certain defined events constituting a change of
control or upon certain asset sales, each holder of Notes of any series may
require the relevant Issuer, as applicable, to repurchase all or a portion of
the Notes of such series at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount
plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but
excluding, the redemption date. However, a change of control will not be
deemed to have occurred if, pro forma for such change of control, a
specified consolidated total net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection
with such event. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Change of
_Control” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Change of Control.”_

**Escrow Proceeds; Special**
**Mandatory Redemption . . . . .** Concurrently with the closing of the Offering, and pending consummation
of the Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers will deposit the gross proceeds of
the Offering into the Escrow Accounts, held in the name of the relevant
Issuer. The Escrow Accounts will be controlled by the Escrow Agent, and
pledged on a first-priority basis in favor of the Trustee on behalf of the
holders of the respective series of Notes. The release of the proceeds
deposited in the Escrow Accounts will be subject to the satisfaction of
certain conditions, including that the funds required to pay the consideration
for the Acquisition will be applied promptly (and in any event within two
business days). Upon delivery to the Trustee and the Escrow Agent of an
officer’s certificate stating that the conditions to the release of the proceeds
from escrow are satisfied, the Escrowed Property will be released to the
Issuers and utilized as described in “Use of Proceeds,” “Description of the


28


-----

_Senior_ _Secured_ _Notes—Escrow_ _of_ _Proceeds;_ _Special_ _Mandatory_
_Redemption” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Escrow of Proceeds;_
_Special Mandatory Redemption.” If the conditions to the release of the_
Escrowed Property have not been satisfied on or prior to the business day
immediately following the Escrow Longstop Date, or upon the occurrence
of certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory
redemption.

The special mandatory redemption price of the Notes will be equal to 100%
of the aggregate issue price of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest
and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, such special mandatory
redemption date.

In the event of a special mandatory redemption, the SUN Issuer, in the case
of the Senior Secured Notes, and Vertical Topco III, in the case of the
Senior Notes, will be required to fund the relevant Issuer in such aggregate
amounts as are required in order to enable the Issuers to pay any funding
shortfall, including Escrow Account fees, negative interest on the Escrow
Accounts’ balances and costs and accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any, owing to the holders of the Notes on such
special mandatory redemption date (the “Escrow Equity Commitment”),
pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter. The holders of the Notes will
not have any direct right to enforce the Escrow Equity Commitment, and
must rely on the Issuers’ respective rights to enforcement under the Escrow
Equity Commitment.

In addition, the conditions applicable to the special mandatory redemption
may be waived by holders of the Notes representing a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes outstanding.

See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Escrow of Proceeds;
_Special Mandatory Redemption,” “Description of the Senior Notes—Escrow_
_of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,” and “Risk Factors—Risks_
_Relating to the Transactions—If the conditions precedent to the release of_
_the Escrowed Property are not satisfied, the Issuers will be required to_
_redeem the Notes, but the Escrow Accounts may not have sufficient funds to_
_cover such redemption without relying on the Escrow Equity Commitment.”_

**Certain Covenants . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Indentures will limit, among other things, the ability of the Issuers and
the restricted subsidiaries to:

                      - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred
stock;

                      - create or incur certain liens;

                      - make certain restricted payments;

                      - make certain investments;

                      - impose restrictions on the ability of their subsidiaries to pay dividends
or make other payments to the Issuers;

                      - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

                      - transfer, receive or sell certain assets including subsidiary stock;

                      - consolidate or merge with other entities; and

                      - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes.

Each of the covenants in Indentures is subject to significant exceptions and
qualifications. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain
_Covenants” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Certain Covenants.”_

particular, you should evaluate the specific risk factors set forth in the “Risk
_Factors” section before making a decision whether to invest in the Notes._

**No Prior Market . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes will be new securities for which there is currently no market.
Although the Initial Purchasers of the Notes have advised us that they
intend to make a market in the Notes, they are not obligated to do so and
they may discontinue market making at any time without notice.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that an active trading market will
develop for the Notes.

**SUMMARY FINANCIAL AND OTHER DATA**

_The following tables present our summary financial information and have been derived from, and should be read_
_in conjunction with, our Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Interim Consolidated_
_Financial Statements that have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and are included elsewhere herein and_
_the sections entitled “Presentation of Financial Information”, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of_
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, “Selected Financial Information”, “Use of Proceeds” and_
_“Capitalization”._

_We have extracted (i) the combined historical financial information of the Elevator Technology Business for the_
_2016/2017, 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 Financial Years from the Audited Combined Financial Statements and_
_(ii) the consolidated historical financial information of the Elevator Technology Business as of and for the six_
_months ended March 31, 2019 and 2020 from the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements, in each_
_case, included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. As the Elevator Technology Business did not exist as a_
_separate group and since all companies and operating activities within the Elevator Technology Business were_
_under the common control of thyssenkrupp AG, in each case, prior to the Reorganization, the financial_
_information presented as of and for the financial years ended September 30, 2017, 2018 and 2019 has been_
_prepared on a combined basis. Effective with the Reorganization, the Elevator Technology Business came into_
_existence as a separate group and therefore, the financial information presented for the Target and its_
_consolidated subsidiaries as of and for the six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2020 was prepared on a_
_consolidated basis. There are important differences between the Elevator Technology Business as presented in_
_the Audited Combined Financials as of and for the 2016/2017, 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 Financial Years and_
_the business carried out by the Target and its subsidiaries as presented in the Unaudited Interim Consolidated_
_Financial Statements as of and for the six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2020. See “Presentation of_
_Financial Information—Basis of Preparation” and our Financial Statements included elsewhere herein._

_The independent auditor’s report on the Audited Combined Financial Statements is qualified due to issues_
_regarding local book keeping and financial reporting processes, which led to qualified, adverse or disclaimer of_
_opinions on the financial information of certain entities of the Elevator Technology Business’s Operating Unit_
_Spanish Latin America in several instances as of September 30, 2018 and 2017 and for the financial years ended_
_September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The auditor’s qualification does not pertain to the combined statement of_
_financial position as of September 30, 2019 included in the Audited Combined Financial Statements. In the_
_Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements, the issues relating to the Elevator Technology Business’s_
_Operating Unit Spanish Latin America described above still remained for the six-month period ended March 31,_
_2019. See “Presentation of Financial Information” and our Financial Statements included elsewhere herein._

_The financial information of the Group for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020, is unaudited and has been_
_calculated by taking the financial information for the six months ended March 31, 2020 (as derived from the_
_Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements) and adding it to the difference between the results of_
_operations for the year ended September 30, 2019 (as derived from the Audited Combined Financial Statements)_
_and the interim financial information for the six months ended March 31, 2019 (as derived from the Unaudited_
_Interim Consolidated Financial Statements)._

_The financial information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020 constitutes a Non-GAAP Measure (as_
_defined below), has not been audited or reviewed by our auditors, is not required by or presented in accordance_
_with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles and has been prepared for illustrative purpose_
_only. This information is not necessarily representative of our results of operations for such period or any future_
_period or any financial position at any past or future date._

_This offering memorandum also includes certain unaudited pro forma financial information of the SUN Issuer_
_and the EUR SSN Issuer as of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020, including pro forma net senior_
_secured indebtedness, pro forma net indebtedness and pro forma interest expense, which has been prepared to_
_illustrate the effect of the Transactions as if the Transactions had occurred (i) on March 31, 2020, for the_
_purposes of calculating pro forma net senior secured indebtedness and pro forma net indebtedness and (ii) on_
_April 1, 2019, for the purposes of calculating pro forma interest expense. The pro forma financial information as_
_of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020, has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and does_
_not represent what our indebtedness or interest expense would have been had the Transactions occurred on_
_March 31, 2020, or April 1, 2019, respectively; nor does it purport to project our financial results, indebtedness_
_or interest expense at any future date. The pro forma financial information as of and for the twelve months ended_
_March 31, 2020, has not been prepared in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting_

-----

_standards or in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the Securities Act, the Prospectus_
_Regulation, or any other regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or any other regulator._
_Neither the assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments nor the resulting pro forma financial information_
_as of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020, have been audited or reviewed in accordance with any_
_generally accepted auditing standards._
_Results of operations for prior years or periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the_
_full year or any future period. Prospective investors should bear in mind that certain performance indicators and_
_ratios that we report herein, such as Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBIT margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA_

_conversion, EBIT, EBIT margin, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, free cash flow, Lease Adjusted EBITDA, operating net_
_working capital, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and other figures for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020, are_
_not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS, U.S. GAAP, German GAAP or any other generally_
_accepted accounting principles, should not be considered as alternatives to performance measures derived in_
_accordance with IFRS, U.S. GAAP, German GAAP or any other generally accepted accounting principles, may not_
_be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies, have limitations as analytical tools and should_

(1) Capital expenditures for the 2018/2019 Financial Year include carve-out related items, specifically the fee paid in relation to the
licensing agreement for the rights to use the thyssenkrupp brand (€1,080 million) and the payments for carve-out related real estate
transfers (€74 million).

Capital expenditures for the six months ended March 31, 2020 include €3,340 million in purchase costs paid in connection with the
Reorganization.

(2) Because we adopted IFRS 16 on October 1, 2019, IFRS 16 was not applicable during the 2016/2017, 2017/2018 and 2018/2019
Financial Years or for the six months ended March 30, 2019. The six month period ended March 31, 2020, in which IFRS 16 was

adopted for the first time, excludes €19 million due to carve-out effects for the multifunctional building, Neuhausen, using the modified
accounting treatment. Corresponding cash out has been recognized within carve-out effects in the 2018/2019 Financial Year in the course
of the advance payment.

(3) Represents customer orders that were completed but not invoiced at period-end.

(4) Represents customer orders that were received but not completed at period-end.

(5) Represents the ratio of customer orders received to customer orders invoiced.

(6) We believe that business cash flow (post-restructuring) and the other cash flow metrics set forth below are useful to investors because
they provide a comprehensive overview of the cash items relating to our business. Set forth below is a reconciliation of business cash
flow (post-restructuring) to operating cash flows which we believe is its closest comparable IFRS measure:

related real estate transfers (€74 million).

Cash flow from investing activities for the six months ended March 31, 2020 includes €3,340 million in purchase costs paid in

Reorganization.

(1) We define EBIT as income/(loss) before tax, finance income, finance expense and “thyssenkrupp” brand charges, but including certain
finance expenses and finance income assigned to EBIT based on economic classification. We define Adjusted EBIT as EBIT, as adjusted
for special items as described below. We define Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBIT, as adjusted further by adding back depreciation
and amortization expense. We define Lease Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA, as adjusted further for the estimated effect of our
adoption of IFRS 16 as if it had been adopted at the beginning of each period presented. See “Presentation of Financial Information—
_Non-GAAP Financial Measures—General” for further information on how Lease Adjusted EBITDA is calculated. We define Pro Forma_
Adjusted EBITDA as Lease Adjusted EBITDA, as adjusted further for certain cost savings adjustments as set forth in the tables below.
EBIT, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBITDA, Lease Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA are collectively referred to herein
as our “EBITDA-based measures.”

We believe that our EBITDA-based measures are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance and our ability to incur and
service our indebtedness. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is adjusted for certain items that we believe
are not indicative of our underlying operating performance. We believe that Lease Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it
gives pro forma effect to the application of IFRS 16 as if it had been adopted at the beginning of the relevant period. See “Presentation of
_Financial Information—Non-GAAP Financial Measures—General” for further information on how Lease Adjusted EBITDA is_
calculated. We believe that Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it gives effect to cost saving initiatives we expect
to implement after the Transactions.

Our EBITDA-based measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered
as alternatives to performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles. Our
EBITDA-based measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and have limitations as analytical
tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA and the other EBITDA-based measures presented herein differ from Consolidated EBITDA as defined in the
Indentures governing the Notes. Because of these limitations, our EBITDA-based measures should not be considered as measures of
discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to service our
indebtedness. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our Financial Statements included elsewhere herein
and using these non-GAAP measures only to supplement evaluation of our performance. See “Presentation of Financial Information—
_Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”_

(A) Represents non-recurring expenses in relation to our use of the “thyssenkrupp” brand. In the periods up to September 30, 2019, the
Elevator Technology Business was using the “thyssenkrupp” brand under an operating licensing model for which it incurred license
fees recognized in profit or loss in other expenses. As of September 30, 2019, the operating licensing model was terminated and
thus the license fees we incurred in prior periods are non-recurring and have been added back to EBIT. On September 30, 2019, the
Elevator Technology Business entered into a new license agreement with the remaining thyssenkrupp Group for the right to use the
“thyssenkrupp” brand for certain classified classes relevant for the Elevator Technology Business in exchange for a one-time fee
and with no other recurring expenses after September 30, 2019. In connection with the Acquisition, the License Agreement was
amended in March 2020, resulting in the intangible asset representing the right of use of the “thyssenkrupp” brand to be classified as
held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 in the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. The re-classification resulted
in a non-recurring, non-cash impairment charge against the intangible asset, which we have added back to EBIT. See “Certain
_Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Relationships with the thyssenkrupp Group in the Past—License Agreement” and_
Note 1 to the Audited Combined Financial Statements and to the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements.

(B) Represents restructuring expenses and net impairment losses plus certain other non-operating income and expense items if such
items individually exceed a de minimis threshold of €0.5 million. In the periods presented, the majority of our restructuring costs
relate to cost savings programs and operational improvement measures implemented at our European factories, our French, Spanish
and German operations and our US operations. The large majority of our net impairment losses in Financial Year 2017 was due to
the impairment of trade accounts receivable following a restructuring program in the Middle East, which had been initiated in 2016.
Other special items include mainly (i) non-recurring costs related to project re-evaluations following the restructuring program in
the Middle East in Financial Year 2016/2017, (ii) restructuring costs in Europe/Africa; legal fees, penalties and remediation costs
following inspections in Ontario, Canada and impairments of receivables and inventories in the Middle East in the 2017/2018
Financial Year and (iii) restructuring related costs in Europe/Africa and an unclaimed properties provision (€24 million) already
partially recorded previously by thyssenkrupp and then allocated to the Elevator Technology Business in the Financial Year
2018/2019.

(C) Because we adopted IFRS 16 on October 1, 2019, our income statement information is presented in accordance with IAS 17 for all
periods ended on or prior to September 30, 2019, whereas it is presented in accordance with IFRS 16 for all periods thereafter. Our
transition to IFRS 16 resulted in an increase of interest expense on leases, an increase of depreciation of lease assets and a decrease
of rent expenses on operating leases. Because interest expense and depreciation are both expenses that are added back to net income
in calculating Adjusted EBITDA, our adoption of IFRS 16 had a positive impact on our Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended
March 31, 2020. We present Lease Adjusted EBITDA to illustrate the estimated impact IFRS 16 would have had on our Adjusted

-----

EBITDA for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020 if we had adopted IFRS 16 on April 1, 2019. See “Presentation of Financial
_Information—Non-GAAP Financial Measures—General” for further information on how Lease Adjusted EBITDA is calculated._

(D) Our Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, has been negatively impacted by corporate cost
allocations from thyssenkrupp AG that we do not consider to be representative of our standalone costs going forward because they
were allocated retrospectively in accordance with carve-out accounting principles. These cost allocations were calculated as a
proportion of thyssenkrupp AG’s overall corporate costs, based on allocation metrics such as revenue contribution of the Elevator
Technology Business rather than a systematic review of the organization, FTEs and infrastructure that would be required to perform
the relevant functions as a stand-alone business, and negatively impacted our Adjusted EBITDA by €98 million, €71 million,
€73 million, €30 million and €16 million in the 2016/2017 Financial Year, 2017/2018 Financial Year, 2018/2019 Financial Year,
the six months ended March 31, 2019 and the three months ended December 31, 2019, respectively. We incurred actual standalone
costs of €10 million in the three months ended March 31, 2020, which included some ramp-up costs that we do not expect to
continue, and thus estimate that our actual standalone costs will amount to approximately €30 million per annum going forward. We
have therefore taken (i) the €69 million of our combined corporate cost allocations and actual standalone costs during the twelve
months ended March 31, 2020 less (ii) our €30 million estimate of actual standalone costs per annum going forward, and added the
difference back to Adjusted EBITDA. While we build up additional governance and other functions, the relevant corporate services
that comprise part of these standalone costs will be provided to by thyssenkrupp AG via a combination of direct service agreements
and the New TSAs, which may impact our estimate of these costs in the short term. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Corporate cost allocations.”_

(E) In connection with the Acquisition, Advent and Cinven commissioned a third-party due diligence report from a global consulting
firm to analyze the financial condition and operations of the Elevator Technology Business and its potential for achieving cost
savings. This report has identified €240 million in potential cost savings, which we expect to realize through our Transformation
Program within 15 to 18 months after July 1, 2020. We give effect to these cost saving initiatives in calculating Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA as if the underlying cost savings had been realized on April 1, 2019. We expect to incur one-off costs amounting to
between €240 and €294 million in connection with these initiatives, mainly as a result of (i) voluntary redundancy, early retirement
and other severance costs, (ii) staff training costs, (iii) investments in IT to digitize, automate and streamline processes,
(iv) investments in existing shared service centers in Europe, Brazil and the U.S., as well as potentially operating new, regional
centers in Eastern Europe and Asia and (v) consulting, financial and legal advisory fees in connection with implementing these
initiatives. The cost savings adjustments set forth in the following table are based on various assumptions and estimates by external
consultants and management regarding the future impact of our cost saving initiatives, including that implementation of the
Transformation Program will commence on July 1, 2020 and will be driven by key management, including the Chief Executive
Officer of the Target, even prior to the Acquisition Closing Date. We believe this assumption is reasonable because some of the
initiatives under the Transformation Program are a continuation of the Target’s existing efficiency measures and the Acquisition is
expected to complete during the course of July 2020. This information is inherently subject to significant business, economic and
competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those assumed in the adjustments
below. As a result, while we believe that these adjustments and potential cost savings are reasonable estimates, the actual results and
cost savings in any given period may differ from those estimated herein, including because much of the savings we expect to
achieve are from procurement initiatives which depend on negotiations with third-party suppliers that are outside our control. We
may not be able to realize these cost savings, either in the amount or within the timeframe we currently anticipate, and the costs of
achieving these cost savings may be higher than expected. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—We may fail to
_achieve the targeted benefits from restructuring and operational improvement measures” and “Forward-Looking Statements.”_

(a) Represents expected cost savings related to our commercial operations initiatives, comprising (i) €2 million of cost savings
from organizational efficiency as a result of restructuring and centralizing our sales support teams, including by shifting FTEs
to low cost countries, and (ii) €5 million of cost savings from sales force productivity measures, such as administrative process
improvements, faster technical sales due to offering fewer customization options and beginning the process (which we expect
to take several years) of reducing our offering from 52 to 25 elevator platforms and from nine to five escalator platforms and an
increased focus on sales efforts based on product margin potentials and the conversion of New Installation units into Service
contracts and later into Modernizations sales.

(b) Represents expected cost savings related to our service operations initiatives, comprising (i) €4 million of cost savings from
organizational efficiency, including the rationalization of the number of our application engineers, as a result of reducing the
number of platforms in our offering and standardizing our services, (ii) €2 million of cost savings from a reduction in the
number of our service centers, particularly in the U.S. and (iii) €9 million of cost savings from other initiatives, such as
increased productivity of service technicians through process, technology and performance management improvements.


38


-----

(c) Represents expected cost savings related to our procurement initiatives, comprising:

i. €45 million of cost savings from (1) the establishment of group-wide supply agreements with global suppliers for key
categories of direct materials, such as motors, cables and doors, including through leveraging change-of-control
provisions under our existing supplier agreements with local or regional suppliers, (2) increased focus on supplier driven
innovation in connection with, among other things, tendering processes, (3) improvements in specification management
by standardizing purchases for complex parts and (4) the establishment of business unit sourcing boards to act as advisory
panels in key end markets to promote best practices and streamline procurement processes;

ii. €11 million of cost savings from shifting from local suppliers to regional suppliers to increase the number of sites served
by our suppliers and decrease the number of our total suppliers in order to improve efficiencies;

iii. €25 million of cost savings from shifting from local suppliers to regional suppliers to streamline the amount and variety of
individually supplied components in order to purchase bundles of different products and higher volumes of specific
products to improve purchasing ability;

iv. €17 million of cost savings from shifting purchases from our suppliers of local products to products sourced from low cost
countries; and

v. €34 million of cost savings from other initiatives, such as (1) the utilization of centralized regional lead-buyers to
streamline demand-management processes and of defined sourcing hubs to allow for best value and benchmark sourcing
through increased spend, price and margin transparency, (2) shifting to suppliers in low cost countries and (3) our
commercial operations initiatives to rationalize our product offering and standardize our SKUs.

The estimated addressable cost base for our procurement activities was made up of €2.1 billion of direct costs and €0.5 billion
of indirect costs for the 2018/2019 Financial Year.

(d) Represents expected cost savings related to our other operational initiatives, comprising (i) €28 million of cost savings from
(1) increased productivity, (2) a reduction in direct and indirect personnel expenses and (3) a reduction of scrappage costs by
decreasing the portion of poor quality production to replicate levels achieved at our Korean plant (where such costs are
estimated to be 0.6% of internal sales), particularly at our Middleton plant, (ii) €7 million of cost savings from outsourcing
parts and components and (iii) €15 million of cost savings as a result of streamlining production overhead and assembly
processes.

(e) Represents expected cost savings related to initiatives targeting our general and administrative costs, comprising (i) €20 million
of cost savings from attrition savings and organizational efficiency through a leaner operating model and increased automation,
including within our shared service centers, and the shifting of FTEs to low cost countries and (ii) €16 million of cost savings
from other initiatives.

(2) Pro forma net senior secured indebtedness represents the sum of the pro forma consolidated financial debt of the EUR SSN Issuer that is
secured by a first-priority lien on the SSN Collateral less the pro forma consolidated cash and cash equivalents of the EUR SSN Issuer,
as set forth under “Capitalization.” Pro forma net senior secured indebtedness excludes (i) guarantees of the Senior Notes and of the
Private Senior Notes, (ii) all of our lease liabilities (amounting to €330 million) and (iii) amounts which may be drawn under the
Revolving Credit Facility to fund cash to the Target Group as of the Acquisition Closing Date. See “Use of Proceeds” and
“Capitalization.”

(3) Pro forma net indebtedness represents the pro forma consolidated financial debt of the SUN Issuer, less the pro forma consolidated cash
and cash equivalents of the SUN Issuer, each as set forth under “Capitalization.” Pro forma net indebtedness excludes (i) all of our lease
liabilities (amounting to €330 million) and (ii) amounts which may be drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility to fund cash to the
Target Group as of the Acquisition Closing Date. See “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalization.”.

(4) Pro forma interest expense represents the estimated interest expense of the Group on a pro forma basis for the twelve months ended
March 31, 2020, after giving effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on April 1, 2020, subject to the assumptions set forth
under “Use of Proceeds.” Pro forma interest expense includes commitment fees payable on the Revolving Credit Facility, but excludes
any interest expense in respect of amounts which may be drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility to fund cash to the Target Group as
of the Acquisition Closing Date. See “Capitalization.” Pro forma interest expense is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not
purport to represent what our interest expense would have actually been had the Transactions occurred on April 1, 2019; nor does it
purport to project our interest expense for any future period or our financial position at any future date.

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. Prospective investors in the Notes should carefully_
_consider the risks described below and the other information contained in this offering memorandum before_
_making a decision to invest in the Notes. Any of the following risks, individually or together, could adversely_
_affect our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects, and accordingly the value of the_
_Notes. This section describes the risks and uncertainties that we believe are material, but these risks and_
_uncertainties may not be the only ones that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties, including those of which_
_we are currently unaware or those which we currently deem immaterial, may also result in decreased sales,_
_assets and cash inflows, increased expenses, liabilities or cash outflows or other events that could result in a_
_decline in the value of the Notes, or which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial_
_position, results of operations and prospects. The order in which the risks are presented does not necessarily_
_reflect the likelihood of their occurrence or the magnitude of their potential impact on our business, financial_
_position, results of operations and prospects or on the trading price of the Notes._

_This Offering Memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our_
_actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in those forward-looking statements as a result of_
_various factors, including the risks described below and included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. For_
_more information, see “Forward-Looking Statements.”_

**Risks Relating to Our Business**

**_We operate in a highly competitive industry and are subject to pricing pressure._**

The elevator technology business is a highly competitive sector in a mature industry with a relatively small
number of large, established market participants in each of the New Installation, Service and Modernization
businesses.

In the New Installation business, we mostly compete to sell and install the elevator technology unit, but in some
instances, we also compete with market participants that sell elevators, escalators or components to third-party
distributors who undertake the installation themselves. Our competitors for the New Installation business are
generally consolidated in most of the markets in which we operate, but in certain countries, such as China, there
is more fragmentation. Competitors in this business include global elevator manufacturers, such as KONE, Otis
and Schindler; elevator technology units of large technology multinationals, such as Hitachi and Mitsubishi, both
of which are particularly, but not exclusively, competitive in the Asian markets; and a number of other global,
regional and local manufacturers. Key factors affecting competition in the New Installation business include
initial product price, brand reputation and image, lead time for delivery, cost of ownership, warranty terms,
product safety, technology and innovation, design, quality and performance.

In the Service and Modernization businesses, we compete to provide maintenance and modernization services to
customers irrespective of which company manufactured and installed the original equipment. The postinstallation maintenance services market is very competitive in its own right. Our customers in our New
Installation business are not obliged to engage us for providing post-installation services. Further, most of our
service agreements have a duration of one through five years. Therefore, there is potential for substantial churn in
our customers, among various service providers in the market. Competitors in these businesses include many of
our competitors in the New Installation business who also offer post-installation maintenance and modernization
services, as well as companies focused on providing these services exclusively. This is particularly true in China,
which has a large number of such service-only companies and, as a result, an especially competitive and
fragmented elevator services market. Other areas, such as Europe and North America, have more consolidated
service markets, but nonetheless, with high levels of competition. Key factors affecting competition in the
Service and Modernization businesses include the quality and scope, pricing and other terms of maintenance and
repair services, modernization service and technological support as well as overall customer satisfaction.
Technology has become an increasingly important differentiator, as it enables service providers to plan, execute
and anticipate maintenance and repair needs more precisely. In addition, our Service business and, to a certain
extent, our Modernization business, are dependent on the New Installation business for a material portion of their
new customers and serviced units. This is because most customers or units from the New Installation business
enter into service agreements or convert into service units, as applicable, with us, and may eventually become
customers of the Modernization business. As a result, a decline in customers and installed units in the New
Installation business due to increasing competition would most likely have an adverse impact on the number of
new customers and serviced units for the Service and Modernization businesses.

42


-----

Revenue generated by our Service business exceeded 40% of our total revenue in each of the years ended
September 30, 2017, 2018 and 2019. Loss of customers due to any of the foregoing risks could have a material
adverse effect on our overall results of operation and financial condition.

In all of our businesses, key competitive risks include falling prices due to competition, and a consequent decline
in margins, loss of customers and market share. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, marketing
and operating resources than us, positioning them to potentially maintain or increase their market shares to our
detriment. Companies with larger pools of service and maintenance customers than us benefit from their
incumbent status with those customers and the recurring revenue generated by their service contracts. Our
competitors could adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements, technological developments and
market trends than we do, differentiate themselves more effectively, for example by using technological
innovation to develop a disruptive elevator model, or improve the functionality or performance of their products
and services more quickly or in a more cost-effective manner. Some of the smaller service companies with which
our Service and Modernization businesses compete may be more agile and price-competitive in their local
markets and may as a result, undercut our ability to win new customers and retain the existing ones.

If we are not able to compete effectively, our market share may reduce, there may be further pressure on our
prices and our sales and margins may decline, all of which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, financial position and prospects.

**_Our future business success depends on our ability to respond to evolving market trends with innovative_**
**_products and services on competitive terms._**

The elevator technology market is characterized by a degree of technological change, as well as by product
enhancements and developments, especially in the service and modernization markets. Our future success is
therefore dependent on our ability to anticipate customer needs, develop and market new products and services
and differentiate our product and service offerings from those of our competitors on a timely basis and on
commercially attractive terms. Changes in customer requirements and preferences, new substitute technologies or
evolving industry standards and practices could render our existing products obsolete or less attractive.

In particular, the elevator technology market is currently subject to a number of market trends and technical
developments to which we are required to respond. The trend towards digitalization and other advances has led to
a growth in potential new applications across the elevator and escalator markets, such as so-called smart
elevators and escalators and smart buildings, which use digital technology to enhance efficiency and
performance, leading in turn to higher customer expectations. For example, customers are increasingly
demanding that their elevators deliver reduced travel and waiting time, more customized and convenient travel,
higher safety and quality standards and increased energy efficiency. In order to develop suitable solutions for
such changing customer expectations, we have made in the past, and we expect we will continue to make in the
future, substantial investments into research and development. There can be no assurance, however, that these
efforts will be successful or that potential customers will not prefer solutions offered by our competitors.

Moreover, developing new products and product lines is complex, time-consuming and costly, and involves a
high degree of risk. Our ability to bring new products to the market may require both significant external funding
and reinvestment of profit, including to acquire additional equipment and production capacity. Delays may occur
irrespective of these efforts, resulting in forgone sales revenue and reputational damage. Moreover, market
developments are difficult to predict and our products and technologies may not gain as wide an acceptance as
we expected at the time of our investment. For example, we have recently launched products such as “MAX,”
our cloud- based maintenance tool, and have products in the development pipeline, such as our MULTI elevator
system, in which we have invested considerable time and money. It is not yet clear whether these products will
win widespread customer acceptance or meet our financial expectations in a timely manner, if at all.
Furthermore, the development and marketing of new products can lead to cost overruns in case of inaccurate
planning and budgeting.

If we fail to adapt to prevailing trends and customer requirements in a timely manner or if our products and
services do not gain market acceptance or experience significant cost overruns, our investments in research and
development may not yield expected returns, our market share could reduce and our reputation may be impacted.
Any or all of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition
and prospects.

**_The outbreak of COVID-19 and its global economic impact may materially affect our business and results of_**
**_operations._**

Our business could be adversely affected by the outbreak of contagious diseases, including the recent outbreak of
COVID-19. COVID-19 was first announced in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and since then
has spread to most regions of the world including Europe, Asia, North America and South America. Following
the outbreak of COVID-19 in other countries, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to constitute a
global pandemic. COVID-19 has resulted in lockdowns and various levels of restrictions of movement being
imposed globally, including most countries in which we sell our products and services. The restrictions include
curtailing travel, closure of schools, prohibitions of mass gatherings, mandatory remote working, and in some
countries, the ability to access construction sites and office buildings.

Specifically to our business, all the regions in which we operate our Elevator and Escalator division were
affected by varying degrees. The Access Solutions division has been affected in each of its home solutions and
airport solutions offerings. See “Summary—Recent Developments—Coronavirus (COVID-19).”

Measures and restrictions by governments have caused and may continue to cause the overall macroeconomic
conditions in the regions in which we operate and the end-markets in which we sell our products and services to
deteriorate. Were a recession to occur, we cannot predict the length of such recession or the short- and long-term
impact it may have on the global economy or our business specifically. Any or all such consequences may have
an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.

The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on future
developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak and related travel advisories and restrictions and
the impact of COVID-19 on the overall economy and pace of its overall recovery, all of which are highly
uncertain and cannot be predicted. In addition, COVID-19 may delay or diminish the global trend of increasing
urbanization, which could reduce global demand for new construction and therefore impact our business.
According to IHS, global residential construction spending is expected to decline by 1.5% in 2020, as opposed to
pre-COVID-19 estimates of a growth of 1.9%. Further, global non-residential construction is expected to decline
by 1.7% in 2020, as opposed to pre-COVID-19 estimates of a growth of 1.5%. There are no comparable recent
events that provide us with guidance, and so we cannot assure you that COVID-19 and its consequent economic
effects, or any future outbreak of another virus or other contagious diseases, will not have a material adverse
effect on our business and results of operations. To the extent COVID-19 continues to adversely affect our
business, operations, financial condition and operating results, it may also have the effect of heightening other
risks described in this section, such as those related to indebtedness, our need to generate sufficient cash flows to
service our high level of indebtedness, and our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements
that govern our indebtedness.

**_We may not be able to adjust our personnel and production capacity in line with demand for our products and_**
**_services._**

Demand for our products and services is a function of a wide range of factors, including market cyclicality and
other dynamics, and can be difficult to predict. In particular, the New Installation business is closely linked with
the construction sector and is therefore exposed to significant fluctuations in construction activity levels.
Economic uncertainty, particularly economic downturns, may make it difficult for us to estimate the optimal
level of production capacity, to match our workforce size with conditions in the affected markets and to predict
our future working capital requirements.

From time to time we have experienced, and we may experience in the future, under-utilization of our production
and installation personnel capacity at several of our production facilities as a result of overestimating demand for
our products and services. Capacity under-utilization may result in lower returns on the capital invested in
building such capacity, write-offs on fixed assets and lower product prices, as well as personnel and other costs
associated with maintaining an unnecessarily large workforce, each of which can result in reduced profit
margins. We use measures such as flexible work hours, outsourcing of certain tasks, temporary workers and
production network configuration to calibrate production and personnel capacity. However, these measures may
be inadequate if the decline in demand for our products and services is greater than expected. In addition, we may
not be able to adjust production capacity or personnel in response to economic or market downturns as planned
for political, regulatory or legal reasons, such as employment laws and collective agreements that limit our ability
to adjust the size of our workforce in certain jurisdictions, including in member states of the European Union.
Restructuring measures in connection with capacity adjustments, such as those we have undertaken in our
Middleton, Neuhausen and other manufacturing facilities, could also lead to significant one-off costs.

44


-----

Conversely, if we underestimate demand and have inadequate capacity to meet customer requirements, we may
be compelled to turn away business or miss shipping and project deadlines, resulting in contractual penalties, loss
of customers and market share, loss of revenue and damage to our reputation.

Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial
condition and prospects.

**_Products that do not meet customer specifications or that contain defects or errors could result in significant_**
**_costs for us, including from warranty and product liability claims._**

We are subject to the risk of product defects and defective installation, maintenance or modernization services.
Our New Installation products typically include a contractual one to three year warranty period, but may be
subject to a warranty period of up to according to statutory building laws, depending on the applicable
legislation. The risks are especially present when products are first introduced or when new versions or
enhancements of existing products are released. When the potential for systemic product defects is higher, such a
defect may impact an entire class of products. Product defects or negligence in the provision of services, or
allegations of such, can give rise to contractual warranty, product liability, negligence and other claims. This can
be the case even if the product defect in question is caused by a faulty component or equipment provided by a
third-party supplier. Moreover, we are often contractually required to indemnify customers for damages or losses
resulting from defective products or negligently performed services. Product defects may also necessitate costly
product recalls.

In addition, defects in our products could have severe consequences on end-users and third parties, including
injury and loss of life. In the event of an accident involving our products or services, we could be subject to
claims for negligence, claims in relation to fatal accidents, personal injury, physical damage, product liability and
other lawsuits. Such lawsuits and other similar proceedings can be expensive to defend and may divert the
attention of management and other personnel, regardless of the ultimate outcome. While we have a third-party
product liability insurance program, there can be no assurances that such insurance will provide coverage against
all potential liabilities or that we will be able to maintain such insurance on commercially reasonable terms, if at
all. Similarly, we generally record warranty provisions in our accounts based on past experience and known
claims, but there can be no assurance that such provisions will be adequate for any liability ultimately incurred as
a result of potential product defects or negligence in connection with any of our businesses. In addition, product
defects could require costly product re-designs, recall actions and could damage our reputation, which could in
turn harm our customer relationships and lead to reduced sales. It is also possible that product defects could
result in criminal liability for members of our management regarding their conduct relating to the relevant
product defect, including charges of involuntary homicide or negligent physical injury, which could also damage
our reputation and divert the attention of management from its responsibilities.

Any of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects.

**_Our products and services are subject to a range of different legal and regulatory requirements worldwide,_**
**_compliance with which is costly and burdensome and non-compliance with which may result in significant_**
**_costs and liabilities._**

Our products and services must comply with a broad range of complex legal and regulatory requirements in the
numerous jurisdictions in which we operate. Such laws and regulations include, among others, building codes,
health and safety regulations, industry standards, laws governing public bidding processes, and labor laws
governing local employee and sub-contractor relationships. Such laws and regulations may vary substantially by
jurisdiction, and even within certain jurisdictions. For example, within the United States, each individual state
has adopted a specific building code which references standards for elevators and escalators and which is based,
in most cases, on the International Building Code (“IBC”), in some cases with local variations. Within the EU, an
array of directives and regulations relating to lifts and public safety apply to our business, including technical lift
regulations and safety norms for existing lifts, complemented by laws promulgated by individual member states
such as Germany, France, Italy and Spain. Other key jurisdictions where we do business, including mainland
China, have their own building codes, safety regulations and other laws and regulations which apply to our
products and services. Many jurisdictions regularly revise and update these regulations.

In addition, we are subject to an array of labor laws in the markets where we do business, which are particularly
restrictive in Europe, but can also impact our business in all of our other markets. For example, in South Korea
the government recently passed a directive regulating the degree and conditions under which companies can rely
on local sub-contractors, due to which we will need to employ more service technicians on our rolls to perform

45


-----

services directly and also employ two service technicians for certain services, such as monthly maintenance. The
laws and regulations applicable to our products and services can vary considerably in their content, interpretation
and enforcement from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

As a result, our cost of compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements is considerable, and
such costs may increase further in the future, given the expected stricter enforcement by regulators globally,
particularly in the areas of safety and energy efficiency. Such laws and regulations are also subject to change on
short notice, imposing an additional compliance burden on us. Any changes to the laws and regulations
governing our products and new product approvals could require modifications to our products as well as our
manufacturing equipment, requiring additional labor and material costs in order to ensure compliance. A
violation by us of applicable laws or regulations or the failure to meet legal or regulatory standards could lead to
the imposition of penalties, fines, damages, recalls, restrictions on or prohibitions of business operations and
other adverse consequences. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects.

**_Demand for our products and services depends on economic conditions globally and in our principal regional_**
**_areas of activity._**

Our results of operations depend significantly on economic conditions globally and in our key jurisdictions of
activity, particularly in Europe/Africa, the Americas and Asia/Pacific. We operate in these key jurisdictions
mainly through our Europe/Africa, Americas and Asia/Pacific segments, which contributed 26%, 41% and 28%,
respectively, of our Operating Segments’ total sales in the 2018/2019 Financial Year, with the outstanding
percentage contributed by our remaining segments for which we do not present geography-based sales splits.

Demand for our products and services, especially in the New Installation business, is driven by activity levels
and capital expenditures within the industries we serve, in particular the residential and commercial construction
industry. These industries are highly cyclical and sensitive to changes in global economic conditions, GDP
growth in the relevant markets, inflation, the interest rate environment and conditions in the credit markets. This
cyclicality may result in significant fluctuations in revenue and profitability from period to period and over the
business cycle. Our New Installation business also serves customers in certain specialized industry segments,
mainly industrial applications and large infrastructure projects (such as subway or metro stations), which are also
sensitive to economic conditions. A weak or uncertain economic environment in one of our key regions or
globally may result in fewer construction, industrial and infrastructure projects and lower business volume for
our customers. This, combined with rising costs of capital and low business and consumer confidence, may cause
customers to delay, cancel, or altogether refrain from New Installation of our products and lower our revenues
from the segment. Even if some customers were to proceed with new installations, the decline in activity levels in
a particular region would likely lead to more competition and pricing pressure on our New Installation business,
which could adversely impact our margins.

This risk may be more pronounced in countries like China, where our New Installation business accounts for a
higher proportion of revenue than in other regions, and where demand for new installations has experienced
downturns in the past due to excessive housing supply and restrictive government policies on new construction in
certain metropolitan cities.

Our Service and Modernization businesses are generally impacted to a lesser extent than New Installations by an
economic downturn as customers in most markets are legally obligated to comply with elevator services and
safety requirements. However, our New Installation business is an important source of new customers for the
Service and Modernization businesses. Therefore, a decline in our New Installation business could therefore
eventually lead to fewer new customers in our Service and Modernization businesses, resulting in lower sales as
well as more competition for services and modernization contracts, putting pressure on the prices we charge for
our services and consequently resulting in lower margins. Poor economic conditions could also encourage
customers to delay modernization initiatives.

Volatility in global financial markets, higher interest rates, unemployment rates, trade policy and conflicts,
consumer confidence, lower corporate earnings, tighter credit conditions and public and private debt levels could
impact economic conditions. Furthermore, geopolitical tensions, terrorism, natural catastrophes, pandemics or
other unforeseen events may prompt unexpected, short-term responses from the markets and declines in demand
for our products, leading to lower sales. For example, Europe, our largest geographic market, is facing sharply
slowing economic growth and a number of structural issues, including lingering debt crises and political
instability in certain EU member states and deteriorating confidence in the institutions of the European Union,
each of which could pose a threat to future European integration and cause prolonged economic uncertainty or an
economic downturn. In addition, economic and financial conditions may continue to be adversely affected by the
United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union.

46


-----

Global economic developments are also currently subject to a high degree of uncertainty with respect to the
stability of the global trade and tariff framework. The trade war between the United States and China, withdrawal
from or renegotiation of bi- and multi-lateral trade agreements by the United States, or any countermeasures by
regional or global trading partners, including the European Union, could have a negative impact on the global
economic environment. These could result in lower investment in residential and commercial construction
projects, as well as industrial and infrastructure projects, and a decline in construction levels generally, leading in
turn to less demand for our products. In China, one our most significant individual sales areas, economic growth
decelerated to the slowest annual rate in decades in 2018, as consumer spending and capital investment declined
amid the country’s trade conflict with the United States. The slowing Chinese economy has reportedly adversely
impacted the credit supply, triggering defaults and other payment problems by several construction companies
and leading to suspensions of certain high-rise projects.

Any economic slowdown, downturn or uncertainty, either globally or locally in our markets, could have a
material adverse effect on demand for our products and services. Such events could put pressure on the prices we
charge, resulting in declines in our sales and margins and have a material adverse effect on our business, overall
financial condition and prospects.

**_Our business could be adversely affected by the imposition of protectionist measures, including tariffs and_**
**_other barriers to trade._**

As an international business with production and sales operations across important trading regions, we face
significant risks from a further escalation of tensions between the United States and its trading partners, as well
as a general increase in protectionist measures affecting global trade. Tariffs and other barriers to trade can
adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including by causing less favorable conditions for the import and export
of parts and components and by increasing our cost of production.

Barriers to trade can increase the cost of raw materials, such as steel and aluminum, increasing the cost of parts
and components used to manufacture our products, as well as of spare parts used in our Service and
Modernization businesses. For example, our US operation imports a significant number of components from
external suppliers in China, such as electronic parts and guiderails, which have become more expensive as a
result of the ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China. Trade barriers can also disrupt our
operations within certain countries or markets by delaying imports and exports or by interrupting international
supply lines upon which we rely. Finally, trade barriers can also adversely affect demand for our products
indirectly through the impact they have on our customers’ business growth and investment activities and their
impact on general economic conditions. See “—Demand for our products and services depends on economic
_conditions globally and in our principal regional areas of activity.”_

Any barriers to trade or other protectionist measures may limit our ability to make use of opportunities from
globalized supply chains and other advantages of the global trading system, increase our cost of production or
our products’ prices and could therefore undermine our competitiveness and have an adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

**_We are dependent on third-party suppliers, contractors and distributors._**

We are dependent on third-party suppliers, contractors and sub-contractors and distributors for the timely
delivery of high-quality materials, components and equipment for the manufacture of our products.

_Dependence on suppliers._

If a supplier fails to provide materials, components and equipment as contractually required, or provides materials,
components and equipment that are not of an acceptable quality or which contain defects or errors or which are
delivered on a delayed basis, we may be required to source those supplies or equipment services from alternate
sources. This may result in higher costs, production downtime, inventory backlogs, costly adjustments to or a
re-engineering of our products and delayed completion of project milestones. If we use low quality or defective
components or equipment, we may be exposed to contractual warranty, product liability, negligence and other
claims. Supply and service interruptions can be the result of a number of factors beyond our control, including
product shortages, labor strikes, capacity constraints, regulatory issues or financial distress of the supplier.

The risk of supply interruptions is heightened in instances in which we rely on a small number of suppliers for
the provision of a product or service. In addition to the risk of supply interruptions, the supplier of a key product
or service potentially could exert significant bargaining power over price, quality, warranty or other terms
relating to the product or service. We seek to mitigate such risks through the use of supply agreements containing
provisions designed to avoid such scenarios and aim to have at least two suppliers for important parts and
components. However, such agreements and measures may not always be effective.

47


-----

_Dependence on contractors and sub-contractors._

In addition to external suppliers of goods, we also depend on the services of third-party contractors and
sub-contractors for a significant portion of the work performed, especially in our New Installation business. We
may not always be able to hire qualified contractors and sub-contractors at acceptable prices, especially during
periods of high demand when our competitors may block the installation capacities of our main installation
contractors, rendering them unavailable to us. If we are unable to hire qualified contractors or sub-contractors,
our ability to maintain our customer relationships could be impaired. Moreover, we remain responsible for the
successful completion of our contractors or sub-contractors’ work towards our own contractual partners. As a
result, we may be subject to significant reputational damage, losses or liabilities if contractors or sub-contractors
fail to perform, if serious accidents involving the contractors or sub-contractors occur, or should the contractors
or sub-contractors become insolvent. In addition, a failure by a third-party contractor or sub-contractor or
supplier to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations could negatively impact our business and reputation
and could result in fines, penalties, suspension or, in the case of government contracts, even debarment, which in
turn could adversely impact our reputation and financial results. Although we seek to shift liability for contractor
or sub-contractor underperformance, contract breach or damages to the specific contractor or sub-contractor via
contract, such provisions may not always be effective, in particular where the contractor or sub-contractor in
question is insolvent or otherwise unable to meet its obligations, or in jurisdictions where such contracts may not
always be reliably enforced by local courts.

Many jurisdictions also have laws regulating the treatment of contractors and sub-contractors, with which we
must comply. See “—We are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the protection of the
_environment, health and safety worldwide, compliance with which can be burdensome and non-compliance with_
_which may result in substantial costs.”_

_Dependence on distributors._

We are also dependent on third-party distributors for our sales in a number of jurisdictions. We have a global
sales and services network covering a majority of the world’s countries. More than 60 countries are covered by
our own field operations, whereas approximately 40 countries, most of which are in emerging markets, are served
via distributors. In some countries, where we have our own field operations, we nonetheless use distributors as an
additional sales channel. Our distributing partners sell our products and services either on an exclusive or
non-exclusive basis. Although we believe that our distributors are properly incentivized to sell our products,
there is no assurance that they will not favor a competitor’s products, particularly where we have a non-exclusive
sales relationship with them, or that they will sell our products as effectively as our competitors sell their
products in those markets, or that our distributors will always succeed in meeting our sales targets and other
expectations. If our distributors fail to effectively sell our products, this could have a material adverse effect on
our New Installations sales, and we could lose market share to our competitors in those markets.

Any of the foregoing risks relating to our dependence on third-party suppliers, contractors and distributors could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.

**_We may fail to achieve the targeted benefits from restructuring and operational improvement measures._**

Efficiency improvements and cost savings are crucial for us to maintain our competitiveness and improve our
profitability. In recent years, our most significant operating expenses have been on an upward trend, pressuring
our profit margins. Our future success will therefore depend, in part, on our ability to implement operational
improvement measures. Such measures could seek to simplify our product portfolio, increase manufacturing
efficiency through restructuring production and optimize supply chains. They could also seek to reduce our
SG&A expenses by streamlining management, centralizing administrative costs and improving IT systems. In
developing our financial targets relating to sales growth and profitability, we have made certain assumptions
about the financial impact that these operational improvement measures will have on our future financial results.
However, there can be no assurance that these initiatives will yield the targeted benefits, or that they will not
entail higher implementation costs than expected or take longer to implement than expected.

In addition, the adjustments to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA annualizing the impact of certain cost saving
measures and adding back expected synergies from certain operational improvement initiatives presented in this
offering memorandum should be treated with caution when making an investment decision. The assumptions we
have made with respect to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA that we present in this offering memorandum are based
on our current estimates and they involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause
actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any anticipated future results,
performance or achievements expressed or implied by such adjusted financial information. Our anticipated cost

48


-----

saving and operational run-rate synergies are based upon assumptions about our ability to implement cost saving
measures in a timely fashion and within certain cost parameters. Our ability to achieve planned cost saving and
operational run-rate synergies is dependent upon a significant number of assumptions, some of which may be
beyond our control, including the development of the markets for our products and services, political, legal,
fiscal, market and economic conditions, regulatory developments, and tariff and wage increases. If one or more
of our underlying assumptions regarding these measures proves to have been incorrect, these efforts could lead to
substantially higher costs than planned and we may not be able to realize fully, or realize in the anticipated
timeframe, the expected benefits from our cost saving and operational measures. In addition, cost saving and
operational efficiencies from improved production processes may not be able to be sustained due to changes in
customer needs, changes in regulations, availability and cost of materials or other cost variables.

Our new business initiatives could also result in unintended consequences, such as the loss of key customers and
suppliers and strikes and other industrial actions by our employees, which could undermine the benefits of the
operational improvements by disrupting production and leading to different costs. Operational efficiency
measures generally require a significant amount of management attention and resources, which may disrupt or
otherwise have an adverse effect on our ongoing business operations. These factors may offset the cost savings
we anticipate and which we have included in our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. Consequently, our inability to
realize our anticipated cost savings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operation.

**_We are subject to project management and execution risks in connection with our New Installation business._**

Our installation work may require complex project management and execution by our supervisors, employees
and sub-contractors, in particular to ensure completion deadlines are met and costs are managed to ensure
appropriate margins. Costs and contractual completion dates are based on many assumptions which include, in
particular, the cost and availability of labor, equipment and materials, and can be adversely affected by local
weather conditions, delays in the commencement of construction work, strikes or other work stoppages, quality
problems with products and components, the timely performance of suppliers and sub-contractors or other third
parties and unanticipated technical problems, among other events over which we may have no or only limited
control. We have in the past borne time and cost overruns due to unforeseen reasons, including project-delay
costs not chargeable to customers, and re-work issues and in some cases, suffer consequential contractual
penalties. If we are unable to control these factors in our ongoing or future projects, it could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_Our business depends on the price and availability of high-quality raw materials, parts and components._**

We purchase a broad range of components and parts in connection with our manufacturing operations. These
include electric and electronic components like traction machines and printed circuit board assembly, as well as
mechanical components like guiderails, shaft/cabin doors, speed governors and escalator steps, among others.
These components often contain raw materials such as steel, aluminum and rare earths (which are used in
magnets), and therefore their price and availability is impacted by fluctuations in the underlying raw material
costs. The cost of parts and components represents a significant portion of our total costs.

Prices for raw materials, components and parts are susceptible to fluctuations, driven by global or regional
supply/demand dynamics in commodity and end markets, production capacity constraints of suppliers,
availability of certain materials, transportation costs, infrastructure failures, government regulations and tariffs,
geopolitical events, changes in currency exchange rates, the economic climate and other factors. Price increases
attributable to such price fluctuations, along with increasing transportation costs, can create pressure on our profit
margins. If the prices of these parts and components increase in the future, and we are not able to at least partially
pass such increases on to customers in the form of higher prices or otherwise mitigate costs, this could negatively
affect our profitability. We do not hedge our exposure to raw material price increases.

We are also subject to the risk of supply shortages for key raw materials used in our parts and components. A
shortage of these could arise from increases in demand due to strong economic and market conditions, decreases
in extraction and production due to natural disasters, political instability or unrest or production limits imposed in
extracting and producing countries. For example, China, which is currently the predominant producer of rare
earth elements, has limited the export of such elements in the past and is increasingly using other mechanisms,
such as an export licensing system or the imposition of higher raw material duties, which has caused adverse
price movements in the past and could limit access to such materials. Shortages in the availability of key parts
and components due to shortages in the underlying raw materials may result in production shortfalls that could, if
significant, result in the inability to fulfill customer orders and complete projects, and result in a loss of business

49


-----

volume. Any of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of
operations, financial condition and prospects.

**_Unforeseen business interruptions at production facilities or other operational problems may lead to_**
**_production bottlenecks or project delays._**

Our success depends on the uninterrupted and reliable operation of our manufacturing operations. Unforeseen
disruption of a production facility could be caused by a number of events, including a maintenance outage, power
or equipment failure, fires, floods, earthquakes or other natural disasters, social unrest or terrorist activity, work
stoppages, public health concerns (including pandemics), regulatory measures or other operational problems. For
instance, many of our manufacturing facilities experienced temporary shutdowns due to COVID-19 recently.
Serious construction site accidents, particularly those resulting in fatalities, can lead to production disruptions
and even lengthy work stoppages caused by regulatory or other official interventions.

A prolonged disruption at a manufacturing facility could result in production downtimes or temporary operation
at reduced capacity preventing us from completing production orders in a timely manner, loss of business
volume, and reduced productivity or profitability at a particular production site. Even less severe problems
involving our production facilities, such as missed shipment dates, split shipments, defective software or
materials, or logistics problems, could lead to project delays or other problems in our New Installation business.
It could also result in significant repair costs and, in severe cases, injuries or loss of life that are not or not
completely covered by our insurance coverage.

Any production downtime, stoppage at our facilities or project sites, serious accidents or other operational
problems and delays, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of
operations, financial condition and prospects.

**_We are subject to risks relating to public sector contracts and non-compliance with regulations on public_**
**_procurement._**

We derive a material portion of our revenues from governmental entities, quasi-governmental organizations and
state-owned businesses. Projects involving governments or governmental agencies carry various risks inherent in
the government contracting process. For example, business generated from public or quasi-public entities may be
affected by political and administrative decisions concerning levels of public spending or changes in
governments and their economic policies. Decisions to decrease public spending or changes in priorities or other
unforeseen issues may result in the termination or downscaling of public sector contracts, which could result in a
loss of revenue and limit our recovery of incurred costs, reimbursable expenses and profits on work completed
prior to the termination. Contractual non-compliance, failure to comply with procurement regulations and laws
regarding the protection of classified information, violation of non-discrimination rules or environmental, health
and safety regulations and other improper or illegal activities, may result in various civil and criminal penalties
and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, exclusion from
future tenders, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with the
government. Government contracts are also often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity than other
contracts. Any negative publicity related to such contracts, regardless of the accuracy of such publicity, may
adversely affect our business and reputation. The realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse
effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_We may fail to successfully identify, enter into or integrate acquisitions and/or successfully execute disposals._**

We have made acquisitions and disposals in the past and we anticipate we will enter into such transactions in the
future. For example, in May 2019, we announced the acquisition of Nashville Machine Elevator Co., Inc.,
followed in July by the announcement that we had acquired O’Keefe Elevator Company Inc., both in the United
States. Corporate acquisitions and disposals are associated with significant risks. We may not be able to identify
suitable acquisition candidates in the future. Even if we do identify a suitable acquisition candidate, we may not
be able to finance such acquisition on favorable terms, if at all. Diligence reviews of acquisition targets may not
identify all of the material issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost or potential loss contingencies with
respect to a particular transaction, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an
acquisition target’s previous activities. We may incur unanticipated costs or expenses in connection with such
transactions, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate
facilities, litigation and other liabilities, including related to warranties. We may also encounter difficulties in
integrating acquisitions with our operations, applying our internal controls processes to these acquisitions or in
managing strategic investments. Target companies may be located in countries in which the underlying legal,

50


-----

economic, political and cultural conditions do not correspond to those customary in our key areas of activity or
have other national peculiarities with which we are not familiar. Moreover, any planned acquisition may be
subject to review and approval by the competition and other regulatory authorities of a number of jurisdictions,
which may impede a planned transaction.

We may not realize the targets for growth, economies of scale, cost savings, development, production and
distribution targets, or other strategic goals that we seek from the acquisition to the extent or in the timeframe
anticipated, and the attention of management and other personnel may be diverted for long periods of time.
Moreover, the purchase price may prove to have been too high or unforeseen restructuring or integration
expenses may become necessary. Failure to successfully complete our corporate acquisitions or the acquisition of
equity interests in companies could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and
prospects.

Furthermore, we may make strategic disposals from time to time. Disposals may result in continued financial
involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the
completion of the respective transactions. Under these arrangements, non- performance by those divested
businesses could result in financial obligations for us and could affect our future financial results. In addition, we
could be subject to potential liabilities resulting from contractual warranties and indemnities, as well as
regulatory risks of not being able to obtain required approvals.

The materialization of any of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, financial condition and prospects.

**_We are exposed to foreign exchange translation and transaction risks, which may reduce our operating_**
**_results, and our hedging activities may not be effective._**

Our reporting currency is the euro. However, we conduct our business in a large number of countries across the
globe and in several international currencies. In the years ended September 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, 77% of our
net sales were generated by operating subsidiaries with a functional currency (generally the local currency) other
than the euro. In terms of our results of operations, the US dollar, the Chinese renminbi, the Brazilian real, the
Canadian dollar and the South Korean won are the most important foreign currencies. Any change in exchange
rates between foreign currencies and the euro affects our reported results of operations and assets and liabilities
when the results of those subsidiaries are translated into euro for reporting purposes. In preparing combined and
consolidated financial statements, assets and liabilities of subsidiaries are translated into euro at the foreign
exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Income statements of subsidiaries are translated to euro at the average
exchange rates for the period. Accordingly, fluctuations in the value of other currencies against the euro reduce
or increase these subsidiaries’ contribution to, among other things, our net sales and profit and thus also affect
our statement of financial position.

Among the factors that affect foreign exchange rates are trade balances, short-term interest rates, differences in
relative values of similar assets in different currencies, long-term opportunities for investment and capital
appreciation, and other macroeconomic and political developments, including deliberate manipulation by certain
countries of their currencies. The exchange rates between the foreign currencies and the euro have fluctuated
significantly in recent years and may continue to do so in the future. Unfavorable fluctuations in the values of the
currencies in which our international subsidiaries’ financial statements are prepared against the euro could have a
material negative impact on our future consolidated financial statements.

We are also exposed to transactional risk to the extent our subsidiaries and us execute transactions in a currency
other than our functional currency, which arises mainly when we import components from one jurisdiction,
incurring a cost in that jurisdiction’s currency, and invoice for our products and installation in the local currency.
Our transactional risk exposure is less significant than our translation risk exposure, because we produce and
install our products predominantly in our key markets, which generally has the effect of matching the currencies
of our costs with those of our sales. Nonetheless, adverse exchange rate movements can impact the profitability
of our New Installation business and, to a lesser degree, the Modernization business, to the extent key imported
components become more expensive in our local sales areas.

We generally manage our transactional foreign currency risk related to booked transactions through different
foreign exchange hedging strategies, mainly consisting of derivative foreign exchange instruments and split
currency sales contracts. There can be no assurance that we can always enter into such arrangements on
acceptable terms, that such arrangements will be available at all times when we wish to use them, that the
relevant over-the-counter counterparty will always be able to fulfill our contractual obligations or that these
strategies will be sufficient to effectively mitigate the transactional foreign exchange risks described above. In
addition, we do not hedge our foreign currency translation risk exposure.

51


-----

Our exposure to exchange rate volatility, our unsecured translation risks and a failure to adequately hedge
transactional risks could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects.

**_We are subject to risks related to our international operations._**

We have manufacturing operations, customers, and projects worldwide, including in a number of emerging
markets. As a result, we are subject to various risks inherent in international business operations, including:

- political and economic instability and exposure to potentially undeveloped legal systems;

- unexpected or unfavorable changes in foreign laws, regulatory requirements and related interpretations;

- difficulties in attracting and retaining locally qualified management and employees;

- staffing challenges, including those related to works councils, labor unions and immigration laws;

- exposure to economic sanctions, laws and regulations, trade barriers, local content requirements and import
and export licensing requirements;

- logistical and communications difficulties;

- requirements to expend a portion of funds locally and governmental industrial cooperation requirements,
coups, increased risk of fraud and political corruption, terrorism, or acts of war;

- exposure to local public health issues and the resulting impact on economic conditions;

- the complexity of managing competing and overlapping tax regimes;

- foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and currency controls;

- greater risk of uncontrollable accounts and longer collection cycles;

- the risk of government-sponsored competition; and

- controls on the repatriation of cash.

In particular, we have significant operations in mainland China and derive a significant portion of our revenues
from Chinese customers. As a consequence, we are increasingly subject to economic and political risks in
mainland China, as well as certain Chinese laws and regulations regarding foreign-invested enterprises, including
foreign currency exchange rules. Moreover, as laws and regulations in mainland China are gradually evolving,
there may be uncertainty in their interpretation and enforcement. The administrative and court authorities in
China have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory terms. Thus, it may be more difficult
for us to evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings in China, should they arise, than in other
systems.

Our overall success as a global business depends to a considerable extent on our ability to anticipate and
effectively manage differing legal, political, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions and
unforeseeable developments. The materialization of local business risks or our inability to adapt to changing
conditions in markets outside of our core markets could have significant adverse effects on our business, results
of operations and financial condition.

**_We are subject to risks arising from legal disputes and government proceedings._**

We are, and may in the future become involved in or threatened with, legal proceedings in the ordinary course of
our business, including disputes with suppliers, sub-contractors, customers, employees and investors concerning,
among other things, breaches of contract, product defects and liability, intellectual property, labor and
environmental or shareholder rights issues. Furthermore, we may become subject to proceedings by
governmental authorities in connection with our compliance with laws and regulatory requirements, including in
the areas of antitrust, tax, environmental and safety matters. For example, we have in the past been fined a total
of €319.8 million by the European Commission for violation of EU antitrust rules and currently face private
enforcement claims in relation to our participation in elevator cartels in several EU jurisdictions, the current total
value of the claims being approximately €150 million. See “—We are exposed to legal risks regarding antitrust
_regulation and related enforcement actions and damage claims.” In addition, four fatal accidents in South Korea_
resulting in the deaths of five employees from consortium partners of our South Korean subsidiary have led to
criminal and administrative proceedings for alleged violation of various health and safety-related rules, as well as
construction industry and elevator regulations in connection with the use of sub-contractors. The alleged

52


-----

violations of health and safety and construction industry regulations may result in the imposition of monetary
fines and a suspension of the New Installation business license in South Korea for a period of time ranging from
several months to, in a worst case scenario, a much longer period, depending on the final outcome of the
proceedings. The alleged violations of the elevator regulations could result in monetary fines as well as
suspension of our Service business license in South Korea for at least two years. In addition, we could suffer
reputational damage in South Korea as a consequence of the proceedings. Although we do not anticipate lengthy
suspensions of the New Installation or Service business licenses to be a likely outcome of the proceedings, there
is no guarantee that this will prove to be correct. The outcome of pending or potential future legal or regulatory
proceedings is, as a general matter, difficult to predict. If such proceedings are resolved against us, we may be
subject to civil, criminal or other penalties, as well as damages, as described above, which may exceed any
provisions set aside or any available insurance coverage or be required to change our business practices. Even if
we ultimately prevail in legal and regulatory proceedings, defending such actions can be costly and result in the
diversion of management’s attention away from our business.

Any legal or regulatory proceeding pending or threatened against us could have a material adverse effect on our
reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

**_We are exposed to legal risks regarding antitrust regulation and related enforcement actions and damage_**
**_claims._**

We are subject to antitrust regulation in the European Union and other jurisdictions and therefore face a number
of legal risks in connection with anticompetitive business practices.

A finding of infringement of antitrust regulations can result in: significant fines, based on, among other factors,
the infringing entity’s annual turnover; private enforcement claims by third parties, such as customers and/or
competitors; a requirement to change business practices that may result in reduced revenues and/or margins; and
reputational damage. In addition, antitrust rules and regulations in certain jurisdictions may impose restrictions
on our ability to carry out certain acquisitions, enter into joint ventures, or require forced divestments or the
implementation of other measures.

The elevator technology industry has seen heightened scrutiny by antitrust authorities in recent years and we
have faced, and may in the future face, significant antitrust enforcement actions. In 2007, the European
Commission imposed fines on thyssenkrupp AG, the Target’s holding company, and its affiliates as well as other
global elevator manufacturers for participation in cartels for the installation and maintenance of lifts and
escalators in Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands in violation of EU antitrust rules. The
European Commission decision cited impermissible restrictive business practices, including rigged bids for
procurement contracts, price fixing, allocation of projects among competitors, and the exchange of business
secrets and other confidential information, among other offenses. thyssenkrupp AG and its subsidiaries were
fined €479.7 million in 2007, an amount that was subsequently reduced to €319.8 million. We avoided a fine
from similar investigations by the Austrian Federal Competition Authority by acting as a crown witness. Private
enforcement claims in connection with these matters have been filed both in and out of court against
thyssenkrupp AG and its subsidiaries in a number of jurisdictions, including Belgium, Austria and the
Netherlands. The claimants allege that the cartel led to cartel overcharges and umbrella damages in relation to
sales by third-party competitors not participating in the cartel, the total value of the claims being approximately
€150 million plus interest. Our indemnity under the Share Purchase Agreement for these claims is capped to
€29 million and is only applicable for existing claims. We have set aside provisions for those pending claims
which, in our opinion, will probably lead to cash outflows.

Adverse judgments in these or potential future antitrust matters could result in substantial liability for us, which
could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and reputation.

**_The pricing of cross border transactions is often the subject of negotiation with tax authorities, and any_**
**_adjustments imposed may lead to the greater or double taxation of profits._**

Most national tax authorities follow the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development or United
Nations guidelines when considering the arm’s length nature of cross border pricing of goods and services.
Adjustments made by a national tax authority may not lead to a corresponding adjustment in the other tax
jurisdiction. Also, even where a corresponding tax adjustment is allowed, national tax rates may be different and
may therefore increase our overall burden of taxation. Our cross border trade is increasing and, although we
benchmark our intercompany pricing regularly, the risk of an adverse adjustment will require constant
monitoring, which may require a substantial amount of management resources. Potential discrepancies in the
adjustments made by the tax authorities in certain jurisdictions may result in an increased tax burden on our
Group.

53


-----

**_We may be exposed to transfer price risks in connection with our operating activities._**

We take advantage of our international network and centralize our strategic functions. In particular, we transfer
and provide goods and services among the companies of the Group by adopting a corporate tax transfer frame
model for the billing of intercompany services. There is a risk that tax authorities in individual countries will
assess the relevant transfer prices differently from our tax transfer pricing model and address retroactive tax
claims against one of our companies. While our tax transfer pricing model has been audited by the competent
authorities in certain countries, in others such model is still under discussion with the authorities. A German
Group company had been subject to a tax audit related to transfer pricing issues for the financial years 2010 to
2012. According to the view of the German tax authorities, the transfer prices for supplies of products between
such Group company and foreign Group companies had been determined incorrectly. Consequently, those
transfer prices had been adjusted for the financial years 2010 to 2012. Such adjustment was rolled-over to the
financial years 2013 to 2015. Presumably, such transfer pricing adjustments will also be undertaken in the course
of audits for subsequent financial years. Also in other cases, there can be no assurance that our transfer prices
will be accepted by all the relevant authorities. If they fail to be accepted, this could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the Notes.

**_We are dependent on good relationships with our employees and their trade unions as well as employee_**
**_representative bodies and stakeholders and are party to a number of collective agreements._**

We are dependent on good relationships with our employees, trade unions, employee representative bodies such
as works councils (Betriebsräte) and other stakeholders to successfully operate our business. Personnel expenses
make up a significant portion of our costs and we are obliged to comply with various collective agreements, such
as collective bargaining agreements and works council agreements that are in place with trade unions as well as
works councils and other employee representative bodies. Employees at our German locations and at a number of
foreign subsidiaries have traditionally been heavily unionized and we regularly conduct, or are involved in,
negotiations with the relevant trade unions and employee representative bodies. Any deterioration of these
relationships could adversely impact our business operations.

We have faced strikes and other types of conflicts with trade unions and our employees in the past and may face
them again in the future. In particular, these could come up again when current collective agreements expire or
are to be negotiated. Solidarity strikes at other entities within our Group may also occur. Any such strikes,
conflicts, work stoppages or other industrial actions may disrupt our production and sales activities, damage our
reputation and adversely affect our customer relations, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

Many collective agreements impose obligations and restrictions on us that may adversely affect our flexibility to
undertake adjustments to our workforce, restructurings, reorganizations and similar corporate actions.
Approximately 4,751 of our 52,567 employees as of March 31, 2020 enjoy some form of special protection
against dismissal based on contractual commitments which are contained in, inter alia, collective agreements (in
particular, the “Future Elevator” agreement concluded in March 2020), which means that ordinary dismissals of
these employees are in general not possible or, depending on the scope of the additional protection, are subject to
special requirements. These commitments are over and above the requirements under applicable labor laws. For
example, in March 2020, thyssenkrupp Elevator concluded a collective bargaining agreement “Future Elevator”
with German IG Metall in connection with the Acquisition. The “Future Elevator” collective bargaining
agreement excludes forced redundancies (Ausschluss betriebsbedingter Beendigungskündigungen) and site
guarantees (Standortsicherungszusagen) for the German production and essential service sites and is valid until
March 31, 2027. Further, we also have in place a collective agreement including a site guarantee
(Standortsicherungszusage) for the site in Neuhausen (Germany) until September 30, 2022. In addition, we have
in place collective agreements excluding ordinary dismissals (Beschäftigungssicherung) for Neuhausen until
September 30, 2022 and for 390 employees of the German field organization until September 30, 2026, with an
option to terminate the agreement on September 30, 2022.

Any restructuring or reorganizational measures, including the commercial operations cost savings measures that
we succeed in carrying out as part of the Transformation Program, may strain relations with employees and their
representatives. This may make it more difficult for us to subsequently negotiate, renew or extend collective
agreements in a favorable and timely manner. We may also become subject to new collective agreements, which
may increase our operating costs. In addition, our competitors may obtain competitive advantages compared to
us, if they succeed in negotiating collective wage agreements or other collective agreements on more favorable
terms and conditions. Any failure to negotiate wages and other key employment conditions that are reasonable
and fair from our perspective could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations or prospects.

**_Our success depends substantially on our ability to attract, hire, train and retain experienced management and_**
**_personnel._**

Our management team has substantial expertise and industry experience and the loss of key members of
management could adversely affect our ability to implement our strategic objectives. Further, we are also
dependent on personnel that are highly skilled and qualified in scientific, mechanical and technical fields. In
some jurisdictions, the technicians servicing our products are required by local regulations to have special
qualifications, limiting the supply of such technicians. In the United States, a shortage in qualified technicians
has already led to hiring constraints and in the Asia/Pacific market, technicians typically need to receive
extensive in-house training before they can start servicing our products.

Our success in attracting and retaining such personnel depends on a variety of factors, including the supply of
qualified candidates in the relevant market, as well as our compensation and benefit programs, work
environment, career development opportunities, commitment to diversity and public image. These factors may
pose greater risks in connection with the Reorganization and the Acquisition. Competition for qualified personnel
is increasing. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining experienced
management and key technical personnel and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

**_The value of goodwill, brand names or other intangible assets reported in our financial statements may need_**
**_to be partially or fully impaired as a result of revaluations._**

As of March 31, 2020, our carrying amount of intangible assets, including goodwill, recorded on our
consolidated statements of financial position was €1,922 million. Under IFRS, we are required to annually test
our recorded goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and to assess the carrying values of other intangible
assets when impairment indicators exist. Because of such tests, we could be required to recognize impairment
losses in our income statement, if the carrying value is in excess of the fair value or value in use. Factors that
could trigger an impairment of such assets include the underperformance of our business relative to projected
future operating results, negative industry developments or economic trends, including changes in borrowing
rates or weighted average cost of capital, applicable tax rates or changes in working capital. Should we have to
book any impairment losses, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

**_We have a substantial pension and other similar employee benefits-related obligations and are subject to risks_**
**_related to the development of these obligations and to funding requirements of our pension and other post-_**
**_employment benefit plans._**

We maintain various pension plans providing for company pension and retirement benefits, including defined
benefit pension plans, and have other similar plans providing for long-term employee related benefits, mainly in
our subsidiaries in Germany, the United States, France, South Korea, the United Kingdom and Switzerland. As of
March 31, 2020, our accrued pension obligations amounted to €319 million.

The valuation and development of the defined benefit obligation under these plans depends, among other factors,
upon agreed contributions rates, future asset performance, longevity and the actuarial profile of the plan
participants, level of interest rates used to calculate future liabilities, actuarial assumptions and experience,
effectiveness of amendments made to the benefit plans and government regulations and potential court rulings in
relation to the plan administration and the calculation. Depending on these variables, future cash funding
requirements for our pension plans and other long-term employee related benefit plans could be significantly
higher than the amounts estimated as of March 31, 2020, which could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations, financial condition or prospects.

If the market value of the plan assets decreases, we may also have to substantially increase our pension
provisions. For example, fluctuations in currency, interest rates, actuarial assumptions and changes in the
valuation of any funding assets may adversely affect the net liabilities for pension plans and similar plans
providing for long-term employee related benefits or, in the case of multi-employer plans like the National
Elevator Industry Pension Plan, the failure of any of the key contributing employers to make adequate
contributions may adversely affect the value of the plan assets. In such event, we may have to cover the shortfall
of funding assets or face significant additional funding obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on
our net assets, financial position and results of operations.

Any significant increase in the present value of our pension and other obligations related to employee benefits
and/or significant decrease in the fair value of the plan assets for a funding of the obligations, could have a
material adverse effect on our net assets, financial position and results of operations.

**_Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient and insurance premiums may increase._**

We maintain insurance coverage in relation to a number of risks associated with our business activities, including
third-party (product) liability, property damage and business interruption, environmental damage, directors and
officers liability, and transport and vehicle insurance. These insurance policies may not cover all losses or
damages resulting from the materialization of any of the risks we are subject to. There can moreover be no
assurance that our insurance providers will continue to grant coverage on commercially acceptable terms or at
all. In addition, there are risks left intentionally uninsured (such as, but not limited to, customer or supplier
insolvency, industrial disputes or specific natural hazards), and we therefore have no insurance against these
events. Further, agreed limits and other restrictions (for example, exclusions) within the insurance coverage may
prove to be too low or inadequate for compensating potential damages or losses, ultimately resulting in a gap in
the insurance coverage. If we sustain damages for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage, or if we
have to pay higher insurance premiums or encounters restrictions on insurance coverage, this may have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and prospects.

**_Our operations, products, systems and services rely on complex information technology systems and networks_**
**_that are subject to the risk of disruption and security breaches._**

We heavily rely on IT systems and networks to support research, procurement, manufacturing, sales, logistics,
business and other processes. In addition, our products, services and systems contain increasingly complex IT.
The consistent, efficient and secure operation of IT is therefore critical to the successful performance of our
operations and the products, services and systems we sell.

Despite IT maintenance and security measures, our IT systems and networks are exposed to the risk of
malfunctions and interruptions from a variety of sources, including equipment damage, deficient database design,
power outages, computer viruses and a range of other hardware, software and network problems. We have
experienced temporary outages in our IT systems in the past. The occurrence of any of these events could
compromise the operational integrity of these systems and networks. In the case of technology included in our
products, services and systems, malfunctions and disruptions could impact their functionality and jeopardize the
safety of users such as elevator passengers. The risk in this respect is heightened as we increasingly sell digitally
enhanced products, systems and services.

In addition, our IT systems have in the past, been the target of cyber-attacks. For instance, in 2016, cyberattackers gained access to our IT systems, following which we undertook a complex remediation project to
improve our systems. Further, in November 2018, a data center in Spain, of which we were a customer, was
subject to a cyber-attack, leading to a shutdown of the center’s Internet connection over a weekend. We
implement mitigation measures from time to time, as we identify new threats and risks. We cannot assure you
that such measures will be effective or that breaches or other cyber-attacks, including industrial espionage or
ransomware attacks will not occur in the future. Failure to effectively prevent, detect and remediate security
breaches, including attacks on our IT infrastructure by hackers, viruses, employee error or misconduct, or other
disruptions could seriously harm our operations and the operations of our customers. Such breaches may result,
among other things, in unauthorized access to trade secrets, confidential business information and personal
information, data losses, business interruptions, non-compliance with legal requirements, legal claims or
proceedings, deterioration in customer relationships and reputational harm. Our shift to using cloud-based
maintenance tools in our Service business could amplify the risk of such breaches, since providers of cloud-based
products and services have been and are expected to continue to be targeted, and providers of remote
connectivity services may be particularly attractive to attackers.

Any disruptions of our IT systems, including as a result of cyber-attacks and industrial espionage, may disrupt
operations, result in legal liability or reduce the competitive advantage we seek to derive from our investment in
advanced technologies. The materialization of any of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

**_We are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, health and safety_**
**_worldwide, compliance with which can be burdensome and non-compliance with which may result in_**
**_substantial costs._**

Our operations must comply with a broad range of regulatory requirements relating to the protection of health
and safety and the environment. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial costs in complying
with these laws and regulations.

Our operations involve a number of occupational health and safety risks. For example, our employees and
sub-contractors who install or maintain our elevator technology products in the field, where they sometimes work

56


-----

at significant heights or at hazardous construction sites, have in the past experienced, and may in the future
experience, injuries and fatalities. We continuously monitor our health and safety record and continue to
implement safety and health measures to comply with applicable health and safety regulations. Notwithstanding
the preventive measures that we have already taken, or may take in the future, there can be no assurance that such
measures will be effective in reducing the number of incidents, and any such incidents may result in disruption to
our New Installation, Service and Modernization businesses, as well as legal and regulatory consequences and
reputational damage. For example, see “Business—Legal Proceedings—Criminal and administrative proceedings
_against thyssenkrupp Elevator Korea Ltd.”._

In the area of environmental regulation, our operations are required to comply with laws and regulations relating
to air, water and noise pollution, laws regulating greenhouse gas emissions, toxic and other chemicals and
materials, waste treatment and disposal methods, and the energy efficiency of production processes, among other
things, in various jurisdictions in which we operate. We are also subject to periodic monitoring by environmental
protection authorities in various jurisdictions. Any failure on our part to comply with any present or future
environmental regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us, suspension
of production or a loss of license to operate certain facilities.

In addition, customers increasingly scrutinize the labor and environmental standards of industrial companies,
particularly in emerging markets. Additional, more stringent social responsibility and anti-discrimination laws,
regulations and practices may be adopted in the future, which may result in an increase in our cost of compliance.
In addition, if we fail to comply with such laws, regulations and practices, we may be subject to fines, penalties,
legal judgments, customer boycotts or other measures, which may adversely affect our reputation, operating
results and financial condition. A finding of non-compliance, or the perception that we have not responded
appropriately to growing consumer concern for issues relating to social responsibility, whether or not we are
legally required to do so, may adversely affect our business and reputation.

If any of the above risks materialize, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, financial condition and prospects.

**_Our operations are subject to sanctions, anti-corruption and money-laundering laws and regulations._**

In connection with our worldwide business operations, we must comply with a broad range of legal and
regulatory requirements relating to export controls, economic sanctions, anti-bribery and corruption laws, and
anti-money laundering laws.

Our entities and personnel are subject to various economic sanctions, including economic sanctions administered
by the United Nations, the EU and the United States (including U.S. sanctions administered by OFAC). These
economic sanctions restrict our ability to engage in business dealings with certain countries and persons.
Currently, we have direct and indirect business activities in Russia and Myanmar and indirect business activities
in Iraq, Belarus, Ivory Coast, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Lebanon, Ukraine, Venezuela and Zimbabwe.
All of these countries are subject, to varying degrees, to economic sanctions. However, we conduct restricted
party screening of both direct and indirect business counterparties and, insofar as we are aware, have not engaged
in any business with any persons targeted by list-based sanctions administered by the United Nations, the
European Union, or the United States.

We have not engaged in any new direct or indirect business dealings with Iran or Libya since 2018 and 2019,
respectively. We are still subject to certain warranty liabilities via our former distributors stemming from
historical business in these countries. Furthermore, as of March 2020, we have stopped all new business dealings
with Cuba and Sudan, although we are still subject to certain warranty liabilities via our former distributors
stemming from historical business in these countries.

Our entities and personnel are also subject to various anti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act of 1977 and the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010. In addition, our entities and personnel are
subject to anti-money-laundering laws and regulations, including the general, non-regulated sector provisions of
the EU’s 5th Money-Laundering Directive, which came into force in 2018.

Some of the countries in which we operate and make sales are perceived to have higher levels of corruption. Our
geographical diversification (including in emerging markets), joint ventures, other business relationships, and
employment of local agents, dealers and distributors in the countries where we operate increases our risk of
violating applicable anti-corruption laws, economic sanctions, and anti-money laundering laws. Violation of such
laws and regulations can be punishable by criminal penalties, civil fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions,
asset seizures, debarment from government contracts (and termination of existing contracts), and revocations or
restrictions of licenses. In addition, violations of these laws could impact our reputation, and, consequently, on
our ability to win future business and maintain long-term commercial relationships with our customers.

57


-----

Economic sanctions, anti-corruption laws, and anti-money-laundering laws change over time. It is difficult for us
to predict how these laws will change in the future or impact our business.

While we have adopted and continuously review compliance policies and procedures reasonably designed to
ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including applicable export controls, economic
sanctions, anti-corruption laws, and anti-money laundering laws, there can be no assurance that these policies and
procedures will be followed at all times or that our internal controls will effectively detect and prevent all
violations of applicable law by our employees, consultants, agents or partners.

If we do not adequately manage the above risks, we could be subject to some or all of the consequences
described above, which, in turn, could adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, and future
prospects.

**_Our internal controls, procedures, compliance systems and risk management systems may prove to be_**
**_inadequate to prevent and discover previous or future breaches of laws and regulations and generally to_**
**_manage risks._**

Members of our governing bodies, employees, authorized representatives or agents may intentionally or
unintentionally violate applicable laws and internal standards and procedures, in particular in relation to anticorruption, money-laundering, antitrust and sanctions compliance as well as compliance with laws and
regulations regarding sales practices, products and services, environment, finance, employment and general
corporate and criminal law. However, there can be no certainty that our internal controls, procedures, compliance
systems and risk management systems will be able to identify such violations, ensure that they are reported in a
timely manner, evaluate them correctly or take the appropriate countermeasures, and that they will be adequate
for an enterprise of our scale and complexity. For instance, issues regarding local book keeping and financial
reporting processes led to qualified, adverse or disclaimer of opinions on the financial information of certain
entities of the Elevator Technology Business’s Operating Unit Spanish Latin America in several instances as of
September 30, 2018 and 2017 and for the financial years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017. It was
revealed that certain individuals in the local accounting and reporting teams of the Elevator Technology
Business’s Operating Unit Spanish Latin America requested and made adjustments based on best estimates to
figures representing cash and cash equivalents as well as other balance sheet positions, profit and loss positions
and Group KPIs, such as EBIT and business cash flow without documentation properly justifying those
adjustments. It was determined that the adjustments were made at least partially as a result of the long working
hours and high turnover rate in the relevant accounting and controlling departments, the complexity within local
reporting systems and processes and a lack of formal control and procedures in the relevant departments. As a
result, our management has made certain adjustments to the financial information for the periods affected based
on their best estimates. For more information and a list of these adjustments, see Note 1 of the Audited
Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and “Presentation
_of Financial Information—Historical Financial Information.” However, the independent auditor’s report on the_
Audited Combined Financial Statements is qualified since the auditor was not able to obtain sufficient
information and evidence required to assess the existence, completeness, valuation and cut-off of the assets and
liabilities of these entities as of September 30, 2018 and 2017 as well as the income and expense for the financial
years ended September 30, 2019, 2018, 2017 of these entities. In addition, in the Unaudited Interim Consolidated
Financial Statements, the issues relating to the Elevator Technology Business’s Operating Unit Spanish Latin
America described above still remained for the six-month period ended March 31, 2019 (see Note 1 of the other
explanatory notes of the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements).

There can further be no certainty that any countermeasures implemented by us in respect of the above or any
such issues in the future will be appropriate to reduce the corresponding business risks effectively or that as of
yet undetected breaches of law or regulations have not occurred in the past, and that their discovery would not
result in significant liability or reputational damage for us.

Moreover, in light of continuously evolving legal and regulatory requirements, and internal developments such as
corporate reorganizations, there can be no certainty that our risk management systems, internal controls and
compliance systems and related governance structures will adequately identify and address all relevant
requirements.

Any failure to effectively prevent, identify or address violations of our legal obligations as a result of inadequate
internal controls, procedures, compliance systems and risk management systems could result in penalties and
other sanctions, liabilities, the assertion of damages claims by third parties, and reputational damage, each of
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition or prospects.

**_We may not adequately protect our intellectual property and know-how or may be liable for the infringement_**
**_of third-party intellectual property._**

Our success in maintaining our competitive position depends, to a significant extent, on our ability to obtain and
enforce intellectual property rights worldwide. We seek to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights
through a combination of patents, registered designs, trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights and similar
protections. With respect to proprietary know-how that is not patentable and production processes for which
patents are difficult to enforce, we rely on trade secret protections and confidentiality agreements to safeguard
our interests.

Steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information may not be adequate to prevent
misappropriation of our technology as the existence of laws or contracts prohibiting such actions may not always
serve as sufficient deterrents. Policing the unauthorized use of our intellectual property may be expensive and
time-consuming. Our intellectual property rights may be, and have in certain instances been, challenged, and we
may not be able to secure such rights in the future. In addition, the laws of certain countries may not protect our
proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the European Union or the United States. Consequently, third
parties, including our competitors, may be able to use the technology behind our products and processes without
a license. The undue exploitation of our intellectual property or know-how by third parties may reduce or
eliminate our competitive advantage derived from our own technology, limiting our ability to develop further
innovative technologies as well as our capacity to compete in the markets where we operate and to attract new
customers.

We may also infringe patents, trademarks or other third-party rights and is currently subject to certain
infringement claims from third parties. If we are found to have infringed third-party intellectual property rights,
we may have to pay royalties, damages, modify manufacturing processes, or redesign products or may be barred
from marketing certain products. Should we have to redesign products or become barred from marketing certain
products, we could face significant production and delivery delays or be unable to sell certain products
altogether, both of which could result in lost business volume. The defense of intellectual property suits, patent
opposition proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings may moreover be both costly and timeconsuming. Finally, we may not be able to obtain the licenses to use certain third-party intellectual property that
we may require on reasonable terms in the future. The materialization of any of these risks could lead to delivery
and production restrictions or interruptions and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, financial condition and prospects.

**_We are exposed to regulatory and legal risks relating to data protection._**

Our business operations generate and store significant volumes of personal and sensitive business information,
including personally identifiable information of customers, employees, partners and suppliers. The volume and
complexity of electronically processed data, moreover, continues to increase as we increasingly sell data-driven
service solutions, which involve the transfer and analysis of data. We are subject to privacy and information
security regulations with respect to, among other things, the use and disclosure of personal data, and the
confidentiality, integrity and availability of such information. In particular, we are subject to the stringent
requirements of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), violation of which carries fines of up to
4% of our global turnover. In addition, the GDPR grants individual data subjects the right to claim damages for
violations of their rights under the GDPR. We cannot ensure that the confidentiality of such data and information
will not be breached as a result of cybersecurity attacks or otherwise, or that doubts may arise regarding the
security of the data and information collected and managed by us.

If we fail to adequately safeguard confidential personal or other sensitive data, we could be subject to damages,
significant fines, penalties and other liabilities and the loss of customers and reputation, which could in turn have
a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

**_We are subject to complex tax laws, and changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax position could adversely_**
**_affect our results of operations and financial condition._**

Changes in tax laws could adversely affect our tax positions, including our effective tax rate or tax payments. We
often rely on generally available interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations. We cannot be certain that
the relevant tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretation of these laws. If our tax positions are
challenged by relevant tax authorities, the imposition of additional taxes could require us to pay taxes that we
currently do not collect or pay or increase the costs of our services to track and collect such taxes, which could
increase our costs of operations and have a negative effect on our business, financial condition, operating results
and cash flows.

59


-----

**_We are exposed to tax risks, which could arise in particular as a result of tax audits or past measures._**

Due to the global nature of our business, we are subject to income and other taxes in multiple jurisdictions.
Significant judgement and estimation are required in determining our calculation and provision for income, sales,
value-add and other taxes, including withholding taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are various
transactions, including, for example, intercompany transactions based on cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing and
transactions with specific documentation requirements, for all of which the ultimate tax assessment or the timing
of the tax effect is uncertain. We are regularly audited by tax authorities, and our tax calculations and our
interpretation of laws are reviewed by tax authorities which may disagree with our tax estimates or judgements.
Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of any such tax audits or reviews
could differ from our tax provisions and accruals and any additional tax liabilities resulting from such final
determination or any interest or any penalties or any regulatory, administrative or other sanctions relating thereto
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or reputation.

While we attempt to assess in advance the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these proceedings
or claims it is difficult to predict final outcomes with any degree of certainty. The final determination of any tax
investigation, tax audit, tax review, tax litigation, and appeal of a tax authority’s decision or similar proceedings
may differ materially from our estimate or which is reflected in our financial statements. An adverse outcome
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and result of operations. In addition,
changes in tax legislation or guidance could result in additional taxes and/or affect our tax rate, the carrying value
of deferred tax assets or our deferred tax liabilities. Any tax audit, tax proceeding or changes in tax legislation or
guidance could, as a result of the realization of any of the above risks, have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

In addition, certain entities of our Group were in the past or are currently part of fiscal unities, tax groups and
other tax consolidation schemes. We cannot ensure that these entities will not be held liable for unpaid taxes of
the members of such tax consolidation schemes (including members outside of our Group) under statutory law or
the contracts which formed or form the basis for the tax consolidation schemes. Furthermore, should such tax
consolidation schemes not be accepted by the tax authorities and/or a tax court, taxes, interest and penalties may
be imposed against entities of our Group. Such liabilities may be substantial and could have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations, financial condition and reputation.

However, pursuant to the provisions of the Share Purchase Agreement, the Seller would be required to bear
certain taxes resulting from prior tax periods up to an agreed cap. Such indemnity is subject to certain exclusions
and limitations. Should such exclusions or limitations be applicable or should the tax liability in question exceed
the cap, or should the Seller not have sufficient funds to settle its indemnification obligation vis-à-vis the Target,
such liability would have to be borne by the Group, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations and prospects.

**Risks Relating to the Transactions**

**_The Acquisition is subject to certain conditions and risks and, if it is not consummated, the Issuers will redeem_**
**_the Notes at 100% of the issue price, plus accrued and unpaid interest._**

On February 26/27, 2020, Bidco entered into the Share Purchase Agreement to acquire, directly or indirectly,
from the Seller all of the issued and outstanding share capital of the Target. The Acquisition is subject to the
satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including, customary antitrust and regulatory approvals and the
performance of certain closing actions. Pending the consummation of the Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers will
deposit the gross proceeds from the Offering into the Escrow Accounts on the Issue Date. The release of the
Escrowed Property is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including that the funds required to pay the
consideration for the Acquisition will be applied promptly (and in any event within two business days). As of the
date of the offering memorandum, we do not yet know whether the Acquisition will be successful.

If the conditions precedent to the Acquisition are not satisfied or waived, as applicable, by the Escrow Longstop
Date, then the Acquisition will not be consummated. If the conditions to the release of the Escrowed Property, as
more fully described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
_Redemption” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” have_
not been satisfied on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the
Notes will be subject to a Special Mandatory Redemption as described in “Description of Senior Secured Notes—
_Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Escrow of_
_Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” and you may not obtain the return you expect to receive on the_
Notes.

60


-----

**_If the conditions precedent to the release of the Escrowed Property are not satisfied, the Issuers will be_**
**_required to redeem the Notes, but the Escrow Accounts may not have sufficient funds to cover such_**
**_redemption without relying on the Escrow Equity Commitment._**

The Escrowed Property will be limited initially to the gross proceeds of the Offering and will not be sufficient to
pay the Special Mandatory Redemption Price, which is equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price of the Notes,
plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory
Redemption Date. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
_Redemption” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” In_
the event that the Special Mandatory Redemption Price payable upon such Special Mandatory Redemption
exceeds the amount of the Escrowed Property, the SUN Issuer, in the case of the Senior Secured Notes, and
Vertical Topco III, in the case of the Senior Notes, will be required to fund the relevant Issuer with an amount
sufficient to cover the difference between the Special Mandatory Redemption Price and the amount of the
Escrowed Property, including accrued interest and additional amounts (if any) due with respect to the Notes from
the Issue Date to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date and any negative interest which has accrued on the
Escrow Accounts, pursuant to the Escrow Equity Commitment.

Holders of the Notes will not have any direct right to enforce the Escrow Equity Commitment, and must rely on
the Issuers’ respective rights to enforcement under the Escrow Equity Commitment. There can be no assurance
that the relevant entities providing such commitment will have sufficient funds to make this payment, and the
Issuers may not have access to the funds necessary to allow them to pay the full amount of the required
redemption price in the event of a Special Mandatory Redemption.

Your decision to invest in the Notes is made at the time of purchase. Changes in the business or financial position
of the Target and its subsidiaries, or the terms of the Acquisition, between the Issue Date and the Escrow Release
Date, may have an impact on our creditworthiness, and you will not be able to rescind your decision to invest in
the Notes as a result thereof.

**_The Issuers do not currently control the Target and will not control the Target until the Acquisition Closing_**
**_Date._**

As of the date of this offering memorandum, the Issuers do not, directly or indirectly, hold any issued and
outstanding common shares of the Target. As a result, the Issuers’ ability to influence the Target’s management
is limited. In particular:

- The Target’s Management Board may not operate the business of the Target until the Acquisition Closing
Date in the same way that the Issuers and the Sponsors would.

- Much of the information contained in this offering memorandum relating to the Target had to be derived
from public sources and, in the case of certain additional information relating to the Target, has been
provided to the Issuers by the Target, and the Issuers have relied on such information that is publicly
available or was supplied to them by the Target in their preparation of this offering memorandum.

- The Acquisition has required, and will likely continue to require, substantial time and focus from the
Target’s management, which could adversely affect their ability to operate the Target’s business. Likewise,
employees may be uncomfortable with the Acquisition.

- In addition, the Target’s Management Board is required to manage the business of the Target under its own
responsibility and in a manner that is in the best interest of the Target.

- Prior to the Acquisition Closing Date and until the change of the Target’s legal form into a Gesellschaft mit
_beschränkter Haftung, the Issuers cannot assure you that the Target will fully comply with the covenants_
described in “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” and “Description of the Senior Notes” to be included
in the Indentures, due to statutory limitations on the influence of shareholders on a public German stock
corporation. As such, we cannot assure you that, prior to such date and such change in legal form, the Target
and its subsidiaries will not take any action that would otherwise have been prohibited by the Indentures had
those covenants been applicable.

We cannot assure you that the Acquisition will be consummated given it is dependent on a number of closing
conditions, including receipt of antitrust and regulatory approvals. If we are not able to satisfy or waive these
conditions, as applicable, the Acquisition Closing Date will not occur and the Acquisition will not be
consummated.

Any of the risks associated with the Issuers’ lack of control over the Target and its subsidiaries until the
occurrence of the Acquisition Closing Date and the change of the Target’s legal form could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

**_The Sponsors’ opportunity to conduct due diligence with respect to the Target was limited, and their due_**
**_diligence may not have revealed all facts that may be relevant in connection with the Acquisition._**

Before making investments, the Sponsors conduct due diligence that they deem reasonable and appropriate based
on the facts and circumstances applicable to each investment. The objective of the due diligence process is to
identify attractive investment opportunities based on the facts and circumstances of an investment, to identify
possible risks associated with that investment and to prepare a framework that may be used from the date of an
acquisition to drive operational achievement and value creation. When conducting due diligence, the Sponsors
typically evaluate a number of important business, financial, tax, accounting, environmental and legal issues in
determining whether or not to proceed with an investment. Outside consultants, legal advisors, accountants and
investment banks are involved in the due diligence process in varying degrees depending on the type of
investment. Nevertheless, when conducting due diligence and making an assessment regarding an investment, the
Sponsors rely on resources available to them, including information provided by the target of the investment and,
in some circumstances, third party investigations.

Instances of bribery, fraud, accounting irregularities, contingent liabilities and other improper, illegal or corrupt
practices can be difficult to detect, and fraud and other deceptive practices can be widespread in certain
jurisdictions.

There may be liabilities that the Sponsors failed or were unable to discover in the course of performing due
diligence investigations into the Target and its subsidiaries in connection with the Acquisition. Following the
Acquisition, we may learn of additional information about the Target and/or any of its subsidiaries that adversely
affect us, such as unknown or contingent liabilities and issues relating to compliance with applicable laws. Any
such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
position and results of operations.

We cannot be certain that the Sponsors’ due diligence investigation has revealed or highlighted all relevant facts
(including fraud, bribery and other illegal activities and contingent liabilities) that may be necessary or helpful in
evaluating the merits of investing in the Target. We also cannot be certain that the Sponsors’ due diligence
investigations will result in the investment in the Target being successful or that the actual financial performance
of such investment will not fall short of the financial projections the Sponsors used when evaluating that
investment.

**_The Acquisition will entitle the Group’s customers and certain other business partners of the Target Group to_**
**_terminate their agreements as a result of change of control provisions._**

The Acquisition will constitute a change of control under certain agreements entered into by the Group and its
subsidiaries. For example, the Issuers have identified change of control provisions in certain customer and
supplier as well as local facility and guarantee agreements. These counterparties will be entitled to terminate their
agreements with us. Some of these counterparties may exercise their termination rights, which could have an
adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

**_The Target’s corporate structure has undergone substantial organizational changes in the context of the_**
**_carve-out and separation from the thyssenkrupp Group, making it very challenging to transparently assess_**
**_past and future Group performance and legal risks._**

The Target’s corporate structure has changed substantially in recent periods in the context of the separation from
the thyssenkrupp Group and may change further, following the Acquisition Closing Date. The operating elevator
companies were held by different companies of the thyssenkrupp Group. Substantial parts of the elevator
business were bundled under thyssenkrupp Elevator Innovation which directly or indirectly held all German
elevator companies, as well as certain foreign elevator companies and performed holding functions for the
Elevator Technology Business. The remaining foreign elevator companies not bundled under thyssenkrupp
Elevator Innovation were held by various foreign companies of the thyssenkrupp Group. To achieve a complete
legal separation of all elevator companies from the other parts of the remaining thyssenkrupp Group and enable
the Acquisition, various measures and share transfers were implemented to reorganize the thyssenkrupp Group
and to bundle all elevator companies under the Target.

As a consequence, past events that are described in the Offering Memorandum as having occurred with respect to
the Group reflect events that occurred before the Target existed as a stand-alone business, and may not be
indicative of events that will occur following the Acquisition, when the Target operates a stand-alone business. It
is therefore difficult to assess the applicability or magnitude of risks disclosed in the Offering Memorandum
given that such risks are based on the performance of the various operating elevator companies when they were

62


-----

operating as part of the thyssenkrupp Group rather than as part of a separate, stand-alone legal or reporting entity.
Similarly, it is difficult to predict our future performance following the Acquisition, given that the historical
financial information for the Elevator Technology Business as presented in this offering memorandum reflects
periods that have occurred prior to the Target’s separation from the thyssenkrupp Group.

The measures and share transfers implemented to reorganize the thyssenkrupp Group and to bundle all elevator
companies under the Target may also have tax effects on the Target and the elevator companies. Given the
substantial value of the Target and the elevator companies and the complexity of the measures taken, taxes
relating to those measures could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of
operations.

**_The Audited Combined Financial Statements are based on management judgements and a series of_**
**_assumptions and estimates that may prove inaccurate and not necessarily representative of the results the_**
**_Target would have achieved as a stand-alone company._**

The Elevator Technology Business did not exist as a separate group prior to December 31, 2019. It formed part
of a larger group of companies controlled by thyssenkrupp AG and was reported as a segment within the
consolidated financial statements of thyssenkrupp AG. In order to facilitate the Acquisition, the Reorganization
was completed on December 31, 2019. Consequently, the Audited Combined Financial Statements were prepared
to reflect the Elevator Technology Business as historically included in the IFRS consolidated financial statements
of thyssenkrupp AG. Such combined financial statements are, however, subject to certain limitations. For
example, in order to reflect the assets, liabilities, income, taxes and expenses that fall within the scope of the
Group, various combination rules as well as a series of assumptions and estimates have been applied. Our
management used significant judgement in determining these combination rules, assumptions and estimates,
which may prove to be inaccurate or inapplicable to the Group on a stand-alone basis. For example, our
statement of profit or loss for the three financial years presented in the Audited Combined Financial Statements
include central cost allocations from thyssenkrupp Group, comprising our share of thyssenkrupp AG’s overhead
costs for the relevant year. However, the Group does not consider these costs to be representative of the standalone costs it will bear following the Acquisition. As a result of the foregoing, the Audited Combined Financial
Statements contained in the Offering Memorandum do not necessarily reflect the results of operations, financial
position or cash flows of the Group if it had existed as a separate reporting group in the periods presented.

**_Services to be provided by the thyssenkrupp Group to the Group based on the existing service relationships_**
**_may be insufficient to cover our needs as a stand-alone company and the Group may be unable to_**
**_subsequently replace the services provided by the thyssenkrupp Group after the Acquisition without_**
**_operational problems or additional cost._**

We have ongoing service relationships and agreements with the thyssenkrupp Group pursuant to which the
thyssenkrupp Group has provided certain services to the Group in the past. These services include, among others,
accounting services, IT, procurement, intellectual property, treasury and financing, human resources, legal and
compliance. Following the Acquisition, thyssenkrupp Group will continue to provide a reduced selection of these
services to the Group, including services such as accounting and risk services, IT, procurement, real estate,
human resources, compliance tax (in certain jurisdictions) and other related functions, under the New TSAs and
the Additional Service Agreements, for a transitional period from the Acquisition Closing Date. The Group
expects that it will be dependent on these services provided by the thyssenkrupp Group, for the duration of the
agreements pursuant to which they will be provided. For more information see “Certain Relationships and
_Related Party Transactions—Services provided by the thyssenkrupp Group to the Group—Ongoing Relationships_
_and Services Provided by the thyssenkrupp Group—Transitional Service Agreements (“TSAs”).”_

It is possible that such ongoing service relationships and agreements will be insufficient to cover our needs as a
stand-alone company or that the agreements pursuant to which they are provided may contain terms and conditions
that are not favorable to the Group or not competitive with alternatives in the market. In addition, failure by the
thyssenkrupp Group to perform the services provided for under the service arrangements and agreements may result
in operational problems and increased costs to the Group. The services to be provided by the thyssenkrupp Group
after the Acquisition may not function as efficiently as they did prior to the Acquisition and the Group may find it
difficult to find a suitable alternative supplier of such services in a timely fashion or at all. Any of the foregoing
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_The Group may be exposed to taxation risks relating to the carve-out, in particular in the United States._**

In connection with our separation from thyssenkrupp Group, shares and interests in legal entities have been sold
and transferred, contributed or distributed, as the case may be, to separate the activities of the business area

63


-----

“Elevator Technology” from the other business areas of the remaining thyssenkrupp Group. See “—The Target’s
_corporate structure has undergone substantial organizational changes in the context of the carve-out and_
_separation from the thyssenkrupp Group, making it very challenging to transparently assess past and future_
_Group performance and legal risks.”_

In the United States, certain steps were implemented to allow for a transfer of the US entities of the Group (indirectly)
to the Target. Such steps included the transfer of the US entities belonging to the remaining thyssenkrupp Group,
which previously had been held by thyssenkrupp Elevator USA Holding Corp. to a German entity that is part of the
remaining thyssenkrupp Group via a share distribution (the “US Distribution”). The US Distribution is expected to be
treated as a taxable distribution to thyssenkrupp Elevator USA Holding Corp., such that it is expected to recognize
income for US federal and applicable state and local income tax purposes in connection with the US Distribution.
However, the members of the Group are also expected to have sufficient net operating losses available to offset such
income, such that there is not expected to be a remaining corporate-level US federal income cash tax liability as a result
of such gain recognition. There is a risk that state or local taxes may be imposed on the Group on any gain incurred in
connection with the US Distribution to the extent there are insufficient state or local net operating losses to offset the
gain that is taxable for the relevant state or local tax purposes.

The US Distribution might also raise potential US withholding tax issues. However, thyssenkrupp AG has
received tax advice to the effect that the US Distribution should not be subject to withholding taxes in the United
States. Nonetheless, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) could assert that the US Distribution is
subject to US withholding taxes or other taxes. If the IRS were successful in taking this position, the Group could
be subject to significant US federal income withholding tax liability.

The reorganization of the thyssenkrupp Group may have other tax consequences in the United States, or in a
broad range of other jurisdictions, due to the global nature of our business. Among other things, it is anticipated
that indirect transfers of shares (i.e. where shares in the shareholder of a specific entity are transferred) may be
subject to tax in various jurisdictions where the Group conducts business.

thyssenkrupp AG would be required, pursuant to the provisions of the Share Purchase Agreement, to bear any
cash taxes relating to the reorganization of the thyssenkrupp Group (including US federal, state and local income
taxes, any US federal income withholding taxes arising from the US Distribution and, to a certain extent, indirect
transfer taxes in various jurisdictions where the Group conducts business, as described above), subject to certain
exclusions and limitations. Should thyssenkrupp AG not have sufficient funds to settle its indemnification
obligation vis-a-vis the Target, such liability would have to be borne by the Group, which could in turn have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and prospects.

Although the Group believes its tax estimates and positions with respect to its potential tax liability are
reasonable, the final determination of any such taxes is made by tax authorities, whose views could differ from
the estimates and positions of the Group. Any obligation to pay additional taxes beyond those anticipated and
budgeted for by the Group, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations or prospects.

**_Our market image may be influenced by thyssenkrupp Group’s image for a period after the Acquisition_**
**_Closing Date and our new brand may not appeal to our customers._**

We currently use “thyssenkrupp” as part of our product marks, corporate marks and as part of the company
names, business designations and domains to operate our business which is licensed from thyssenkrupp AG.
Under the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, we are required to make commercially reasonable best efforts
to introduce a new brand for our business within six months after the Acquisition Closing Date. Further, the
existing licensing arrangement to use the mark “thyssenkrupp” will cease at the end of eighteen months from the
Acquisition Closing Date. Until we announce a new brand for our business, we could be seen as still being
connected to the thyssenkrupp Group. Negative publicity or problems associated with companies of the
thyssenkrupp Group during this period, even if unrelated to us and our business, could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or prospects.

Additionally, we cannot predict if our new brand, once announced, will appeal to our customers. Any failure of
our new brand in generating the expected brand recall with our customers could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations or prospects.

**_As we set up our own information technology infrastructure and transitions, our data to its own systems, we_**
**_could incur substantial additional costs and experience temporary business interruptions._**

After the Acquisition, our core IT infrastructure and systems will continue to be highly integrated with the
thyssenkrupp Group. thyssenkrupp AG will therefore continue to provide IT services to us, including

64


-----

infrastructure, license and application services under the New TSAs (the “IT Services”). Pursuant to the New
TSAs, the IT Services shall continue to be provided essentially in the same manner and scope as prior to the
Acquisition Closing Date. However, we will seek to migrate the provision of the IT Services to our own
independent IT services, either internally or through third parties, in order to support our critical business
functions. This migration may result in the Group incurring higher implementation and running costs than the
current IT Services. Additionally, failure to migrate the IT Services effectively and efficiently could result in
operational interruptions, and could disrupt our business and lead to third party claims (and consequential
liability) which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operations.

**Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure**

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could materially adversely affect our business, financial_**
**_position and results of operations and preclude us from satisfying our obligations under the Notes and the_**
**_Note Guarantees._**

Following the completion of the Transactions, we will be highly leveraged and have significant debt service
obligations. As of March 31, 2020, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, we would have had total
indebtedness (excluding lease liabilities amounting to €330 million) in the amount of €8,254 million, consisting
of the Notes, the Private Senior Notes, the Senior Term Facilities and certain local facilities. See
“Capitalization,” “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements,” “Description of the Senior Secured Notes”
and “Description of the Senior Notes.” We anticipate that our high leverage will continue to exist for the
foreseeable future.

The degree to which we will be leveraged following completion of the Transactions could have important
consequences to holders of the Notes, including, but not limited to:

- making it more difficult for the Issuers and their subsidiaries to satisfy their respective obligations with
respect to the Notes, the Senior Facilities and other debt and liabilities we may incur;

- increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and
industry conditions;

- requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal
of, and interest on, our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund working
capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures, product research and development, or other
general corporate purposes;

- restricting us from pursuing acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities;

- limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the competitive environment
and the industry in which we operate;

- negatively impacting credit terms with our suppliers and other creditors;

- increasing our exposure to interest rate increases because some of our indebtedness bears a floating rate of
interest;

- placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged;

- limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future operations, capital expenditures, business
opportunities, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and increasing the cost of any future
borrowings; and

- limiting our ability to obtain additional capacity for issuance of bid, advance payment, performance and
warranty guarantees for operative business purposes and increasing the cost of any future guarantee
issuances.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our
obligations, including under the Notes, the Private Senior Notes and the Senior Facilities.

**_The Issuers are holding companies that have no revenue generating operations of their own and will depend_**
**_on cash from the operating companies of the Group to be able to make payments on the Notes and the Note_**
**_Guarantees._**

The Issuers are holding companies with no business operations other than management of the equity interests
they hold in each of their respective subsidiaries. Following consummation of the Acquisition, the Issuers will be

dependent upon the cash flow from their operating subsidiaries in the form of dividends or other distributions or
payments to meet their obligations, including their obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees. Given
the Group’s international operations, it has a large number of operating subsidiaries and business participations,
which individually contribute to our Group’s results. The amounts of dividends and distributions available to the
Issuers will depend on the profitability and cash flows of their subsidiaries and the ability of each of those
subsidiaries to declare dividends under applicable law or transfer profits under profit and loss transfer
agreements, if applicable. The Issuers’ subsidiaries, however, may not be able to, or may not be permitted under
applicable law to, make distributions or advance upstream loans to the Issuers to make payments in respect of
their indebtedness, including the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

Various agreements governing our debt may restrict and, in some cases may actually prohibit, the ability of these
subsidiaries to move cash within their restricted group. In particular, the Senior Facilities and the Senior Secured
Notes limit the ability to upstream cash to the SUN Issuer subject to certain exceptions. Applicable tax laws may
also subject such payments to further taxation. Applicable law as well as profit and loss transfer agreements
between several entities of the Group may also limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries will be permitted
to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or even prevent such payments. In particular, the
ability of the Issuers’ subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Issuers will generally be limited to the amount of
distributable reserves available to each of them and the ability to pay their respective debt when due. The Target
is organized under German law which provides that dividends may only be distributed out of current profits and
distributable reserves, and, generally, interim dividend distributions are not allowed under German law. The
subsidiaries of the Issuers that do not guarantee the Notes have no direct obligation to make payments with
respect to the Notes or the Note Guarantees.

While the Indentures limit the ability of the Issuers’ subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability
to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments, these limitations are subject to significant qualifications
and exceptions, including exceptions for restrictions imposed by applicable law.

**_We may incur substantially more debt in the future, which may make it difficult for us to service our debt,_**
**_including the Notes, and impair our ability to operate our businesses._**

Despite our substantial leverage, we may incur substantial additional debt in the future. We have the ability to
borrow up to €1,000 million (equivalent) under our Revolving Credit Facility and up to €1,000 million
(equivalent) in guarantees under our Guarantee Facility, which will be secured, in each case, by the SSN
Collateral, and the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Indentures also permit the incurrence of additional debt
thereunder. The Indentures and the Senior Facilities Agreement also permit us to incur a substantial amount of
indebtedness at subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes and to incur indebtedness that shares in the Collateral
or that benefits from security interests over assets that do not secure the Notes. Any debt that our subsidiaries
incur could be structurally or effectively senior to the Notes to the extent that such subsidiaries do not guarantee
the Notes such debt is secured by liens that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of such property
and assets securing such debt, and other debt could be secured or could mature prior to the Notes. Although the
Senior Facilities Agreement and the Indentures will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional
indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under
certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions
could be substantial. If new debt is added to the Issuers’ and their subsidiaries’ existing debt levels, the related
risks that we now face would increase. In addition, the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Indentures will not
prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements. Our inability to
service our debt could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and
our ability to fulfil our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

**_Due to restrictions on the deductibility of interest expenses or forfeiture of interest carry forwards under_**
**_applicable law, we may be unable to fully deduct interest expenses on our financial liabilities._**

A certain amount of our annual financing expenses (primarily including interest payments) is not deductible
under existing interest limitation rules, especially the German interest barrier rules (Zinsschranke) as further
described below. Subject to certain requirements, the German interest barrier rules impose certain restrictions on
the deductibility of interest expense for German tax purposes. The German interest barrier rules generally
provide for a limitation on the deduction of net interest expenses in excess of 30% of tax adjusted EBITDA. For
purposes of the interest barrier rules, all entities that are part of the same fiscal unity (Organschaft) for corporate
income and trade tax purposes are treated as one single business. Any non-deductible amount exceeding the
threshold of 30% is carried forward and may be, again subject to the interest barrier rules, deductible in future
financial years. Any interest carryforward may be forfeited in part or in full in connection with certain measures,

such as a change of the ownership structure. Upon closing of the Acquisition, certain Group companies may
forfeit their existing interest carryforwards on the Acquisition Closing Date. Furthermore, on June 20, 2016, the
European Council adopted the Directive (EU) 2016/1164 laying down rules against tax avoidance practices that
directly affect the functioning of the internal market. The Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive contains five legally
binding anti abuse measures, which all member states will be required to apply against common forms of
aggressive tax planning from January 1, 2017 onwards. Part of the package of measures is the implementation of
an interest limitation in line with German rules. The restriction of the deductibility of interest expenses for tax
purposes may have adverse consequences for our financial position and results of operations. The European
Council has also adopted Directive (EU) 2017/952 (ATAD II) targeting mismatches which needed to be
implemented by December 31, 2019, but have not been enacted in Germany to date. The German ministry of
finance issued a new draft bill on the implementation of the aforementioned directives on December 10, 2019,
and published an update of such draft bill on March 24, 2020. Amongst others, according to this draft bill,
expenditures for intercompany financing may be disallowed in the current and future tax periods. The draft bill
intends to broaden the existing rules on corresponding inclusions and deductions of income and expenses and
introduces provisions to counter tax shortfalls due to mismatches from the use of hybrid financial instruments or
hybrid entities or due to dual tax residency and, furthermore, introduces new arm’s length provisions on
intercompany financing that may ultimately limit the deduction of interest expenses on intercompany loans. If the
draft bill is enacted and depending on the final wording of the new legislation, the introduction of aforesaid rules
could result in higher taxable income and a higher tax burden for corporate income tax and trade tax purposes in
the current and future tax periods. Further measures may follow as part of the Organization for Economic
Co-operation and Development’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project.

The use of existing or future tax loss carryforwards and ongoing losses for German corporate income and trade
tax purposes may be forfeited in case of a direct or indirect transfer of shares, subject to certain limited
exceptions. Such restriction, applying to both corporate income and trade tax, depends on the percentage of share
capital or voting rights transferred within a five year period to one acquirer or person(s) closely related to the
acquirer or a group of acquirers with a common interest. Under current rules, if more than 50% of the share
capital or voting rights are transferred to such an acquirer, tax loss carryforwards and current losses will be
forfeited to the extent no exception from the general forfeiture rules can be applied, such as the built-in gains
exemption pursuant to which tax loss carryforwards survive to the extent taxable built-in gains are available at
the level of the loss-carrying entity. The German Federal Constitutional Court, in a decision dated March 29,
2017 and published May 12, 2017, has held that the German tax loss forfeiture rules, in a version which was
effective from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2015, violate the German constitution to the extent they stipulate
a partial forfeiture of a company’s current and carried forward tax losses upon a transfer of more than 25% but
less than 50% of its shares. According to this decision, the German legislator is required to amend the current tax
loss forfeiture rules in respect of the aforementioned period and transfer of shares, so they are consistent with the
German constitution. Meanwhile, the German legislator has made changes to the relevant provisions of German
law with the effect, that a transfer of more than 25% but less than 50% of the shares does not have the
consequences that losses are forfeited. However, currently, another proceeding is pending at the German Federal
Constitutional Court regarding whether forfeiture upon ownership changes of more than 50% is constitutional.
To the extent that the utilization of tax losses is restricted, they cannot be set off against future tax profits which
would result in higher future tax burdens compared to the situation in which tax loss carryforwards can be used to
lower the actual tax burden on profits. Such restriction may require a write down of the deferred tax assets in our
consolidated financial statements and would negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.

Furthermore, upon the creation of a fiscal unity for German corporate and trade tax purposes, any tax loss
carryforwards and interest carry forwards for German corporate income and trade tax purposes of a subsidiary, which
have been incurred before the creation of the fiscal unity, will be excluded from use for the duration of the fiscal unity.

**_Following the consummation of the Transactions, we will be subject to restrictive covenants that will limit our_**
**_operating and financial flexibility._**

The Senior Facilities Agreement and the Indentures will contain covenants which impose significant operating
and financial restrictions on us. These agreements will limit our ability to, among other things:

- incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock;

- make certain restricted payments and investments;

- transfer or sell assets;

- enter into transactions with affiliates;

67


-----

- create or incur certain liens;

- make certain loans, investments or acquisitions;

- issue or sell share capital of certain of our subsidiaries;

- create or incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments to
us;

- take certain actions that would impair the security interests in the Collateral granted for the benefit of the
holders of the Notes;

- merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; and

- pay or redeem subordinated debt or equity.

All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes—Certain Covenants” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Certain Covenants.” The covenants_
to which we will be subject could limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and our
ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest.

In addition, the Senior Facilities Agreement will require us to comply with certain affirmative covenants while
amounts under the Senior Facilities remain outstanding. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, the Revolving
Credit Facility and Guarantee Facility under the Senior Facilities Agreement will require us to comply with a
financial ratio while amounts exceeding a certain threshold remain outstanding under the Revolving Credit
Facility and Guarantee Facility. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Facilities
_Agreement.” Our ability to meet the financial ratio under the Senior Facilities Agreement may be affected by_
events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet such financial ratio. A breach of any of
the covenants or restrictions under the Senior Facilities Agreement, including our failure to comply with the
financial ratio thereunder, could result in an event of default under the Senior Facilities Agreement. Upon the
occurrence of a payment event of default that is continuing under the Senior Facilities Agreement, subject to the
applicable cure period, and upon the acceleration of indebtedness with respect to any other event of default by the
creditors under our Senior Facilities Agreement, the relevant creditors could cancel the availability of the Senior
Facilities and elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Senior Facilities, together with accrued interest,
immediately due and payable. In addition, a default under the Senior Facilities, including our failure to comply
with the financial ratio under the Revolving Credit Facility and Guarantee Facility, could lead to an event of
default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross default or cross acceleration provisions,
including the Indentures. If our creditors, including the creditors under the Senior Facilities, accelerate the
payment of those amounts, we cannot assure you that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be
sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries that would be due and
payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the Notes. In addition, if we are unable to repay those
amounts, our creditors could proceed against any Collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those
amounts.

**_We will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations, which we may not_**
**_be able to generate or raise._**

Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including the Senior Facilities
and our obligations under the Notes, and to fund our ongoing operations or expansion plans, will depend on our
future performance and ability to generate cash, which, to a certain extent, is subject to the success of our
business strategy as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, legal, regulatory and other
factors, as well as other factors discussed in these “Risk Factors,” many of which are beyond our control.
We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that currently
anticipated growth, cost savings or efficiencies will be realized or that future debt financing will be available to
us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund our other
liquidity needs including the repayment at maturity of the then outstanding amount under the Senior Facilities. At
the maturity of the Senior Facilities (including the Revolving Credit Facility and the Guarantee Facility, which
mature six months before the Senior Secured Notes and 18 months before the Senior Notes), the Notes or any
other debt that we may incur, if we do not have sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital resources
to pay our debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be required to refinance or restructure
our indebtedness.

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations as they
mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

- sell assets;

68


-----

- obtain additional debt or equity capital; or

- restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.

The type, timing and terms of any future financing, restructuring, asset sales or other capital raising transactions
will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We cannot assure you that
we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In
such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay any portion or all of our debt.

Any failure to make payments on the Notes on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit
rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the terms of our debt,
including the Notes and the Senior Facilities, will limit, and any future debt may limit, our ability to pursue any
of these alternatives. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply
with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business, financial position and results of
operations. There can be no assurances that any assets that we could be required to dispose of could be sold or
that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of proceeds realized from such sale would be acceptable. If
we are unsuccessful in any of these efforts, we may not have sufficient cash to meet our obligations.

**_Some of our indebtedness, including the SSN EUR FRN Notes, the Private Senior Notes and the Senior_**
**_Facilities, will bear interest at floating rates that could rise significantly, thereby increasing our costs and_**
**_reducing our cash flow._**

Debt under the Senior Facilities will bear interest at a variable rate based on the Euro Interbank Offered Rate
(EURIBOR) and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) (in each case, subject to a zero floor if less than
zero) plus an applicable margin. The SSN EUR FRN Notes will also bear interest at a variable rate based on
EURIBOR (subject to a zero floor if less than zero) plus an applicable margin. These interest rates could rise
significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow
available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes. Neither the Senior
Facilities Agreement nor the Indentures contain a covenant requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our
floating rate debt.

Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates,
there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging
itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate
any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to rise significantly, our interest expense would
correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow.

Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, a different measure of interbank lending rates, regulators and
law enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union are conducting investigations
into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily EURIBOR or the
calculation of LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate EURIBOR and LIBOR. In
addition, LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be
“benchmarks” are the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform, including the
implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European
regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the
performance of investment funds, which entered into force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of
any such reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may
perform differently than in the past, or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other
consequences which cannot be predicted. For example, on July 27, 2017, the UK Financial Conduct Authority
announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR
benchmark after 2021 (the “FCA Announcement”). The FCA Announcement indicates that the continuation of
LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. The potential elimination of the
LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or
actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or
LIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other
consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including but not limited to the Senior Facilities
whose interest rates are linked to LIBOR and EURIBOR). Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or
the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which
could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest. In
addition, on November 29, 2017, the Bank of England and the FCA announced that the market working group on
Sterling Risk-Free Rates would have an extended mandate to catalyze a broad transition to the Sterling Over
Night Index Average Rate (“SONIA”) across sterling bond, loan and derivatives markets so that SONIA is

69


-----

established as the primary sterling interest rate benchmark by the end of 2021. The Bank of England and FCA
have stated that a key near-term priority for the working group will be to make recommendations relating to the
potential development of SONIA reference rates. A public consultation was launched in July 2018 in relation to
specific queries related to the operations of SONIA reference rates. On April 23, 2018, the Bank of England took
over administration of SONIA and issued a series of reforms as part of its implementation as a replacement to
LIBOR. From April 2018, the Bank of England has been setting the interest rate benchmark using SONIA,
meaning that banks are no longer compelled by the FCA to submit LIBOR rates beyond 2021. These reforms and
other pressures may cause such benchmarks to disappear entirely, to perform differently than in the past (as a
result of a change in methodology or otherwise), create disincentives for market participants to continue to
administer or participate in certain benchmarks or have other consequences which cannot be predicted.

**_The interests of the Sponsors may conflict with your interests as a holder of the Notes._**

Giving effect to the Transactions, the Sponsors will, together with thyssenkrupp AG, indirectly own all of the
shares of the Issuers and the Target. As a result, our shareholders have and will continue to have, directly or
indirectly, the power to affect our legal and capital structure as well as the ability to elect and change our
management and to approve other changes to our operations and to influence the outcome of matters requiring
action by our shareholders. Our shareholders’ interests in certain circumstances may conflict with your interests
as noteholders, particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. For
example, the shareholders could vote to cause us to incur additional indebtedness. Our shareholders are in the
business of making investments in companies and may acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete
directly or indirectly with us. Our shareholders may also pursue acquisition opportunities that are complementary
to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. In addition, our
shareholders have held, hold or may hold interests in suppliers or customers of the Group. Our shareholders and
their affiliates could also have an interest in pursuing divestitures (including one or more divestitures of all or
part of our business or sales of our shares which would result in changes to our shareholding structure),
financings, dividend distributions or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity
investments, although such transactions might involve risks to you as a holder of Notes.

**Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes**

**_The Senior Secured Notes will not be initially secured by all of the SSN Collateral._**

On the Issue Date, and until up to 150 days after the Acquisition Closing Date (if such event occurs at all), the
Senior Secured Notes will not be secured by all of the Collateral, as further described under “Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes—Security.” On the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be secured only (i) by a first-_
ranking pledge over the relevant Escrow Accounts and (ii) subject to the Agreed Security Principles, on a firstpriority basis, by security interests in the SSN Issue Date Collateral. We will agree in the Senior Secured
Indenture to take such necessary actions to secure the Senior Secured Notes within 150 days from (and
excluding) the Acquisition Closing Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and substantially
simultaneously with the obligations under the Senior Facilities, by first-priority security interests in the SSN
Post-Closing Collateral. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in procuring such liens
within the time periods specified, the failure of which would result in an “event of default” under the Senior
Secured Indenture. The security interests will be limited to the same extent as those under the Senior Facilities
and otherwise as set forth under “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests,” which limitations could be significant. See also_
“—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance
_and other limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and_
_enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral.” It should be noted that if a guarantee or a security_
interest granted by a Guarantor in certain jurisdictions is granted or perfected after the secured obligation arose,
such guarantee or security interest may be subject to clawback provisions under applicable local insolvency laws.
See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note
_Guarantees and Security Interests.”_

**_If the Revolving Credit Facility is designated as a super senior liability in accordance with the terms of the_**
**_Intercreditor Agreement, creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging_**
**_obligations and future indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Senior Secured Indenture_**
**_and the Intercreditor Agreement ranking pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility are entitled to be repaid_**
**_with proceeds from the enforcement of the SSN Collateral in priority over the Senior Secured Notes._**

The Intercreditor Agreement includes provisions governing the sharing of proceeds from enforcement of the SSN
Collateral. Such enforcement proceeds are required to be turned over to the Security Agent after certain events,

70


-----

including the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes. The Security Agent is required to apply turned over
amounts and other recoveries by the Security Agent from enforcement actions toward discharging the super
senior obligations (including, among others, (following the designation of the Revolving Credit Facility as a
super senior liability in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) those under the Revolving
Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations and future indebtedness that may be secured on a super senior basis
(the “Super Senior Liabilities”)) in priority to applying any such amounts toward discharging the Senior Secured
Notes. As such, in the event of a foreclosure of the SSN Collateral, you may not benefit from such recoveries if
the then outstanding claims under such Super Senior Liabilities are greater than the proceeds recovered. Any
proceeds remaining from an enforcement sale of SSN Collateral will, after all obligations under such Super
Senior Liabilities have been discharged, be applied pro rata in repayment of the Senior Term Facilities, the
Guarantee Facility, the Senior Secured Notes, (if the Revolving Credit Facility has not been designated as a super
senior liability in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) the Revolving Credit Facility and
any other indebtedness that ranks pari passu with the Senior Secured Notes.

Furthermore, claims of our secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also secure the Senior Secured
Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Senior Secured Notes. As
such, the claims of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will be effectively subordinated to the rights of such
secured creditors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.

**_The SSN Issuers and the Guarantors will have control over the SSN Collateral, and the sale of particular_**
**_assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Senior Secured Notes._**

The Security Documents relating to the Senior Secured Notes will allow the SSN Issuers, the Guarantors and the
other SSN Collateral providers to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and
collect, invest and dispose of any income from the SSN Collateral to the extent that it relates to their assets. So
long as no acceleration event has occurred and subject to certain conditions, the SSN Issuers, the Guarantors and
the other SSN Collateral providers may, among other things, without any release or consent by the Security
Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the SSN Collateral, such as selling, factoring,
abandoning or otherwise disposing of the SSN Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments, including
repayments of indebtedness.

**_Holders of the Senior Secured Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the SSN Collateral._**

The obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof are secured on a first ranking
basis with security interests over the SSN Collateral that also secure our obligations under the Super Senior
Liabilities. The Senior Secured Indenture also permits the SSN Collateral to secure additional indebtedness in
accordance with the terms thereof and the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that
the Security Agent will only enforce the SSN Collateral as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement, and the
Senior Secured Indenture regulates the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to
instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action.

Prior to the EUR SSN Issuer designating any liabilities as Super Senior Liabilities in accordance with the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement (the “Designation Date”), the Security Agent is not required to take enforcement
action unless instructed to do so by an instructing group that consists of the holders of the aggregate principal
amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes, the senior lenders, creditors in respect of indebtedness
ranking pari passu with the senior creditors and creditors in respect of certain non-priority hedging obligations
(the “Senior Secured Credit Participations”) which aggregate more than 50% of the total Senior Secured Credit
Participations at that time (the “Majority Senior Secured Creditors”) (in each case acting through their respective
creditor representatives). If the Majority Senior Secured Creditors do not instruct the Security Agent to enforce,
or instruct the Security Agent to cease enforcing the transaction security, then, in certain cases, creditors holding
more than 50% of the total second lien credit participations (or, in certain cases, creditors holding 50% of the
total topco credit participations) may instruct the Security Agent to enforce.

Following the Designation Date, the Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless instructed
to do so by an instructing group that may consist of either (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or
(ii) creditors holding more than 50% of the total participations in Super Senior Liabilities at that time (the
“Majority Super Senior Creditors”). The Security Agent is required to act in accordance with instructions
received from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, however: (i) if and to the extent the obligations under the
Super Senior Liabilities have not been fully discharged in cash within six months of enforcement instructions
first being issued by either the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors; or
(ii) if the Security Agent has not commenced enforcement action within three months of enforcement instructions

71


-----

first being issued by either the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors, then
the enforcement instructions provided by the Majority Super Senior Creditors will prevail.

Following the transaction security having become enforceable, if (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have
not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue and
(ii) (x) the Majority Super Senior Creditors determine in good faith that to delay issuing enforcement instructions
could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any
transaction security or the realization of enforcement proceeds and (y) deliver enforcement instructions which
they reasonably believe to be consistent with the enforcement principles and necessary or desirable to enhance
the prospects of achieving the enforcement objectives before the security agent has received any enforcement
instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, in such circumstances, the Security Agent shall act in
accordance with the enforcement instructions received from the Majority Super Senior Creditors.

If at any time an insolvency event has occurred with respect to any debtor (other than an insolvency event which
is the direct result of any action taken by the Security Agent acting on the instructions of the Majority Super
Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors), the Security Agent shall act (i) prior to the
Designation Date, in accordance with the instructions of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (without any
requirement to first consult with any junior creditors) or (ii) after the Designation Date and to the extent the
Majority Super Senior Creditors have provided such instructions, in accordance with the instructions received
from the Majority Super Senior Creditors.

The Security Agent is not obliged to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the
performance of its duties, obligations or responsibilities or the exercise of any right, power, authority or
discretion if it has grounds for believing the repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against, or security
for, such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it by a member of the Group. In connection with any
enforcement instructions received by it, the Security Agent may request security and/or indemnity and/or
prefunding satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense (including legal fees).

To the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured
Notes (such as indebtedness under the Senior Facilities Agreement), the voting interest of holders of Senior
Secured Notes in an instructing group will be diluted commensurate with the amount of indebtedness we incur.

The creditors of any Super Senior Liabilities may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of
the Senior Secured Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their
remedies under the Security Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Senior
Secured Notes to do so. In addition, if the Security Agent sells SSN Collateral consisting of the shares of the
EUR SSN Issuer or any of its subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Note Guarantees and the liens over any other assets of such entities
securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Note Guarantees may be released. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security—_
_Release of Liens.”_

Delays in enforcement could decrease or eliminate recovery values. In addition, the holders of the Senior Secured
Notes will not have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Security Documents or to
exercise any rights or powers arising under the Security Documents, except through the Security Agent as
provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting the Senior Secured Notes, you will be deemed to have
agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Senior Secured Notes will have limited
remedies and recourse against the SSN Issuers and the Guarantors in the event of a default. See “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

**_The Senior Secured Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the SSN Collateral that will be_**
**_granted as security for the Senior Secured Notes and future secured indebtedness may be secured by certain_**
**_assets that do not secure the Senior Secured Notes._**

The Senior Secured Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the SSN Collateral. See “Description
_of the Senior Secured Notes—Security.” In addition, the SSN Collateral will also secure the Senior Facilities and_
a portion of the SSN Collateral, the Shared Collateral, will also secure the Senior Notes on a second priority
basis. Not all of our assets will secure the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Indenture will allow the
SSN Issuers and their restricted subsidiaries to secure any future Senior Secured Indebtedness (as defined in the
Senior Secured Indenture) permitted to be incurred under the Senior Secured Indenture (which may be
structurally senior to the Senior Secured Notes and the Note Guarantees) with the property and assets of the SSN
Issuers and the restricted subsidiaries that do not secure the Senior Secured Notes. The value of such assets and

72


-----

property could be significant. If an event of default occurs and the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes are
accelerated, the Senior Secured Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof will not benefit from the assets securing
such secured debt and will rank equally with the holders of other unsecured indebtedness of the SSN Issuers and
their restricted subsidiaries with respect to any property or assets excluded from the SSN Collateral securing the
Senior Secured Notes.

While the Senior Secured Indenture will create certain obligations to provide additional guarantees and grant
additional security over assets, or a particular class of assets, whether as a result of the acquisition or creation of
future assets or subsidiaries or otherwise, such obligations are subject to the Agreed Security Principles. The
Agreed Security Principles that will be set forth in the Senior Secured Indenture will set out a number of
limitations on the rights of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to be granted security or guarantees in certain
circumstances. The operation of the Agreed Security Principles may result in, among other things, the amount
recoverable under any SSN Collateral provided being limited or security not being granted over a particular type
or class of assets. Accordingly, the Agreed Security Principles may affect the value of the security or guarantees
provided by the SSN Issuers and the Guarantors.

**_The value of the SSN Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our_**
**_obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and such collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain_**
**_circumstances._**

If we default on the Senior Secured Notes, holders of the Senior Secured Notes will be secured only to the extent
of the value of the assets underlying the security interests granted in favor of holders of the Senior Secured
Notes. In the event of an enforcement of the security interests in respect of the SSN Collateral, the proceeds from
the sale of the assets underlying the SSN Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the SSN Issuers’ obligations
with respect to the Senior Secured Notes. No appraisal of the value of the SSN Collateral has been made in
connection with this Offering. The value of the assets underlying the pledges will also depend on many factors,
including, among other things, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, regulatory restrictions that
could affect such sale, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale and the condition of the economies in which
operations are located and the availability of buyers.

The shares and other SSN Collateral that will be pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Senior
Secured Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Senior Secured Notes, in part because most of such
collateral may not be liquid and its value to other parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot
assure you that the SSN Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the
liquidation thereof. Industry regulations in certain jurisdictions in which we operate, such as Germany, include
restrictions on persons who may hold certain of our licenses, authorizations and consents that are necessary to
operate our business. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of our business operations may be prohibited or
only permitted to a limited group of investors eligible to hold such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of
potential buyers. Furthermore, entry into the Security Documents, enforcement of the SSN Collateral and any
transfer of our operations may require, in certain jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents,
approvals or filings or might otherwise be challenged. Such consents, approvals or filings may take time to
obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result, enforcement may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of
operations may occur and the value of the SSN Collateral may be significantly decreased. Most of our assets do
not secure the Senior Secured Notes and it is possible that the value of the SSN Collateral will not be sufficient to
cover the amount of indebtedness secured by such SSN Collateral. With respect to any shares of our subsidiaries
pledged to secure the Senior Secured Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof, such shares may also have limited
value in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that
have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be
satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge
of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition,
the value of the SSN Collateral may decline over time. If the proceeds of the SSN Collateral are not sufficient to
repay all amounts due on the Senior Secured Notes, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes (to the extent not
repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the SSN Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated
claim against the SSN Issuers’ and the Guarantors’ remaining assets.

The Senior Secured Indenture will also permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the
holders of the Senior Secured Notes on the SSN Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured
indebtedness or third parties enjoy liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Senior
Secured Indenture or the Security Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with
respect to the SSN Collateral which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations
under the Senior Secured Notes. Moreover, if we issue additional Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured

73


-----

Indenture, holders of such Senior Secured Notes would benefit from the same collateral as the holders of the
Senior Secured Notes being offered hereby, thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on the SSN
Collateral.

**Risks Relating to the Senior Notes**

**_The SUN Issuer and the Guarantors will have control over the SUN Collateral, and the sale of particular_**
**_assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Senior Notes._**

The Security Documents relating to the Senior Notes will allow the SUN Collateral providers to remain in
possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from
the SUN Collateral to the extent that it relates to their assets. So long as no acceleration event has occurred and
subject to certain conditions, the SUN Collateral providers may, among other things, without any release or
consent by the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the SUN Collateral, such as
selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of the SUN Collateral and making ordinary course cash
payments, including repayments of indebtedness.

**_The Senior Notes are subordinated to certain debt incurred by the SSN Issuers and their subsidiaries._**

The Senior Notes will be contractually subordinated in right of payment to all of the SUN Issuer’s existing and
future indebtedness that is expressly senior in right of payment to the Senior Notes, including its obligations in
respect of the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Facilities, structurally subordinated to any existing or future
indebtedness of the subsidiaries of the SUN Issuer that do not guarantee the Senior Notes, including their
obligations to trade creditors, and effectively subordinated to all of the SUN Issuer’s existing and future
indebtedness that is secured by liens that do not secure the Senior Notes, to the extent of the value of such
property and assets securing such indebtedness. In the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or
other winding up, our assets that secure debt ranking senior or equal in right of payment to the Senior Notes will
be available to pay obligations on the Senior Notes on a pro rata basis with debt ranking equal in right of
payment to the Senior Notes only after the senior secured debt has been repaid in full from these assets. There
may not be sufficient assets remaining to pay amounts due on any or all of the Senior Notes then outstanding.
The Senior Notes Indenture will not prohibit us from incurring additional secured debt, nor will it prohibit any of
our subsidiaries from incurring additional liabilities.

**_Your right to receive payment under the Senior Note Guarantees is contractually subordinated to senior_**
**_ranking debt of the Guarantors._**

The obligations of the Guarantors under their respective Senior Note Guarantee are general senior obligations of
such Guarantors and will be contractually subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of
all existing and future obligations in respect of senior ranking debt of such Guarantor. Such debt includes the
guarantees of the Senior Secured Notes or, in the case of the SSN Issuers, their obligations under the Senior
Secured Notes, and the obligations under the Senior Facilities. Although the Senior Notes Indenture will contain
restrictions on the ability of the Guarantors to incur additional debt, any additional debt incurred may be
substantial and rank senior to the Senior Note Guarantee.

Upon any payment or distribution to creditors of a Guarantor under the Senior Notes Indenture in respect of an
insolvency event, the holders of senior ranking debt of such Guarantor will be entitled to be paid in full from the
assets of such Guarantor before any payment may be made pursuant to such Senior Note Guarantee. Until the
senior ranking debt of such Guarantor is paid in full, any distribution to which holders of the Senior Notes would
be entitled but for the subordination provisions included in the Intercreditor Agreement shall instead be made to
holders of senior ranking debt of such Guarantor as their interests may appear. As a result, in the event of
insolvency of a Guarantor under the Senior Notes Indenture, holders of senior ranking debt of such Guarantor
may recover more, ratably, than the holders of Senior Notes, in respect of the Guarantor’s Senior Note
Guarantee.

In addition, the subordination provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement relating to the Senior Note Guarantees
will provide:

- customary turnover provisions by the Trustee and the holders of the Senior Notes for the benefit of the
holders of senior ranking debt of such Guarantor;

- that if a payment default on any senior ranking debt of a Guarantor has occurred and is continuing,
Guarantor may not make any payment in respect of its Senior Note Guarantee until such default is cured or
waived;

74


-----

- that if any other default occurs and is continuing on any designated senior ranking indebtedness that permits
the holders thereof to accelerate its maturity and the Trustee receives a notice of such default, such
Guarantor may not make any payment in respect of the Senior Notes, or pursuant to its Senior Note
Guarantee, until (among others) the earlier of the waiver or cure of such default and 179 days after the date
on which the applicable payment blockage notice is received; and

- that the holders of the Senior Notes and the Trustee are prohibited, without the prior consent of the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors, from taking any enforcement action in
relation to such guarantee, except in certain circumstances.

The Senior Notes Indenture will also provide that, except under very limited circumstances, only the Trustee will
have standing to bring an enforcement action in respect of the Senior Notes and the Senior Note Guarantees.
Moreover, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Notes Indenture will restrict the rights of holders of the
Senior Notes to initiate insolvency proceedings or take legal actions against each of the Guarantors under the
Senior Notes Indenture and by accepting any Senior Note each such holder will be deemed to have agreed to
these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Senior Notes will have limited remedies and
recourse under the Senior Note Guarantees in the event of a default by the SUN Issuer or a Guarantor under the
Senior Notes Indenture.

**_The Shared Collateral secures the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Facilities on a first priority basis, and_**
**_your rights to recover on such Shared Collateral will be limited._**

A portion of the SUN Collateral, the Shared Collateral, will be pledged to the Security Agent for the benefit of
the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and the lenders under the Senior Facilities, as well as to the Security
Agent for the benefit of holders of the Senior Notes. Under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security
Documents, the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Facilities are secured by first ranking security interests in
the Shared Collateral and the proceeds of any sale of the Shared Collateral on enforcement will be applied first to
repay all debt of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and the lenders under the Senior Facilities and certain
hedging obligations. Consequently, you may not be able to recover on such Shared Collateral because the holders
of the Senior Secured Notes and the lenders under the Senior Facilities and counterparties to certain hedging
obligations will have a prior claim on all proceeds realized from any enforcement of such Shared Collateral.

**_The Senior Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the SUN Collateral that will be granted as_**
**_security for the Senior Notes and future secured debt may be secured by certain assets that do not secure the_**
**_Senior Notes._**

The Senior Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the SUN Collateral described in this offering
memorandum. See “Description of the Senior Notes—Security.” In addition, a portion of the SUN Collateral, the
Shared Collateral, will also secure the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Facilities on a first ranking basis, and
may secure additional debt ranking senior to or pari passu with the Senior Notes and the Senior Note Guarantees.
The SUN Collateral will also secure the Private Senior Notes on a pari passu basis with the Senior Notes and the
Senior Note Guarantees. Although the pledge over the shares of the SUN Issuer will secure the Senior Notes and
the Note Guarantees thereof on a first priority basis and will not secure the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior
Facilities, such pledge may secure additional debt ranking pari passu with the Senior Notes, to the extent
permitted by the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The rights of the holders
may therefore be diluted by any increase in the debt secured by the SUN Collateral or a reduction of the SUN
Collateral securing the Senior Notes. In addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the proceeds of an
enforcement of the SSN Collateral will be applied in repayment of any Super Senior Liabilities (to the extent the
Designation Date has occurred), followed by (or unless the Designation Date has not occurred) the Senior
Secured Notes and any lenders under the Senior Facilities, among others, before repayment of the Senior Notes
and Senior Note Guarantees. To the extent the claims of the holders of the Senior Notes exceed the value of the
SUN Collateral securing the Senior Notes and the Senior Note Guarantees, those claims will generally rank
equally with the claims of the holders of all other existing and future senior debt ranking pari passu with the
Senior Notes and the Senior Note Guarantees. As a result, if the value of the assets pledged as SUN Collateral is
less than the value of the claims of the holders of the Senior Notes, those claims may not be satisfied in full. In
addition, not all of our assets will secure the Senior Notes, and the Senior Notes Indenture will allow the SUN
Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to secure certain types of debt permitted to be incurred under the Senior
Notes Indenture (which may be structurally senior to the Senior Notes and the Senior Note Guarantees) with the
property and assets of the restricted subsidiaries that do not secure the Senior Notes. The value of such assets and
property could be significant. If an event of default occurs and the obligations under the Senior Notes are
accelerated, the Senior Notes and the Senior Note Guarantees will not benefit from the assets securing such

75


-----

secured debt and will rank equally with the holders of unsecured debt of the SUN Issuer and its restricted
subsidiaries with respect to any property or assets that is excluded from the SUN Collateral securing the Senior
Notes.

**_The value of the SUN Collateral securing the Senior Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations_**
**_under the Senior Notes and such SUN Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances._**

If we default on the Senior Notes, holders of the Senior Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of
the SUN Collateral granted in favor of holders of the Senior Notes and, in respect of the Shared Collateral, only
after the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and lenders under the Senior Facilities have been paid in full. In the
event of an enforcement of the pledges in respect of the Senior Notes, the proceeds from the sale of the assets
underlying the pledges may not be sufficient to satisfy the SUN Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Senior
Notes including due to the reasons described in the preceding sentence. No appraisal of the value of the SUN
Collateral has been made in connection with this Offering. The value of the assets underlying the pledges will
also depend on many factors, including, among other things, whether or not the business is sold as a going
concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale and the
condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers.

The SUN Collateral that is pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Notes may provide for
only limited repayment of the Senior Notes, in part because most of such collateral may not be liquid and its
value to other parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the SUN Collateral
will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Industry
regulations in certain jurisdictions in which we operate, such as Germany, include restrictions on persons who
may hold certain of our licenses, authorizations and consents that are necessary to operate our business. In the
event of foreclosure, the transfer of our business operations may be prohibited or only permitted to a limited
group of investors eligible to hold such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore,
entry into the Security Documents, enforcement of the SUN Collateral and any transfer of our operations may
require, in certain jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings or might
otherwise be challenged. Such consents, approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at
all. As a result, enforcement may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may occur and the value of the
SUN Collateral may be significantly decreased. Most of our assets will not secure the Senior Notes and it is
possible that the value of the SUN Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness secured
by the SUN Collateral. With respect to any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to secure the Senior Notes and the
Note Guarantees thereof, such shares may also have limited value in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other
similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the
entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, which may leave little or no remaining assets in the
pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover
anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of the SUN Collateral may decline
over time. If the proceeds of the SUN Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Senior Notes,
the holders of the Senior Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the SUN Collateral)
would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the SUN Issuer’s and the Guarantors’
remaining assets.

The Senior Notes Indenture will also permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders
of the Senior Notes on the SUN Collateral. To the extent that holders of other indebtedness or third parties enjoy
liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Senior Notes Indenture or the Security
Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the SUN Collateral which,
if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Senior Notes. Moreover, if
we issue additional Senior Notes under the Senior Notes Indenture, holders of such Senior Notes would benefit
from the same collateral as the holders of the Senior Notes being offered hereby, thereby diluting your ability to
benefit from the liens on the SUN Collateral.

**Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes**

**_Not all of the Guarantors will initially guarantee the Notes._**

On the Issue Date, the Notes will only be guaranteed by the Issue Date Guarantors. We will agree in the
Indentures, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, to take such necessary actions so that the Post Closing
Guarantors become guarantors of the Notes by executing and delivering to the Trustee supplemental indentures
substantially in the forms attached to the Indentures within 150 days from (and excluding) the Acquisition
Closing Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and substantially simultaneously with the guarantees

76


-----

granted in favor of obligations under the Senior Facilities. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2020, on a
consolidated basis and excluding statistical corporate cost allocations, the Post-Closing Guarantors generated
62.8% of the Group’s consolidated EBITDA and 44.5% of the Group’s consolidated sales. As of March 31, 2020,
on a consolidated basis and excluding the value of the “thyssenkrupp” brand (the license for which will
automatically terminate 18 months after the Acquisition Closing Date), the Post-Closing Guarantors accounted
for 36.4% of the Group’s consolidated assets. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in procuring
such additional Note Guarantees within the time period specified. The Issue Date Note Guarantees by the Issue
Date Guarantors and Post-Closing Guarantees by the Post Closing Guarantors will be limited as set forth in
“Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note
_Guarantees and Security Interests.”_

**_The granting of the Note Guarantees and security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or_**
**_the incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening or voidance periods for such_**
**_security interests in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions._**

The granting of the Note Guarantees and security interests to secure the Notes may create hardening or voidance
periods for such Note Guarantees and security interests in certain jurisdictions. The granting of shared security
interests to secure future permitted debt may restart or reopen such hardening or voidance periods in particular,
as the Indentures will permit the release and retaking of security granted in favor of the Notes in certain
circumstances including in connection with the incurrence of future debt. The applicable hardening or voidance
period for these new security interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been granted or
perfected. At each time, if the security interest granted or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the
respective hardening or voidance period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective
and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the
_Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests.”_

The same rights also apply following the issuance of the Notes in connection with the accession of further
subsidiaries as additional guarantors and the granting of security interest over their relevant assets and equity
interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes, as applicable.

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes or under the Note Guarantees thereof or the Collateral across_**
**_multiple jurisdictions may prove difficult._**

The EUR SSN Issuer and the SUN Issuer are organized under the laws of Germany and the USD SSN Issuer is
organized under the laws of Delaware; the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Canada, Germany, the
Netherlands and the United States; and the Collateral includes the shares of certain of our subsidiaries
incorporated under the laws of those jurisdictions, and certain present and future intercompany loan receivables
held by the Issuers and certain of their subsidiaries in respect of debtors in certain of these jurisdictions. In the
event of bankruptcy, insolvency, administration or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these
jurisdictions. Your rights under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral are likely to be subject to
insolvency and administrative laws of several jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that you will be able to
effectively enforce your rights in such complex proceedings. In addition, the multi-jurisdictional nature of
enforcement over the Collateral may limit the realizable value of the Collateral.

The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdiction of organization of the Issuers and the
Guarantors may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and with the laws of the United States,
including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain
post-petition interest, the duration of proceeding and preference periods. The application of these laws, and any
conflict between them, could call into question whether, and to what extent, the laws of any particular
jurisdiction should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Note Guarantees and the
Security Documents in these jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive.

**_The Escrow Charges will be granted to the Trustee and the security interests in the remaining Collateral will_**
**_be granted to the Security Agent, in each case, rather than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of_**
**_the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable, to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by local law._**

The security interests that will secure the obligations of each Issuer under the Notes and the obligations of the
Guarantors under the Note Guarantees thereof will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but to the
respective Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, and thus the holders of the Notes will not have any
independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Security Documents or to exercise any rights or
powers arising under the Security Documents except through the relevant Trustee or Security Agent, as

77


-----

applicable, including as may be provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting a Note, you will be
deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have
limited remedies and recourse against us in the event of a default. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests in the Collateral (excluding the
Escrow Charges) is subject to mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests
over such Collateral are taken. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for the appropriation
of certain pledged assets, but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply.
There is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of
the Notes that are not identified as registered holders in a security document will be validly secured. In certain
jurisdictions, including Germany, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection
of security interests and the enforceability of such security interests, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for
the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the relevant Security Agent (“Parallel Debt”) mirroring the
obligations of each Issuer and the Guarantors owed to holders of the Notes under or in connection with the
Indentures (“Principal Obligations”). All or part of the pledges and other security interests in such jurisdictions
will be granted to the Security Agent as security interests for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the
Principal Obligations. Under the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Parallel Debt will be at all times
in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations and any payment in respect of the
Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel
Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the security interests granted to secure
the Parallel Debt, the holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take
enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the relevant Security Agent. Therefore,
the holders of the Notes will bear the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of the relevant Security Agent. In addition,
the Parallel Debt construct has not been tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions and to the extent that the
security interests in the Collateral created under the Parallel Debt construct are not validly granted, are
unenforceable or are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds
from an enforcement of such security interests in the Collateral. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations
_and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests.”_

**_Rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly perfected,
and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party or the grantor of the security, as
applicable. The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the
Notes if we fail or are unable to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens. Under German law, the
creation of a valid security interest under a German law governed pledge agreement in relation to certain assets
(such as bank accounts) may be subject to the delivery of a notice of pledge by the security agent or the security
provider to a third-party (for example, the notice of pledge to the account bank in case of a pledge over bank
accounts). Any failure to perfect any security interest in the Collateral may result in the invalidity of the relevant
security interest or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties,
including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Collateral. Neither
the Trustee nor the Security Agent will be under any obligation or responsibility to take any steps or action to
perfect, or ensure the perfection of, any such liens.

**_There are circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral_**
**_securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be released automatically without your consent or the_**
**_Trustee or the Security Agent obtaining your further consent._**

Under a variety of circumstances, the Collateral securing the Notes will be released automatically, including a
sale, transfer or other disposal of such Collateral in a transaction that does not violate the asset sale covenant of
the Indentures and in connection with an enforcement sale permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement. The
Indentures will also permit us to designate one or more restricted subsidiaries that are Guarantors as unrestricted
subsidiaries. If we designate a Guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the Indentures, all of the
liens on the Collateral owned by such subsidiary and any Note Guarantees by such subsidiary will be released
under the Indentures, subject to certain conditions. Designation of an unrestricted subsidiary as such will reduce
the aggregate value of the Collateral securing the Notes to the extent of liens securing the shares of such
unrestricted subsidiary or of its subsidiaries.

78


-----

Under various circumstances, the Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be released, including pursuant to the
provisions described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—IPO Debt Pushdown” and “Description of
_the Senior Notes—IPO Debt Pushdown.”_

Furthermore, under German law a secured party is, upon request by the relevant security grantor, obligated to
release security if the realizable value of the security is significantly higher than the value of the obligations
secured by such security.

Finally, if the secured obligations are exchanged, novated or terminated, a pledge or other accessory security
interest created pursuant to a security document governed by German law might be released as a matter of
German law.

**_The insolvency laws of Germany and other applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable to you as the_**
**_insolvency laws of the United States or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other_**
**_limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests (as defined herein), including fraudulent_**
**_conveyance statutes, may adversely affect their validity and enforceability._**

On and after the Issue Date or the Acquisition Closing Date, as applicable, our obligations under the relevant
Notes will be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantors and secured by security interests over the relevant Collateral
(the “Security Interests”). The EUR SSN Issuer and the SUN Issuer are organized under the laws of Germany;
the USD SSN Issuer is organized under the laws of Delaware; and the Guarantors are organized under the laws of
Canada, Germany, the Netherlands and the United States. With respect to the EUR SSN Issuer, the SUN Issuer
and any Guarantor organized under the laws of a member state of the European Union, there is a rebuttable
presumption that the “centre of main interest” as defined in the Council of the European Union Regulation
No. 2015/848 on Insolvency Proceedings is the jurisdiction where the registered office is situated. In addition,
the Collateral will include a pledge over the shares in certain of the Group’s subsidiaries incorporated under the
laws of Canada, Germany, the Netherlands and the United States and security interests in certain present and
future intercompany loan receivables held by the Issuers and certain of the Group’s subsidiaries incorporated
under the laws of Canada, Germany, the Netherlands and the United States.

The insolvency laws of foreign jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws of the United
States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar. In the event that any one or more of the Issuers, the
Guarantors or any other of the Issuers’ subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict
with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or
the outcome of such proceedings.

Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and
equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in
such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes against the Issuers, the enforceability of a Note
Guarantee against a Guarantor and the enforceability of the Security Interests. In certain circumstances the court
may also void the Security Interest or the Note Guarantee if the company is close to or near insolvency. The
following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes
generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer
and insolvency statutes.

In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed insolvency
administrator may challenge the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests, and intercompany obligations
generally, as preferences, transaction at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on
other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to:

- avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Note Guarantee or the Security
Interests provided by such security provider;

- direct that the Issuers and the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Note Guarantee or any
Security Interest to the relevant Guarantor or security provider or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s
or security provider’s creditors; and

- take other action that is detrimental to you.

If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Note Guarantee or Security Interest is found to be a
preference, transaction at an undervalue, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot
assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the liability of
each Guarantor or security provider under its Note Guarantee or the Security Interests will be limited to the
amount that will result in such guarantee or Security Interests not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or

79


-----

improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. The amount recoverable from the Guarantors and
security providers under the Security Documents will also be limited. However, there can be no assurance as to
what standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each. There is also the
possibility that the entire Note Guarantee or Security Interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability
may be extinguished. See also “—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other
_limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the_
_Note Guarantees and the Collateral.”_

In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts would, for
example, need to find that, at the time the Note Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests created, the
Guarantor or security provider:

- issued such Note Guarantee or created such Security Interest with the intent of hindering, delaying or
defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or created such
security after its insolvency;

- issued such Note Guarantee or created such Security Interest in a situation where a prudent business person
as a shareholder of such Guarantor or security provider would have contributed equity to such Guarantor or
security provider or where the relevant beneficiary of the Note Guarantee or Security Interest knew or
should have known that the Guarantor or security provider was insolvent or a filing for insolvency had been
made; or

- received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Note Guarantee or
Security Interest on the basis that the Note Guarantee or Security Interest were incurred for our benefit, and
only indirectly the Guarantor’s or security provider’s benefit, or on some other basis and (i) was insolvent or
rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Note Guarantee or the creation of the Security Interest,
or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons; (ii) was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business
transaction for which the Guarantor’s or security provider’s assets were unreasonably small; or (iii) intended
to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as and when they
would become due.

Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor or security provider generally
may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Note Guarantee or created any
Security Interest if:

- its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets;

- it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due;

- the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts and
liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute; or

- its liabilities exceed the liquidation value of its assets, unless it has a positive going concern prognosis.

Although we believe that both the Issuers and the Group are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the
Transactions, there can be no assurance as to which standard a court would apply in determining whether a
Guarantor or security provider was “insolvent” as of the date the Note Guarantees were issued or the Security
Interests were created or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor
or security provider was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not
a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on the date its Note Guarantee was issued or the Security Interests
were created, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

For an overview of certain insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the Note Guarantees and
Security Interests, see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests.”_

**_Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Note_**
**_Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and_**
**_the Collateral._**

Certain of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Canada, Germany, the Netherlands and the United
States. Enforcement of the obligations under a Note Guarantee against, and/or any Collateral provided by, as
applicable, any such Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available to the Issuers or the relevant
Guarantor, as the case may be. These laws and defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance,
financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or similar laws as well as

80


-----

regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally, particularly by limiting the amounts
recoverable under the Note Guarantees and Collateral, as applicable, and the amounts recoverable thereunder will
be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured by a particular Guarantor or security
provider under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Note Guarantee or
Collateral is not in the relevant Guarantor’s or security provider’s corporate interests, or the burden of such Note
Guarantee or Collateral exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor or security provider, or such Note
Guarantee or Collateral would be in breach of capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or thin capitalization
rules or any other general statutory laws and/or would cause the directors of such subsidiary Guarantor or
security provider to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability.

In relation to public limited liability companies (Aktiengesellschaften, “AG”) strict German capital maintenance
rules as set out in the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz, “AktG”) apply. Guarantees and/or security
interests provided by an AG and/or its direct or indirect subsidiaries in order to guarantee or secure liabilities of
any direct or indirect parent or affiliate company (such as the Issuers) are, unless a specific exception applies,
considered disbursements violating German capital maintenance law. Furthermore, the granting of guarantees
and/or security interests by an AG or its direct or indirect subsidiaries which serve the purpose of supporting the
financing of the acquisition of shares in such AG (financial assistance) is prohibited and, therefore, invalid.

Investors should note that the Target is incorporated in Germany in the form of an AG. All of the Post-Closing
Guarantors, which are expected to provide a Guarantee and certain Collateral under the Notes after the
Acquisition Closing Date, are subsidiaries of the Target and would therefore be subject to the limitations set out
above. Following the consummation of the Acquisition, it is expected that the legal form of the Target will be
changed from an Aktiengesellschaft to a Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung.

Further, the Note Guarantees and/or security interests granted by a German limited liability company
(Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung, “GmbH”) or a partnership with a GmbH as liable partner (i.e., a
GmbH & Co. KG) for the purpose of guaranteeing or securing liabilities of its direct or indirect shareholders or a
subsidiary of such shareholders (excluding direct or indirect subsidiaries of such GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG) are
considered to constitute a benefit for such shareholder and therefore are subject to certain capital maintenance
and liquidity maintenance rules. Therefore, any Note Guarantees and/or Collateral provided by a GmbH,
including by the EUR SSN Issuer, Newco and Bidco, will be subject to certain contractual limitations (so called
“limitation language”) contained in the respective Indentures (or any other document under which any Note
Guarantee is granted) and that are or will be contained in the Security Documents, respectively, designed to
ensure compliance with applicable capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or any other general statutory
laws. Certain of the Collateral is granted by the EUR SSN Issuer, Newco and Bidco and will be subject to
“limitation language.”

Any guarantee and/or security interest granted by a GmbH may be held invalid pursuant to Section 138 BGB and
would therefore not be enforceable if, at the time of the creation or enforcement of any such guarantee and/or
security interest, among others, the third party creditor and the affiliate have acted in fraudulent conveyance
(kollusives Zusammenwirken) to the detriment of the GmbH or other third party creditors of the GmbH. These
principles apply mutatis mutandis to a GmbH & Co. KG.

As a result, the Guarantor’s or security provider’s liability under its Note Guarantee or Collateral could be
materially reduced or eliminated, depending upon the law and contractual enforcement restrictions applicable to
it. This could lead to a situation in which such Note Guarantee or Collateral cannot be enforced at all. It is
possible that a Guarantor or security provider, or any of their creditors, or the bankruptcy trustee or other
insolvency office holder in the case of a bankruptcy/insolvency of a Guarantor or security provider, may contest
the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor’s Note Guarantee or the security provider’s Collateral on any of
the above grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Note Guarantee or Collateral should be
limited or voided. To the extent that any limitations on the relevant Note Guarantees or Collateral apply, the
Notes would be to that extent effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor or security
provider, including trade payables of such Guarantor or security provider. Future Note Guarantees and Collateral
may be subject to similar limitations.

See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note
_Guarantees and Security Interests.”_

**_Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes._**

Because the Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been, and will not be, and are not required to be, registered
under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, they may not be offered or sold in

81


-----

the United States except to QIBs in accordance with Rule 144A, to non U.S. persons in offshore transactions in
accordance with Regulation S or pursuant to another exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the
registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and all other applicable laws. These restrictions may limit the
ability of investors to resell the Notes. It is the obligation of investors in the Notes to ensure that all offers and
sales of the Notes in the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities laws. See “Transfer
_Restrictions.”_

**_The Notes will initially be held in book entry form and therefore investors must rely on the procedures of the_**
**_relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable.

Interests in the global Notes will trade in book entry form only, and Notes in definitive registered form, or
Definitive Registered Notes (as defined herein), will be issued in exchange for book entry interests only in very
limited circumstances. Owners of book entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of Notes. The
custodian for DTC or common depositary, or its nominee, for Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, will
be the registered holders of the global notes representing the Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other
amounts owing on or in respect of the global notes representing the Notes will be made to the applicable Paying
Agent, which will make payments to DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable. Thereafter, these
payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold book entry interests in the global Notes representing
the Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the custodian for DTC or
the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, the Issuers, the Trustee, the Paying Agents,
the Transfer Agents and the Registrars will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest,
principal or other amounts to the owners of book entry interests. Accordingly, if investors own a book entry
interest, they must rely on the procedures of DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, and if investors
are not participants in DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, they must rely on the procedures of
the participant through which they own their interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the
Notes under the Indentures.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book entry interests will not have the direct right to act
upon the Issuers’ solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes.
Instead, if an investor owns a book entry interest, it will be permitted to act only to the extent it has received
appropriate proxies to do so from DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable. The procedures
implemented for the granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable such investor to vote on a timely
basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indentures, unless and until Definitive Registered
Notes are issued in respect of all book entry interests, if investors own book entry interests, they will be restricted
to acting through DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable. The procedures to be implemented
through DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream may not be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under
the Notes. See “Book Entry, Delivery and Form.”

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes will be_**
**_limited._**

We cannot assure you as to:

- the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

- your ability to sell your Notes; or

- the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices of the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest
rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes
may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for
non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the
prices of securities similar to the Notes. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of
Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. The Initial Purchasers have advised that they
intend to make a market in the Notes after completing the Offering. However, they have no obligation to do so
and may discontinue market making activities at any time without notice. In addition, such market making
activity will be subject to limitations imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and other applicable laws and
regulations. As a result, there may not be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market
develops, you may not be able to resell your Notes at a fair value, if at all.

**_The Notes and the Note Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the claims of creditors, including_**
**_depositors, trade creditors and preferred stockholders (if any), of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries._**

Generally, claims of creditors, including depositors, trade creditors and preferred stockholders (if any) of
non-Guarantor subsidiaries of the Issuers, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such
subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to their respective parent entity or the creditors
of the Issuers and the Guarantors. Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor subsidiary of the Issuers
becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a
solvent transaction:

- the creditors of the Issuers and the Guarantors (including the holders of the Notes) will have no right to
proceed against the assets of such non-Guarantor subsidiary; and

- creditors of such non-Guarantor subsidiary, including depositors, trade creditors and preferred stockholders
(if any) will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such
subsidiary before the Issuers or any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder (as applicable), will be
entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary.

As such, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the creditors, including
depositors, trade creditors and any preferred stockholders (if any) of the non-Guarantor subsidiaries of the
Issuers. In addition, the Indentures will, subject to certain limitations, permit these non-Guarantor subsidiaries to
incur substantial additional indebtedness without such incurrence constituting a default under the Indentures, and
such indebtedness may also be secured. The Indentures will not contain any limitation on the amount of other
liabilities, such as deposits and trade payables, that may be incurred by these subsidiaries.

**_Investors may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The EUR SSN Issuer, the SUN Issuer and the Guarantors (other than thyssenkrupp Elevator Manufacturing Inc.
and thyssenkrupp Elevator Corp.) (together, the “Non-U.S. Obligors”) are organized or incorporated outside the
United States, and their business is substantially conducted outside the United States. The directors and executive
officers of the Non-U.S. Obligors are non-residents of, and substantially all of their assets are located outside of,
the United States. Although the Non-U.S. Obligors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in
connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the
United States on the directors and executive officers of Non-U.S. Obligors. In addition, as a substantial portion of
the assets of the Non-U.S. Obligors and their subsidiaries and those of their directors and executive officers are
located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce against them judgments obtained in U.S.
courts. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Non-U.S. Obligors may
not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States.

Additionally, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of foreign jurisdictions would enforce (i) judgments of
United States courts obtained against the Non-U.S. Obligors and the directors and executive officers who are not
residents of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the United States federal and state
securities laws or (ii) in original actions brought in such foreign jurisdictions against us or such persons
predicated upon the United States federal and state securities laws.

The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of
judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters, with Germany and the
Netherlands. For further information see “Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.”

**_The Issuers may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. In addition, under certain_**
**_circumstances, the Issuers may have the right to purchase all outstanding Notes in connection with a tender_**
**_offer, even if certain holders do not consent to the tender._**

If a change of control (as defined in the respective Indenture) occurs, the Issuers will be required to make an
offer to purchase all the outstanding respective Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof,
plus any accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase. In
such a situation, the Issuers may not have enough funds to pay for all of the Notes that are tendered under any
such offer. If a significant principal amount of Notes is tendered, the Issuers will likely have to obtain financing
to pay for the tendered Notes. However, the Issuers may not be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms,
if at all. A change of control may also result in a mandatory prepayment under the Senior Facilities Agreement
and agreements governing any future indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of such indebtedness. Any
failure by the Issuers to offer to purchase the Notes upon a change of control would constitute a default under the
Indentures, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Senior Facilities Agreement.

83


-----

The change of control provision contained in the Indentures may not necessarily afford you protection in the
event of certain important corporate events, including reorganizations, restructurings, mergers, recapitalizations
or other similar transactions involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not
involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a change of control
as defined in the Indentures.

In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control will be deemed
not to be a change of control, provided that upon consummation thereof, a certain consolidated net leverage ratio
of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries is met.

In addition, in connection with certain tender offers for the Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate
principal amount of the applicable outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such
tender offer and the relevant Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of such Issuer,
purchases, all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the relevant Issuer or such third
party will have the right to redeem the Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such
purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other holder of Notes. See “Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes—Optional Redemption” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Optional Redemption.”_

**_The term “all or substantially all” in the context of a change of control has no clearly established meaning_**
**_under relevant law and is subject to judicial interpretation such that it may not be certain that a change of_**
**_control has occurred or will occur._**

Upon the occurrence of a transaction that constitutes a change of control under the respective Indenture, the
relevant Issuer will be required to make an offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes tendered. The definition of
“change of control” in the Indentures will include (with certain exceptions) a disposition of all or substantially all
of the assets of the relevant Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries (taken as a whole), to any person. Although there
is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” it has no clearly established
meaning under relevant law, varies according to the facts and circumstances of the subject transaction and is
subject to judicial interpretation. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty in
ascertaining whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets
of a person, and therefore it may be unclear whether a change of control has occurred and whether the relevant
Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_We may dispose of certain assets or capital stock of entities in the Group._**

We may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings, or other transactions that, in our
judgment, would be beneficial to us, even if such transactions might involve risks to you as noteholders. For
example, pursuant to the “specified asset disposition” covenant and other provisions of the Senior Facilities
Agreement and the Indentures, we may, under certain circumstances, sell, convey, transfer or otherwise dispose
of material assets of the Group and, if meeting certain leverage ratios on a pro forma basis, distribute some or all
of the proceeds therefrom to our shareholders. Such a transaction would not constitute a change of control or a
default under the terms of the Notes. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Restricted Payments”, “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Definitions—Permitted_
_Specified Asset Disposition”, “Description of the Senior Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted_
_Payments” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Certain Definitions—Permitted Specified Asset Disposition”._
Additionally, we may issue, sell transfer or otherwise dispose of the capital stock of entities in the Group for
purposes of taking a dividend or distribution that would benefit us but not benefit you as a noteholders.

**_Holders of the Notes may have adverse tax consequences in the event of an IPO Debt Pushdown._**

Under certain circumstances, we may undertake an IPO Debt Pushdown (as described in “Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes—IPO Debt Pushdown” and in “Description of the Senior Notes—IPO Debt Pushdown”),_
pursuant to which the Issuers are entitled to give notice that the terms of the Indentures and the Intercreditor
Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined in “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Certain_
_Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements”)) will automatically operate so that, among other things, the_
references to such Issuer and Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Certain Definitions” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Certain Definitions”) (and all related provisions)_
shall apply only to the IPO Pushdown Entity (as defined in “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—IPO Debt
_Pushdown” and in “Description of the Senior Notes—IPO Debt Pushdown”) and its Restricted Subsidiaries. In_
such event, each holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity would be released from its obligations under the
applicable Indenture.

84


-----

In either case, such modifications to the terms of the Notes could be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as
a deemed exchange of (i) the Notes as in place prior to such modifications for (ii) new Notes as in place after such
modifications (the “New Notes”). If such modifications result in a deemed exchange for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, it would generally be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes in which
beneficial owners of the Notes would be required to recognize any gain or loss. Furthermore, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, the New Notes deemed issued in such a deemed exchange could be treated as issued with
original issue discount. In such event, U.S. Holders (as defined under “Certain Tax Consequences—Certain U.S.
_Federal Income Tax Considerations”) would be required to include the original issue discount in their income as it_
accrues, in advance of the receipt of cash corresponding to such income. In addition, the determination of whether
the New Notes are treated as “contingent payment debt instruments” as a result of the possibility of additional
payments, as further described under “Certain Tax Consequences—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax
_Considerations—Additional Payments,” would be made at the time of the modification. U.S. Holders should consult_
their own tax advisors as to the U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to potential modifications of the
Notes in connection with the IPO Debt Pushdown.

It is also possible that the IPO Debt Pushdown could result in a taxable event for tax purposes other than U.S.
federal income tax purposes.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject_**
**_to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The credit ratings address
our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in determining the likelihood
that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all
risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that may affect the
value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to
revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurances can be given that a credit
rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn
entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension,
reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating
agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the
value and trading of the Notes.

**_Certain covenants and events of default will be suspended if we receive investment grade ratings._**

Each of the Indentures will provide that, if at any time following the date of each Indenture, the Notes issued
under such Indenture receive an investment grade rating of Baa3 or better by Moody’s and BBB or better by
S&P, and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day and continuing
until such time as such Notes are no longer rated investment grade by either ratings agency, certain covenants
will cease to be applicable to such Notes. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—
_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status” and “Description of the Senior Notes—_
_Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status.” At any time when_
these covenants are suspended, we will be able to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, pay cash
dividends and redeem subordinated indebtedness without restriction, each of which may conflict with the
interests of holders of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve an investment grade
rating or that any such rating if achieved will be maintained.

**_The Notes may not become or remain listed on the Exchange._**

Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited for the listing of and
permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange. However, there can be no assurance that the
Notes will become or remain listed. If the Issuers cannot maintain the listing on the Exchange and the admission
to dealing on the Official List thereof, or if it becomes unduly burdensome to make or maintain such listing, the
Issuers may cease to make or maintain such listing on the Official List of the Exchange. Listing of any of the
Notes on the Exchange does not imply that a public offering of any of the Notes in the Channel Islands or the Isle
of Man has been authorized. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of listing
on the Official List of the Exchange or another recognized listing exchange for comparable issuers, failure to be
approved for listing of the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange or another recognized listing exchange or
the delisting of the Notes from the Official List of the Exchange or another listing exchange may have an adverse
effect on a holder’s ability to resell Notes in the secondary market.

85


-----

**_You may face foreign currency exchange as a result of investing in the Notes._**

The EUR Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If you are a U.S. investor, an investment in the EUR
Notes will entail foreign exchange related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the
value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar because of economic, political and other factors over which we have
no control. Depreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the
EUR Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to you on a U.S. dollar basis.

**_The Indentures will not be qualified under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended._**

The Indentures will not be required to, and will not be, qualified under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as
amended (the “TIA”) and will not incorporate or include and will not be subject to any of the provisions of the
TIA. Consequently, the holders of Notes will not be entitled to the protections provided under the TIA to holders
of debt securities issued under a qualified indenture, including those respecting preferential collections by the
trustee or conflicting interests of the trustee. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” and “Description of
_the Senior Notes.”_

**THE TRANSACTIONS**

**_The Acquisition_**

On February 26/27, 2020, Bidco, an entity indirectly owned by Advent and the Cinven Funds, entered into the
Share Purchase Agreement to acquire from the Seller all of the issued and outstanding share capital of the Target.
We currently expect the Acquisition to complete during the course of July 2020. The consummation of the
Acquisition is, however, subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including customary antitrust
and regulatory approvals and the performance of certain closing actions. Under the terms of the Share Purchase
Agreement, Bidco has agreed to take all necessary steps to obtain the required clearances following the signing
of the Share Purchase Agreement. If closing has not occurred on the date falling six months after the signing date
of the Share Purchase Agreement, the Share Purchase Agreement may be terminated.

Please see “Use of Proceeds” for the estimated sources and uses necessary to consummate the Acquisition.

Under the Share Purchase Agreement, intercompany financing arrangements will be terminated prior to the
Acquisition Closing Date. In general, intercompany receivables owed to thyssenkrupp AG by the Target will
need to be acquired by the purchaser, subject to an additional purchase price, and all intercompany payables
owed by thyssenkrupp AG to the Target will be paid in cash to the Target on the Acquisition Closing Date. In
addition, the Share Purchase Agreement provides for a netting mechanism, pursuant to which, as of the
Acquisition Closing Date, there will be no intercompany receivables owed to thyssenkrupp AG by the Target that
need to be acquired and, instead, only intercompany payables owed by thyssenkrupp AG to the Target (if any)
will remain outstanding. Such intercompany payables will then be off-set against the purchase price for the
Acquisition.

The Share Purchase Agreement contains customary warranties given by the Seller as to capacity, title and certain
business matters as well as customary signing to closing covenants given by the Seller regarding, among other
things, the conduct of the business and the affairs of the Group pending closing of the Acquisition. The Seller’s
liability for any breach of a warranty is subject to certain thresholds and limitations. In addition, pursuant to the
Share Purchase Agreement, the Seller has agreed to take certain actions to facilitate the ability of the Group to
operate on a standalone basis, including, subject to certain exceptions, the provision of a number of services
pursuant to the New TSAs and the Additional Service Agreements, including relating to accounting and risk
services, IT, procurement, real estate, human resources, compliance, tax (in certain jurisdictions) and others, to
the Group, following the Acquisition. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Ongoing
_Relationships and Services Provided by the thyssenkrupp Group—Services provided by the thyssenkrupp Group_
_to the Group—Transitional Service Agreements (“TSAs”).”_

Further, subject to certain customary exceptions and excluding the reinvestment by thyssenkrupp AG in the
Group, the Seller has agreed that, for two years from the Acquisition Closing Date, neither it nor its subsidiaries
will, without Bidco’s written consent, engage in the territory in which the Group will conduct business as of the
Acquisition Closing Date, directly or indirectly, in the field of elevator business activities of the Group,
comprising the installation, modernization, servicing or maintenance of elevators, escalators, stair-lifts, moving
walks or passenger boarding bridges (as well as directly related ancillary activities, such as manufacturing and
designing of elevators, escalators, stair-lifts, moving walks or passenger boarding bridges).

Following the completion of the Acquisition, Bidco will hold 100% of the shares in the Target and we expect the
legal form of the Target will be changed from an Aktiengesellschaft to a Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung
shortly after closing.

Prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, Bidco will not have control over the board of directors of thyssenkrupp
Elevator. The board of directors of thyssenkrupp Elevator will be required, prior to the Acquisition Closing Date,
to manage thyssenkrupp Elevator under its own responsibility and in a manner that is in the best interests of
thyssenkrupp Elevator. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—The Issuers do not currently
_control the Target and will not control the Target until the Acquisition Closing Date.”_

**_Escrow Accounts_**

Pending the consummation of the Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers will deposit the gross proceeds from the
Offering of the Notes into the Escrow Accounts in the names of the Issuers. The Escrow Accounts will be
controlled by the Escrow Agent and will be pledged on a first-priority basis in favor of the Trustee on behalf of
the holders of the respective series of the Notes. See “Summary—The Offering—Collateral.”

The release of the Escrowed Property from the Escrow Accounts is subject to the satisfaction of certain
conditions, including that the funds required to pay the consideration for the Acquisition will be applied promptly
(and in any event within two business days). See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Escrow of Proceeds;
_Special Mandatory Redemption” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory_
_Redemption.” If these conditions are not satisfied on or before the Escrow Longstop Date or upon the occurrence_
of certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption. The special mandatory
redemption price for the Notes will be equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price of the Notes plus accrued and
unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of such special mandatory redemption.
See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,”
“Description of the Senior Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” and “Risk Factors—
_Risks Relating to the Transactions—If the conditions precedent to the release of the Escrowed Property are not_
_satisfied, the Issuers will be required to redeem the Notes, but the Escrow Accounts may not have sufficient funds_
_to cover such redemption without relying on the Escrow Equity Commitment.”_

In the event of a special mandatory redemption, the SUN Issuer, in the case of the Senior Secured Notes, and
Vertical Topco III, in the case of the Senior Notes, will be required to fund the relevant Issuer in such aggregate
amounts as are required in order to enable the Issuers to pay any funding shortfall, including Escrow Account
fees, negative interest on the Escrow Accounts’ balances and costs and accrued and unpaid interest and additional
amounts, if any, owing to the holders of the Notes on such special mandatory redemption date (the “Escrow
Equity Commitment”), pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter. The holders of the Notes will not have any
direct right to enforce the Escrow Equity Commitment, and must rely on the Issuers’ respective rights to
enforcement under the Escrow Equity Commitment. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Escrow of
_Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,” “Description of the Senior Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special_
_Mandatory Redemption” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—If the conditions precedent to_
_the release of the Escrowed Property are not satisfied, the Issuers will be required to redeem the Notes, but the_
_Escrow Accounts may not have sufficient funds to cover such redemption without relying on the Escrow Equity_
_Commitment.”_

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We estimate that the gross proceeds from the Offering will be €4,050 million (equivalent). The proceeds from the
Offering of the Notes, together with borrowings under the Senior Term Facilities, the proceeds from the Private
Senior Notes and the Equity Contribution will be used to (i) fund the consideration payable for the Acquisition
and (ii) pay the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions.

The estimated sources and uses necessary to consummate the Transactions are shown in the table below. Actual
amounts will vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including the actual Acquisition
Closing Date, and the actual purchase price for the Acquisition, fluctuations in currency exchange rates for
amounts not denominated in euro, the amount of the Equity Contribution or other sources made available and
differences between estimated and actual fees and expenses. In particular, the purchase price under the Share
Purchase Agreement as shown below reflects the agreed base consideration as adjusted for our estimates of an
agreed ticker fee accruing until the Acquisition Closing Date and certain notified cash leakage items, estimates of
the amount of various other liabilities transferred in connection with the sale (including pensions and leases),
certain payments arising as a result of the Transactions and certain other adjustments required under the Share
Purchase Agreement. This amount is expected to change depending on the timing of the Acquisition Closing
Date and a number of other factors.

The table below should be read in conjunction with “Description of the Senior Secured Notes,” “Description of
_the Senior Notes” and “Capitalization.”_

(1) Represents the euro-equivalent of the aggregate principal amount we expect to draw under the Senior Term Facilities on or about the
Acquisition Closing Date. The commitment in respect of the USD TLA Facility and USD TLB Facility is denominated in euros and will
be redenominated into U.S. dollars on or about the Acquisition Closing Date.

(2) Represents the euro-equivalent of the estimated gross proceeds of €1,750 million in aggregate principal amount of SSN EUR Notes and
€1,250 million (USD equivalent) in aggregate principal amount of SSN USD Notes.

(3) Represents the euro-equivalent of the estimated gross proceeds of €650 million in aggregate principal amount of SUN EUR Notes and
€400 million (USD equivalent) in aggregate principal amount of SUN USD Notes.

(4) Represents the euro-equivalent of the amount of gross proceeds of the Private Senior Notes which consist of a euro-denominated tranche
and a U.S. dollar-denominated tranche. The commitment in respect of the U.S. dollar-denominated tranche is denominated in euros and
will be redenominated into U.S. dollars on or about the Acquisition Closing Date.

(5) Represents the expected equity contributions (based on the agreed base consideration pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement) from
the Sponsors, thyssenkrupp AG, other co-investors and management, including the proceeds of the PIK Notes, in each case, in the form
of equity and subordinated shareholder funding. The amount of the equity contributions from the Sponsors and certain of its co-investors
may be increased or decreased if the fees and expenses are greater or less than our current estimate or as a result of purchase price
adjustments under the Share Purchase Agreement.

(6) Represents the agreed base consideration payable to the Seller pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement as adjusted for our estimates of
an agreed ticker fee accruing until the Acquisition Closing Date and certain notified cash leakage items, estimates of the amount of
various other liabilities transferred in connection with the sale (including pensions and leases), certain payments arising as a result of the
Transactions and certain other adjustments required under the Share Purchase Agreement. The purchase price under the SPA is
calculated as the agreed base consideration plus the agreed ticker fee from the locked box dated (September 30, 2019) until the closing
date minus certain notified leakage and adjustments for various other liabilities transferred in connection with the sale (including
pensions and leases), certain payments arising as a result of the Transactions and certain other adjustments required under the Share
Purchase Agreement. The purchase price will be paid in cash at closing, other than the purchase price portion attributable to the
reinvestment of thyssenkrupp AG which will be settled in kind by granting thyssenkrupp AG a participation in .an indirect parent
company of the SUN Issuer. See “Summary—Summary Corporate and Financing Structure.”

(7) Represents estimated fees and expenses associated with the Transactions, including net interest expense that will accrue on proceeds of
the Notes deposited into escrow, underwriting, financial advisory, legal, accounting, ratings advisory and other transaction costs and
professional fees.

(8) Represents the minimum amount of operating cash of the Target Group expected as of the Acquisition Closing Date. Any cash in excess
of this amount in the Target Group as of the Acquisition Closing Date is expected (due to a related increase in the intercompany payables
owed by the Target Group to thyssenkrupp AG) to increase the purchase price and to be funded through the Revolving Credit Facility.

**CAPITALIZATION**

The following table sets forth the consolidated cash and cash equivalents and the consolidated capitalization of
(i) the Target as of March 31, 2020 on an actual basis and (ii) the SUN Issuer as of March 31, 2020 as adjusted to
give effect to the completion of the Transactions, including the application of the proceeds from the Offering as
described in, and subject to the assumptions of, “Use of Proceeds,” as if these events had occurred on March 31,
2020, unless otherwise described below. The adjustments are based on available information and contain
assumptions made by our management. Amounts of indebtedness shown in the following table represent
principal amounts and exclude lease liabilities and operational guarantees. Amounts committed or denominated
in currencies other than euro have been converted to euro at the applicable exchange rate as of,
2020.

(1) The as adjusted column represents the minimum amount of operating cash of the Target Group expected as of the Acquisition Closing
Date. Any cash in excess of this amount in the Target Group as of the Acquisition Closing Date is expected (due to a related increase in
the intercompany payables owed by the Target Group to thyssenkrupp AG) to increase the purchase price and to be funded through the
Revolving Credit Facility.

(2) Represents the aggregate principal amount expected to be drawn under the Senior Term Facilities on the Acquisition Closing Date,
including €1,000 million drawn under the EUR TLB Facility, €500 million (equivalent) drawn under the USD TLA Facility and
€2,050 million drawn under the USD TLB Facility (which will be redenominated into U.S. dollars on or about the Acquisition Closing
Date). The Guarantee Facility is expected to be made available in the amount of €1,000 million (equivalent), but is not reflected in the
table above, as it is not expected to be cash drawn as of the Acquisition Closing Date.

(3) Represents the Revolving Credit Facility, which is expected to be made available in the amount of €1,000 million (equivalent) under the
Senior Facilities Agreement, but excludes amounts which may be drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility to fund an increase in
purchase price due to an increase in the intercompany payables owed by the Target Group to thyssenkrupp AG as of the Acquisition
Closing Date.

(4) Represents the euro equivalent of €750 million aggregate principal amount of SSN EUR Fixed Notes, €1,000 million aggregate principal
amount of SSN EUR FRN Notes and €1,250 million (USD equivalent) aggregate principal amount of SSN USD Notes.

(5) Represents the euro equivalent of €650 million aggregate principal amount of SUN EUR Notes and €400 million (USD equivalent)
aggregate principal amount of SUN USD Notes.

(6) Represents principal amounts drawn under local facilities. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Local Credit
_Facilities.”_

(7) Excludes all of our lease liabilities in the amount of €330 million as of March 31, 2020.

(8) As adjusted total shareholders’ equity represents expected equity contributions (based on the agreed base consideration pursuant to the
Share Purchase Agreement) from the Sponsors, thyssenkrupp AG, other co-investors and management, including the proceeds of the PIK
Notes, in each case, in the form of equity and subordinated shareholder funding. The amount of the equity contributions from the
Sponsors and certain of its co-investors may be increased or decreased if the fees and expenses are greater or less than our current
estimate or as a result of purchase price adjustments under the Share Purchase Agreement.

**SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

_The following tables present our financial information and have been derived from, and should be read in_
_conjunction with, our Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Interim Consolidated_
_Financial Statements that have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and are included elsewhere herein and_
_the sections entitled “Presentation of Financial Information”, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of_
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalization”._

_We have extracted (i) the combined historical financial information of the Elevator Technology Business for the_
_2016/2017, 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 Financial Years from the Audited Combined Financial Statements and_
_(ii) the consolidated historical financial information of the Elevator Technology Business for the six months_
_ended March 31, 2019 and 2020 from the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements, in each case,_
_included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. As the Elevator Technology Business did not exist as a_
_separate group and since all companies and operating activities within the Elevator Technology Business were_
_under the common control of thyssenkrupp AG, in each case, prior to the Reorganization, the financial_
_information presented as of and for the financial years ended September 30, 2017, 2018 and 2019 has been_
_prepared on a combined basis. Effective with the Reorganization, the Elevator Technology Business came into_
_existence as a separate group and therefore, the financial information presented for the Target and its_
_consolidated subsidiaries as of and for the six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2020 was prepared on a_
_consolidated basis. There are important differences between the Elevator Technology Business as presented in_
_the Audited Combined Financials as of and for the 2016/2017, 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 Financial Years and_
_the business carried out by the Target and its subsidiaries as presented in the Unaudited Interim Consolidated_
_Financial Statements as of and for the six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2020. See “Presentation of_
_Financial Information—Basis of Preparation” and our Financial Statements included elsewhere herein._

_The independent auditor’s report on the Audited Combined Financial Statements is qualified due to issues_
_regarding local book keeping and financial reporting processes, which led to qualified, adverse or disclaimer of_
_opinions on the financial information of certain entities of the Elevator Technology Business’s Operating Unit_
_Spanish Latin America in several instances as of September 30, 2018 and 2017 and for the financial years ended_
_September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The auditor’s qualification does not pertain to the combined statement of_
_financial position as of September 30, 2019 included in the Audited Combined Financial Statements. In the_
_Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements, the issues relating to the Elevator Technology Business’s_
_Operating Unit Spanish Latin America described above still remained for the six-month period ended March 31,_
_2019. See “Presentation of Financial Information” and our Financial Statements included elsewhere herein._

**Overview**

We are one of the world’s leading providers of elevator and escalator technology, with top market positions in
the Americas, Europe and Africa and a strong platform to capture growth opportunities in the Asia Pacific region.
We design, manufacture, install, service and modernize state-of-the-art passenger and freight elevators,
escalators, moving walkways, passenger boarding bridges and chair and platform lifts, covering the entire
product life cycle from new installation to service and modernization. Building on our German engineering
heritage, we are an innovation leader in the digital age, leveraging Internet of Things technologies to collect data
and make recommendations for repairs in real time to better serve rapidly urbanizing societies with a focus on
product safety and efficiency. Operating from approximately 1,000 locations worldwide and serving customers in
more than 100 countries, our business is characterized by a global sales and service network to ensure optimum
proximity to clients. High-profile infrastructure projects such as One World Trade Center in New York, the
tallest building in the Americas, the Beijing International Airport T3 Terminal and the Federation Tower in
Russia have all featured our elevator and escalator products, illustrating our strengths and global reach. For the
twelve months ended March 31, 2020, our sales and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA were €8,048 million and
€1,323 million, respectively.

Our operations comprise three business lines:

- _New Installation:_ Our New Installation business covers the design, manufacture and installation of
elevators, escalators and moving walks for all major markets and industries, including for both commercial
and residential projects, and includes low-rise, mid-rise and high-rise solutions offered at different
customization levels. Our New Installation business contributed 45% of sales in the twelve months ended
March 31, 2020.

- _Service:_ Our Service business offers a broad range of maintenance services both for our own and thirdparty equipment, with a view to ensuring the continued safety, performance and efficiency of elevators,
escalators and moving walkways throughout their usable lives. Depending on the scope agreed in our
service contracts, our services range from basic oil and grease maintenance to bespoke full-service packages
that include the sale and installation of replacement parts. As of March 31, 2020, we had approximately
1.4 million units under maintenance. Our Service business contributed 43% of sales in the twelve months
ended March 31, 2020.

- _Modernization:_ Our Modernization business offers comprehensive solutions ranging from partial
modernization to complete replacement of existing elevator and escalator systems and other solutions, both
for our own and for third-party systems. Our Modernization business contributed 12% of sales in the twelve
months ended March 31, 2020.

Our life-cycle business model is built on our New Installation business, which serves as the entry to our Service
business. On average, we convert 70% to 80% of new elevator and escalator installations into ongoing Service
contracts. This provides a source of stable and recurring sales as we also succeeded in retaining more than 90%

94


-----

of our Service customers in each of our last three financial years. In addition, we win Service and Modernization
contracts from third parties where another manufacturer undertook the New Installation. The Service and
Modernization businesses, which together accounted for 54% of sales and around 70% of gross profit in the
2018/2019 Financial Year, are a source of stable, recurring sales and high profit margins for the Group, which
provides visibility on future earnings. Driven by our high conversion rate and high retention rates, we have been
able to maintain longstanding customer relationships. Given our global reach and high level of diversification,
our top ten customers in aggregate typically account for less than 3% of our annual revenue.

We have two core divisions and four operating segments, which are part of our reporting segments in accordance
with IFRS 8: Americas, Europe/Africa, Asia/Pacific and Access Solutions (together, our “Operating Segments”)
through which we conduct our customer-facing business activities. Our first core division is the new installation,
service and modernization of elevators, escalators and moving walks (the “Elevator and Escalator division”). Our
second core division is the new installation, service and modernization of access solutions for airports and homes
(the “Access Solutions division”).

The Elevator and Escalator division is divided into three Operating Segments based on geography, which enables
each to tailor its products to the specific customer needs and legal and regulatory requirements in its local markets:

- _Americas:_ Our Americas segment covers our Elevator and Escalator division’s activities in the Americas
and is sub-divided into two further regional units, including North America, covering the United States and
Canada, and Latin America, covering Brazil as the main Latin American sales area and Spanish Latin
America. Our Americas segment contributed €3,306 million, or 41%, of the Operating Segments’ total sales
and €489 million, or 51%, of the Operating Segments’ Adjusted EBIT in the 2018/2019 Financial Year.

- _Europe/Africa:_ Our Europe/Africa segment covers our Elevator and Escalator division’s activities in
Europe and Africa and operates within a widely diverse set of geographical areas through five operational
units: “DACH,” comprising Germany, Austria and Switzerland, “RET,” comprising Russia, Eastern Europe
and Turkey, “FRANCE,” comprising France and Monaco, “BBNI,” comprising the Benelux countries,
Britain, the Nordics and Italy and “IBA,” comprising Spain, Portugal, Angola and Morocco and, through
distributors, certain African countries. Our Europe/Africa segment contributed €2,149 million, or 26%, of
the Operating Segments’ total sales and €227 million, or 24%, of the Operating Segments’ Adjusted EBIT
in the 2018/2019 Financial Year.

- _Asia/Pacific:_ Our Asia/Pacific segment covers our Elevator and Escalator division’s activities in the Asia/
Pacific region and is organized in six operational units: China, South Korea, India, Australia/New Zealand,
Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Our Asia/Pacific segment contributed €2,307 million, or 28%, of the
Operating Segments’ total sales and €178 million, or 19%, of the Operating Segments’ Adjusted EBIT in
the 2018/2019 Financial Year.

Our Access Solutions division operates across all geographies and constitutes our fourth Operating Segment. It
employs a number of different sales strategies and distribution channels, catering to both the business-to-business
and business-to-consumer markets. The Access Solutions division accounted for 5% of the Operating Segments’
total sales and 6% of the Operating Segments’ Adjusted EBIT in the 2018/2019 Financial Year.

In accordance with IFRS 8, we report our results of operations in five segments:

- _Americas: Our Americas segment comprises all activities related to the new installation, service and_
modernization of elevators, escalators and moving walks (the “Elevator and Escalator division”) in countries
in North and South America.

- _Europe/Africa: Within our Europe/Africa segment, we report the results of our Elevator and Escalator_
division in countries in Europe and Africa.

- _Asia/Pacific: Within our Asia/Pacific segment, we report the results of our Elevator and Escalator division_
in countries in the Middle East and Asia, Australia and New Zealand.

- _Access Solutions: In addition to our core Elevator and Escalator division, we offer access solutions for_
airports (such as passenger boarding bridges, ground support equipment, visual docking guidance systems,
ancillary equipment products and maintenance services) and homes (such as chairlifts, platform lifts and
home elevators), the results of which are reported in our Access Solutions segment.

- _Corporate Elevator: Within the Corporate Elevator segment, we report the consolidated results of certain_
non-customer facing administrative services that support our operating activities, including services related
to our headquarters, financing, research and development, intellectual property and human resources.

The five reporting segments described above reflect our internal management reporting and are based on the
same accounting principles as the Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Interim
Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment results are reconciled to our Financial Statements taking into
account consolidation effects, which primarily relate to intercompany profits in inventories and the reversal of
intercompany interest income, and retrospective group allocations that represent a proportionate amount of
corporate costs and non-operational effects that were historically recorded at the parent company level without
being recharged to the Elevator Technology Business.

**Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations**

We believe that the factors discussed below have significantly affected our results of operations, financial
condition and cash flow in the historical periods for which financial information is presented in this offering
memorandum, and that these factors will continue to have a material influence on our results of operations,
financial condition and cash flow in the future.

**_Activity levels in the construction industry_**

Demand for our products and services is significantly influenced by activity levels and capital expenditures
within the residential and commercial construction industry, which is highly cyclical and sensitive to changes in
global economic conditions, GDP growth in the relevant markets, inflation, the interest rate environment and
conditions in the credit markets. Our New Installation business, in particular, is influenced by changes in the
global economic conditions, whereas our Service and Modernization businesses are more resilient and have
demonstrated strong and continuous revenue growth during periods of economic distress. Cyclicality in
economic conditions and activity levels in the construction industry may result in significant fluctuations in our
sales and profitability from period to period and over the business cycle, although there tends to be a time lag
between changes in activity levels in the construction industry and the resulting impact on our results of
operations, since elevators and escalators are often among the last items to be installed in new buildings.

A robust economic environment, particularly one marked by low interest rates and borrowing costs, typically
results in strong growth in construction and infrastructure projects, including growth in the construction of new
residential and commercial buildings, which in turn drives demand in our New Installation business and typically

96


-----

has a positive impact on our order intake and sales. Higher activity levels in the construction industry also tend to
lead to increases in the prices that we and our competitors are able to charge customers. Conversely, weaker
economic conditions in our markets tend to lead to lower levels of construction activity and lower demand in our
New Installation business, and therefore generally have a negative impact on our order intake and sales. Due to
economic impact of COVID-19, the global economy is likely entering a period of decline, which will probably
reduce construction activity around the world.

In the periods presented in this offering memorandum, strong construction activity in the Americas during the
2016/2017 and 2017/2018 Financial Years was a key driver of increases in order intake in the Americas segment,
whereas slowing construction activity in the Americas during the 2018/2019 Financial Year resulted in relatively
slower order intake. Overall, our sales declined between 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 but increased between
2017/2018 and 2018/2019, primarily due to the adverse impact of foreign exchange fluctuations.

Over the longer term, we believe that construction activity is more influenced by demographic and population
trends, such as the growth in urbanization, than by short-term economic factors. We believe that urbanization in
particular has been and will continue to be a fundamental long-term driver of demand for multi-story buildings
and large public infrastructure projects, and therefore of elevator and escalator products, notwithstanding shorterterm variations in demand arising from changes to activity levels in the construction industry and economic
developments. See “Industry.”

Our Service and Modernization businesses are impacted by conditions in the construction industry to a lesser
extent than the New Installation business. Services and Modernizations customers tend to enter into multi-year
service contracts and, given that customers in most countries are legally obliged to comply with elevator service
and safety requirements under applicable building codes, our Service business in particular tends to be relatively
stable and less susceptible to fluctuations in construction activity than our New Installation business. However,
construction activity has an indirect effect on our Service and Modernization businesses as the New Installation
business is an important source of new customers for both.

**_Growth of the New Installation business_**

The New Installation business comprises nearly half of our total sales in any given year, contributing 49%, 48%,
46% and 43% of our total sales in the 2016/2017, 2017/2018, 2018/2019 Financial Years (on a combined basis)
and the six months ended March 31, 2020 (on a consolidated basis), respectively. The New Installation
business’s larger importance lies in its significant contribution to growth in new Services and Modernizations
contracts, making it the starting point for our revenue life cycle. Our ability to grow our New Installation
business is therefore crucial to the growth of all three of our business lines. See “—Conversion of New
_Installations units into Services and Modernizations contracts and ability to retain existing, and win new,_
_Services and Modernizations customers.”_

We believe that our ability to consistently manufacture products that are competitive on price, safety, quality and
technology while maintaining an efficient supply chain in order to protect our margins are critical elements of the
growth of our New Installation business. To this end, we are currently in the process of streamlining our product
portfolio and standardizing certain components, as well as implementing a value-selling approach based on
offering customers a flexible pricing model in which pricing is determined by the degree of product
customization. See “—Operational improvement measures.” To a lesser extent, growth in the New Installation
business is also driven by our ability to win high profile mandates, such as prestigious and large-scale high rise
and infrastructure projects, which play a vital role in marketing our lower profile, but higher volume business.

**_Conversion of New Installations units into Services and Modernizations contracts and ability to retain_**
**_existing, and win new, Services and Modernizations customers_**

Our New Installation business is the entry gate to the Service and Modernization businesses, since a high
proportion of newly installed units are subsequently converted into paid Service contracts. The Service and the
Modernization businesses together accounted for 51%, 52%, 54% and 57% of our total sales in the 2016/2017,
2017/2018, 2018/2019 Financial Years (on a combined basis) and six months ended March 31, 2020 (on a
consolidated basis), respectively. Our Service business is a source of stable, recurring sales and high profit
margins for the Group. Service revenues can be categorized into either maintenance or repair sales (including
direct spare parts sales), and vary by segment, typically comprising over half of our sales in Europe/Africa and
the Americas but much less in Asia/Pacific, which is dominated by the New Installation business and Access
Solutions. Profit margins tend to be higher in the Service business than in the New Installation business, mainly
due to the recurring sales model and high customer retention rates. Many Service business’s customers
eventually become customers of the Modernization business, which further extends the customer relationship and
positions us well to provide Services to the modernized units.

97


-----

The key performance indicators for our Service business are the units under maintenance, the conversion rate and
the retention rate:

- _Units under maintenance: Units under maintenance is one of the Service business’s key drivers of sales_
growth. Over the last three financial years, units under maintenance increased at a CAGR of 1.7% to
approximately 1.4 million units as of March 31, 2020.

- _Conversion rate: The conversion rate is calculated as the percentage of New Installation units (excluding_
distributor sales, which do not directly result in access to servicing the relevant units) that have been
converted into paid Service contracts. We estimate that our global conversion rate was between 70% to 80%
in each of the 2016/2017, 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 Financial Years. The conversion rate thereby
contributes to the growth of our units under maintenance.

- _Retention rate: The retention rate is a like-for-like metric calculated as units under maintenance at the end of_
the year (excluding new units that were added during the year) divided by units under maintenance at the
beginning of the year. The terms of our service agreements vary by jurisdiction and customer, but most last
from one to five years, with service contracts following an installation often providing for an introductory
period (for example, one to two years) during which the customer is not obligated to pay for services. We
maintained a global average retention rate of above 90% on our service contracts over the last three
financial years.

We believe the key factors driving our conversion and retention rates are the breadth and global reach of our
service network, with approximately 1,000 service branches in our key markets worldwide, the quality of our
Services, our competitive pricing, and our innovative, digitally enhanced maintenance solutions, including
products like MAX and IT solutions such as our operating business steering tool VIEW.

In addition, we provide maintenance and modernization services on elevators and escalators installed by third
parties through our ITS unit. Our ITS unit provides specialized training to our service personnel and focuses on
the efficient refurbishment of spare parts. We believe that our ITS unit is more developed and advanced than that
of our competitors and has enhanced our ability to win Services and Modernizations work from customers of our
competitors.

**_Personnel costs_**

Our results of operations are significantly affected by personnel expenses, which, together with the costs of
materials, represent a significant majority of our operating costs. Personnel costs include wages and salaries,
social security, post-employment and other employee benefit costs. Personnel costs related to production workers
are included in cost of goods sold, whereas personnel costs for non-production workers are included in selling
expenses (for example, for sales force), general and administrative expenses (for example, for human resources
or other administrative functions), and research and development costs (for example, for our research engineers).
Our ability to effectively manage our personnel costs has a significant impact on our gross margin and overall
profitability.

In the periods under review in this offering memorandum, our personnel expenses remained relatively stable at
€3,135 million and €3,078 million in the 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 Financial Years, respectively, and increased
by 5.9% to €3,261 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. The increase in the 2018/2019 Financial Year was
primarily the result of increases in personnel expenses in the Americas and Asia/Pacific segments, reflecting
headcount growth primarily in the Service business as the business grew, as well as higher salaries and wages as
a result of tariff or other salary increases and impacts from translational exchange rate effects, partly offset by
headcount reductions in the Europe/Africa segment. Overall, our workforce remained broadly stable over the
period, with headcount numbers of 52.7 thousand in the 2016/2017 Financial Year, 53.0 thousand in the
2017/2018 Financial Year and 53.1 thousand in the 2018/2019 Financial Year.

We seek to manage personnel expenses mainly through adjusting our staffing levels to match our needs when
necessary, which can result in headcount growth in growing markets and reductions in slowing markets, or as a
result of efficiency measures adopted to offset the impact of personnel cost inflation. Recent examples include
our initiative to consolidate our US administrative functions in a shared service center at our US headquarters in
Atlanta, Georgia, which is expected to result in headcount reductions among back office and other personnel, as
well as our ongoing efforts to reduce complexity and optimize production processes at our manufacturing
facilities in the Americas and Europe. Over the 2016/2017, 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 Financial Years, we were
able to offset labor cost inflation by increasing labor efficiency, resulting in a global increase of sales per FTE.

Our ability to implement measures to control our personnel expenses is subject to constraints. In some
jurisdictions, such as the Americas and China, local labor laws and other regulations provide us with a relatively

98


-----

high degree of flexibility in adjusting our employee headcount based on needs, and thereby the attendant
personnel costs. In other jurisdictions, including Germany, our ability to optimize staffing levels and manage
personnel expenses is limited by restrictive labor laws and collective agreements, such as collective bargaining
agreements and works council agreements that are in place with trade unions as well as works councils and other
representative bodies.

**_External procurement spend_**

Our results of operations are significantly affected by our external procurement spend, which, together with
personnel costs, comprises a significant majority of our operating costs. Material cost increases exceeding sales
growth adversely impact our gross margin, and therefore our ability to control material cost is a key lever for
profitability. We manage our global purchasing activities through a Group-wide procurement organization in
order to leverage our purchasing ability and benefit from economies of scale and through implementing
initiatives to offset price inflation.

We purchase components and parts in each of our three business lines, but the largest exposure is in our New
Installation business, which has the highest material costs due to its manufacturing activities. Our purchases
cover a wide range of components, including electric and electronic components such as traction machines and
printed circuit board assemblies, as well as mechanical components such as guiderails, shaft/cabin doors, speed
governors and escalator steps, among others. These components contain raw materials such as steel, aluminum,
and rare earths (which are used in magnets), and therefore prices of these components are impacted by
fluctuations in the underlying raw material cost.

Prices for raw materials, components and parts are susceptible to fluctuations driven by global or regional
supply/demand dynamics in commodity and end markets, production capacity constraints of suppliers,
availability of certain materials, transportation costs, infrastructure failures, government regulations and tariffs,
geopolitical events, changes in currency exchange rates, the economic climate and other factors. For example,
between the 2017/2018 Financial Year and the 2018/2019 Financial Year, material prices increased in the
Americas mainly due to U.S. tariffs, which drove up material import costs. Between the 2016/2017 Financial
Year and the 2017/2018 Financial Year, material prices increased in the Asia/Pacific segment due to adverse
market price developments in China and Korea, which impacted our material costs as a result of the relatively
high proportion of New Installation business in Asia/Pacific. Our operations in China have a high exposure to
material price risk. However, during the 2017/2018 Financial Year when raw materials prices in China increased
significantly compared to the previous year, it only had a limited impact on our Group overall, as the reduction in
Adjusted EBIT in China during that year due to the raw material price increase was less than 5% of our Group’s
total Adjusted EBIT in the same year. In order to reduce this risk, we have, among other things, increased our
sales prices in China and are in regular supplier re-negotiations to reflect the material price movements.

In order to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of components, we try to source our goods on a
Group-wide level to leverage purchasing ability and economies of scale. We also aim to have at least two
suppliers for each component in different geographic regions and regularly review changes in material prices
based on published information. Nevertheless, market prices of parts and components are subject to increases as
a result of the fluctuation dynamics described above. Such price increases, along with increasing transportation
costs, have created some pressure on our profit margins. We seek to pass on cost increases to our customers
where possible; however, due to competition in the elevator and escalator industry, we have not always been able
to pass such increases on to customers in full. During the period under review, we partially offset cost increases
by optimizing our supply chains through commercial measures, such as holding supplier days, clustering
managed spend, and engaging in e-auctions, and technical efficiency measures, such as streamlining our product
platforms and standardizing components. In the 2018/2019 Financial Year, we achieved significant purchasing
savings compared to the prior year through these measures. See “—Operational improvement measures.”

**_Operational improvement measures_**

We operate in an industry where efficiency improvements and cost savings are crucial in order to maintain or
improve competitiveness and profitability. Our operational improvement measures focus broadly on four areas:
(i) simplification of our product portfolio and harmonizing of components in our New Installation business;
(ii) optimizing manufacturing efficiency and supply chains; (iii) increasing profitability by growing our Service
business and enhancing Service quality and efficiency via digital innovations, among other measures; and
(iv) reducing SG&A expenses. We have incurred substantial restructuring costs in connection with our
operational improvement measures, amounting to €106 million, €35 million and €56 million in the 2016/2017,
2017/2018 and 2018/2019 Financial Years (on a combined basis), respectively and €13 million in the six months
ended March 31, 2020 (on a consolidated basis). Restructuring costs in 2016/2017 were primarily driven by

99


-----

restructurings in Germany and France, whereas restructuring costs in 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 related to
restructurings in Europe and the Americas.

Following the Acquisition, we expect to realize €240 million in potential cost savings within 15 to 18 months
after July 1, 2020 through the Sponsors’ Transformation Program, assuming, among other things, that the
program will be implemented beginning on July 1, 2020 and driven by key management, including the Chief
Executive Officer of the Group. The Transformation Program focuses on cost savings opportunities related to
(i) commercial operations, (ii) service operations, (iii) procurement costs, (iv) G&A costs and (v) other
operational costs. We expect to incur one-off costs amounting to between €240 and €294 million in connection
with these initiatives, mainly as a result of (i) voluntary redundancy, early retirement and other severance costs,
(ii) staff training costs, (iii) investments in IT to digitize, automate and streamline processes, (iv) investments in
the existing shared service centers in Europe, Brazil and the U.S., as well as potentially operating new, regional
centers in Eastern Europe and Asia and (v) consulting, financial and legal advisory fees in connection with
implementing these initiatives.

_New Installations standardization_

Historically, in part due to our strategy of growing through acquisitions, we provided customers with a large
share of customized product solutions. This resulted in a highly diverse but overlapping product portfolio and
limited price competitiveness due to the high costs of designing and producing such a wide range of
individualized products. In order to drive cost efficiency by eliminating unnecessary duplication across the
portfolio, the number of product platforms in the Group has been reduced by more than half in the last decade as
part of a process of implementing a simplified portfolio structure, with further improvements planned going
forward. The revised structure is divided into building type (i.e. low-, mid- or high-rise) and degree of
customization and focuses on the most competitive platforms, which can be scaled across segments within each
market.

Where possible, we have also standardized and harmonized components across products. Historically, different
products tended to require their own unique components, leading to higher costs than necessary. We have already
streamlined our product designs to permit specific modular components, such as traction machines, controllers/
inverters and doors, to be shared across multiple product platforms and have targeted a number of additional
widely used components for future harmonization. This has resulted in less complexity and easier external
sourcing of components, among other benefits.

These efforts, which are ongoing, have allowed and will continue to allow us to leverage economies of scale and
allocate our resources more efficiently across the entire business.

_Manufacturing optimization_

We are engaged in an ongoing effort to optimize our manufacturing operations and supply chains. These
measures have included closing and consolidating manufacturing sites to improve our utilization rates,
restructuring factories to increase our focus on the most promising products and platforms, increasing
outsourcing of standardized components, and developing state-of-the-art factories that are highly automated and
equipped with improved technology, advancing from a classic factory to a fulfillment and engineering center.
Specifically, we have established lean manufacturing operations in Asia/Pacific, with a newly established plant in
India and advances in automation at our plants in China and Korea. In the Americas, we have in recent years
consolidated all manufacturing facilities in North America at our Middleton facility, which we believe will
further enhance efficiency and reduce costs. In Europe, we have restructured our Móstoles plant in Spain and are
currently restructuring our operations in Germany to reduce costs and simplify production. In Europe/Africa, we
have also shifted our factories away from a regional focus (in which a particular factory only serves specific
countries) to a model where all factories can deliver to the entire Europe/Africa region, with each factory having
a dedicated product focus.

In the long term, we aim to move away from a classic factory model, where the focus is on major production and
shipping of complete elevator systems and requires high personnel expenses, towards a model where we produce
only key, mission critical components and outsource commoditized parts, resulting in lower fixed costs and
higher productivity.

_Service and digitalization growth_

We aim to increase our profitability by growing our Service business, which is a source of stable, recurring sales
and high margins, through multiple initiatives. We intend to increase our conversion rate, particularly in regions
like China where conversion levels are currently lower than our global average, our global retention rate, and our

100


-----

rate of winning customers away from competitors by continuing to enhance the efficiency of our spare parts
organization and increasing our service training, as well as by leveraging the superior quality and improving field
performance of our Services and our capability to refurbish multi-brand spare parts. We believe that our
innovative use of digital technology, including the recently developed MAX system, improved and faster supply
chains for spare parts, as well as improved back office and IT functions such as our proprietary IT system VIEW,
will enable us to improve customer satisfaction by increasing service quality and efficiency, and thereby increase
customer retention rates and attract new customers while also leveraging efficiency gains. We target substantial
sales growth and efficiency gains in our Service and Modernization businesses in all regions between the
2019/2020 and 2021/2022 financial years.

_SG&A expense optimization_

We are committed to reducing SG&A and other expenses by centralizing administrative functions, harmonizing
our IT systems and adopting a range of organizational efficiency measures as part of our “SG&A Excellence”
program. Specifically, we are engaged in an ongoing effort to combine a wide array of administrative processes
that historically have been performed locally, such as billing, payroll and purchasing, into shared service centers.
This process is well advanced in the Americas, where for example in the United States these functions will be
consolidated into one shared service center at the U.S. headquarters in Atlanta, and we intend to roll it out in
other regions. We have in addition reduced the number of operating units within the Europe/Africa and the
Americas segments. We are also in the process of harmonizing our IT processes by rolling out VIEW globally,
continuing to transition to cloud-based services, and adopting global templates and standards, and driving
efficiency throughout the global organization by “delayering,” or flattening, management levels and adopting
other efficiency enhancements. These measures have resulted in more than €80 million in total SG&A savings
over the last three financial years. These savings, together with lower negative non-recurring items and positive
exchange rate effects, contributed to the decline in SG&A costs from €1,419 million in the 2016/2017 Financial
Year to €1,301 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year, despite general salary increases. SG&A costs increased
to €1,349 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year due to negative effects from exchange rates as well as sales
volume and general salary increases which more than offset operational improvement measures across the
Group.

_Procurement Optimization_

In addition, we aim to reduce our procurement costs by optimizing our supply chains through commercial
measures, such as, for example, supplier days, clustering managed spend, and engaging in e-auctions. For
example, between the 2011/2012 Financial Year and the 2018/2019 Financial Year, our purchasing savings
increased by 300%, outpacing our procurement spend which increased by 50%.

_Transformation Program_

As part of our commercial operations initiatives under the Transformation Program, we aim to improve our
organizational efficiency by restructuring and centralizing our sales supports team, including by shifting
employees to low cost countries. In addition, we seek to increase our sales force productivity through various
measures, including improving our administrative processes and completing faster technical sales. This is
facilitated by our offering of fewer customization options resulting from the optimization of our product and
service portfolios. We also intend to increase our focus on sales efforts based on product margin potentials and
the conversion of New Installation units into Service contracts and later into Modernization sales. We expect to
realize cost savings in an aggregate amount of €7 million related to our commercial operations initiatives.

As part of our service operations initiatives under the Transformation Program, we aim to improve our
organizational efficiency by rationalizing the number of our application engineers, reducing the number of
platforms in our offering, standardizing our service offering and reducing the number of our service centers,
particularly in the U.S. We intend to implement other measures under these initiatives as well, including
improving process, technology and performance management in order to increase the productivity of our service
technicians. We expect to realize cost savings in an aggregate amount of €15 million related to our service
operations initiatives.

As part of our procurement initiatives under the Transformation Program, we intend to implement multiple
measures to reduce costs relating to our procurement activities. For the 2018/2019 Financial Year, we believe
that our estimated addressable cost base for procurement activities comprised €2.1 billion of direct costs and
€0.5 billion of indirect costs. To reduce these costs, we intend to establish group-wide supply agreements with
global suppliers for key categories of direct materials, such as motors, cables and doors, including through
leveraging change-of-control provisions under our existing supplier agreements with local or regional suppliers.
We also expect to increase our focus on supplier driven innovation in connection with, among other things,

101


-----

tendering processes. To pursue improvements in specification management, we seek to standardize purchases for
complex parts and establish business unit sourcing boards, which will act as advisory panels in key end markets
to promote best practices and streamline procurement processes. Furthermore, we continue to shift our
relationships with local suppliers to regional suppliers in order to both increase the number of sites served by our
suppliers and decrease the number of our total suppliers, resulting in increased efficiencies. We also continue to
streamline the amount and variety of individually supplied components in order to purchase bundles of different
products and higher volumes of specific products, resulting in improved purchasing ability. Moreover, where
appropriate, we target shifting to agreements with suppliers in low cost countries or otherwise shifting purchases
from our suppliers of local products to products sourced from low cost countries. In addition, we are working to
utilize both centralized regional lead-buyers to streamline demand-management processes and defined sourcing
hubs to allow for best value and benchmark sourcing through increased spend, price and margin transparency.
Furthermore, we expect to realize cost savings from our commercial operations initiatives that result in the
rationalization of our product offering and standardization of our SKUs. We expect to realize cost savings in an
aggregate amount of €132 million in connection with our procurement initiatives.

As part of our G&A cost savings initiatives under the Transformation Program, we aim to improve our
organizational efficiency and generate attrition savings through a leaner operating model, the shifting of
employees to low cost countries and increased automation, including within our shared service centers. We
expect to realize cost savings in an aggregate amount of €36 million related to our G&A cost savings initiatives.

As part of our other operational initiatives under the Transformation Program, we aim to reduce direct and
indirect personnel expenses and scrappage costs by decreasing the portion of poor quality production. We target
replicating the cost of poor quality levels that we have achieved at our Korean plant (where such costs are
estimated to be 0.6% of internal sales) at our other plants, particularly our Middleton plant. We also intend to
outsource parts and components and streamline production overhead and assembly processes to reduce costs. We
expect to realize cost savings in an aggregate amount of €50 million related to our other operational initiatives.

_Pro Forma Information.”_

**_Corporate cost allocations_**

Our combined statements of profit or loss for the last three financial years include corporate cost allocations from
thyssenkrupp AG, which were retrospectively allocated to us in accordance with carve-out accounting principles
and represent a proportionate amount of corporate costs and non-operational effects that were historically
recorded at the parent company level without being recharged to the Elevator Technology Business. Our
corporate costs allocations (in regards to our EBIT) amounted to €98 million, €71 million and €66 million in the
2016/2017 Financial Year, 2017/2018 Financial Year and 2018/2019 Financial Year, respectively. Corporate cost
allocations within EBIT in the 2018/2019 Financial Year included corporate costs of €73 million and a partially
offsetting reversal of a provision with regard to unclaimed properties in the US in the amount of €7 million,
which qualified as a special item for Adjusted EBIT calculation. We do not consider these costs to be
representative of our additional standalone corporate costs going forward. The relevant functions will be
provided in the future by the Group itself. We estimate that additional standalone costs will amount to
approximately €30 million per annum going forward, resulting in generally lower general and administrative
costs than the amounts allocated to us in the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.

We are exposed to translation and transactional foreign exchange risks. Due to the broad scope of our
international operations, a substantial portion of our assets, liabilities, sales and expenses are denominated in
currencies other than the euro. Our predominant exposures are the U.S. dollar and the Chinese renminbi. Further
main foreign exchange exposures relate to the Brazilian real, the Canadian dollar and the South Korean won.

Changes in the exchange rates between these currencies can affect our operations and financial position as a
result of translational exchange rate effects. These effects arise because the financial results of thyssenkrupp
Elevator’s subsidiaries are measured in the currency of the primary economic environment in which the
subsidiary operates (our functional currency). The results of operations and assets and liabilities of a number of
thyssenkrupp Elevator’s global subsidiaries are, therefore, measured in currencies other than the euro and are
then translated into euro for presentation of our financial results, assets and liabilities in our financial statements.
Consequently, fluctuations in the applicable foreign currency exchange rates may increase or decrease the euro
value of our non-euro assets, liabilities, sales, costs and order intake, even if their value has not changed in the
local functional currency.

102


-----

We are also exposed to transactional risk to the extent our subsidiaries and we execute transactions in a currency
other than their functional currency, which arises mainly when we import components from one jurisdiction,
incurring a cost in that jurisdiction’s currency, and invoice for our products and installation in the local currency.
Our transactional risk exposure is less significant than our translation risk exposure, because we produce and
install our products predominantly in our key markets, which generally has the effect of matching the currencies
of our costs with those of our sales. Nonetheless, adverse exchange rate movements can impact the profitability
of our New Installation business and, to a lesser degree, the Modernization business, to the extent key imported
components become more expensive in our local sales areas.

The exchange rates between the functional currencies of our global subsidiaries and the euro have fluctuated
significantly in recent years and may continue to do so in the future. Our sales, for example, decreased by 1.2%
between the 2016/2017 Financial Year and the 2017/2018 Financial Year on an absolute basis, largely driven by
negative foreign exchange rate movements in the U.S. dollar, the Chinese renminbi, the Brazilian real and the
South Korean won, whereas in constant currency terms sales increased over the period. Sales increased by 5.0%
between the 2017/2018 Financial Year and the 2018/2019 Financial Year on an absolute basis but increased less
on a constant currency basis. Through their impact on sales and costs, foreign exchange movements also impact
our reported profitability.

**_Regulatory requirements_**

In all jurisdictions where we operate, our products and services are subject to laws, rules, regulations and
technical standards at international, supranational, national, state and municipal levels. In particular, this
regulatory framework governs the design, manufacture, installation, operation and product safety of our products
and services, and is mainly outlined in applicable building laws, building codes, specific safety codes for
elevators and escalators and other product safety laws, as well as laws governing airport ground equipment and
airport buildings. In addition, we are subject to regulatory requirements concerning product standards for energy
efficiency and sustainability.

These and other applicable laws are amended and revised from time to time, typically in ways that increase the
technical and safety standards applicable to elevators installed after their effective date. Such amendments and
revisions may require us to update our product designs and installation procedures to ensure our Products qualify
for the necessary operating licenses and otherwise comply with the new requirements. The cost of compliance
with these laws can be significant, impacting our operating and compliance costs and thereby our results of
operations.

At the same time, the laws described above are a key driver of sales in our Service and Modernization businesses,
as both new and existing customers (typically the owner of the building where work is carried out or in some
cases the property manager) are required to ensure their elevators and escalators are compliant with the
prevailing standards. Our Service business therefore offers a broad range of Services, from basic oil and grease
maintenance to bespoke full-service packages, to ensure, among other things, optimal safety and compliance with
the applicable laws in each jurisdiction where it installs and services elevators, escalators, and moving walks. In
addition, with the average age of buildings and of the installed base of elevators, escalators and moving walks
steadily growing in many countries, property owners increasingly need to invest in modernizing their elevators,
escalators and moving walks. We therefore offer comprehensive elevator and escalator modernization to enable
our customers to comply with applicable legal requirements and continue to operate safely. When governments
and regulators amend the laws or otherwise introduce new requirements, our New Installation business benefits
by marketing our products to construction companies and developers as compliant with such new requirements.
See “Regulation.”

**Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Financial Statements**

**_Stand-Alone Business_**

The Elevator Technology Business did not exist as a separate group prior to December 31, 2019. It formed part
of a larger group of companies controlled by thyssenkrupp AG and was reported as a segment within the
consolidated financial statements of thyssenkrupp AG. In order to facilitate the Acquisition, all companies and
operating activities that are part of the Elevator Technology Business were transferred, directly or indirectly, to
the Target in a corporate reorganization that was completed on December 31, 2019.

As the Elevator Technology Business did not exist as a separate group and since all companies and operating
activities within the Elevator Technology Business were under the common control of thyssenkrupp AG, in each
case, prior to the Reorganization, the financial information presented as of and for the financial years ended

103


-----

September 30, 2017, 2018 and 2019 has been prepared on a combined basis. Effective with the Reorganization,
the Elevator Technology Business came into existence as a separate group and therefore, the financial
information presented for the Target and its consolidated subsidiaries as of and for the six months ended March
31, 2019 and 2020 was prepared on a consolidated basis.

There are important differences between the Elevator Technology Business as presented in the Audited
Combined Financials as of and for the financial years ended September 30, 2017, 2018 and 2019 and the
business carried out by the Target and its subsidiaries as presented in the Unaudited Interim Consolidated
Financial Statements as of and for the six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2020. See “Presentation of
_Financial Information—Basis of Preparation” and our Financial Statements included elsewhere herein._

_The Audited Combined Financial Statements_

As IFRS does not provide guidelines for the preparation of combined financial statements, the preparation of the
Audited Combined Financial Statements was subject to IAS 8 “Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting
_Estimates and Errors,” particularly IAS 8.12, which required management of thyssenkrupp Elevator AG to_
consider recent pronouncements of other standard-setting bodies, other financial reporting requirements and
recognized industry practices in connection with the preparation of the Audited Combined Financial Statements.
Accordingly, in preparing the Audited Combined Financial Statements, thyssenkrupp Elevator applied the
predecessor accounting approach in accordance with recognized industry practices and rules on business
combinations under common control. In general, thyssenkrupp Elevator used the same accounting policies and
measurement principles in preparing the Audited Combined Financial Statements as were used in preparing the
IFRS consolidated financial statements of thyssenkrupp AG (the “extraction method”). This approach has been
adjusted with respect to transactions with thyssenkrupp Group companies and to ensure compliance with IFRS.
Transactions between the Elevator Technology Business and the remaining thyssenkrupp Group were recognized
in accordance with IFRS and classified as related party transactions as defined in IAS 24 “Related Party
_Disclosures.”_

New IFRS accounting standards were applied in the Audited Combined Financial Statements of the Elevator
Technology Business in fiscal years from October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2019, as follows:

- IFRS 9 (Financial instruments) was adopted in the 2018/2019 Financial Year by opting to apply the
standard prospectively (i.e., from the beginning of the 2018/2019 Financial Year) and accordingly, no
adjusted comparative information was disclosed.

- IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) was adopted in 2018/2019 Financial Year by applying
the full retrospective approach to initial application. Due to the financial statements of that fiscal year for
thyssenkrupp AG only presenting one comparative period, the cumulative transition effects were included
directly in retained earnings at the start of the comparative period on October 1, 2017. In contrast, for the
Audited Combined Financial Statements of the Elevator Technology Business, due to the additional
comparative period from October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017 presented, according to the full
retrospective approach, IFRS 15 has been applied from the beginning of the 2016/2017 Financial Year for
the Audited Combined Financial Statements of the Elevator Technology Business (i.e. the cumulative
transition effects were included directly in invested equity attributable to the thyssenkrupp AG at the start of
the comparative period on October 1, 2016).

- IFRS 16 (Leases) was adopted in the 2019/2020 Financial Year by thyssenkrupp AG by opting to apply the
simplified approach of using the modified retrospective method (i.e., the cumulative transition effects are
included directly in equity on October 1, 2019 and the standard is applied from the beginning of the
2019/2020 Financial Year) and no adjusted comparative information was accordingly disclosed.

Additional information on the scope and basis of preparation of the Audited Combined Financial Statements and
the application of significant accounting policies is presented in Note 1 “Basis of preparation” and Note 2
“Summary of significant accounting policies” to the Audited Combined Financial Statements.

As a result, the Audited Combined Financial Statements included in this offering memorandum may not reflect
what the results of operations, financial position and cash flows would have been had the Group operated as a
separate, stand-alone business without the shared resources of thyssenkrupp AG for the periods presented, and
may not be indicative of our future results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The fact that the
companies and operating activities comprising the Elevator Technology Business did not historically exist as a
separate group limits the validity of the combined financial information.

**_The Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements_**

The Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the six months ended March 31, 2020,
were prepared in accordance with IAS 34 and the requirements for first-time consolidated financial statements in
accordance with IFRS 1 (First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards). In preparing the
Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements, thyssenkrupp Elevator applied the predecessor accounting
approach in accordance with recognized industry practices and rules on business combinations under common
control in line with IDW RS HFA 50 Module IFRS 3 M2 published by the Institute of Public Auditors in
Germany (Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer in Deutschland e.V., IDW). In general, thyssenkrupp Elevator applied
the same accounting policies and measurement principles in preparing the Unaudited Interim Consolidated
Financial Statements as were used in preparing the IFRS consolidated financial statements of thyssenkrupp AG
(i.e., the “extraction method”). This approach has been adjusted with respect to transactions with thyssenkrupp
Group companies and to ensure compliance with IFRS. Transactions between thyssenkrupp Elevator and the
thyssenkrupp Group were recognized in accordance with IFRS and classified as related party transactions as
defined in IAS 24 “Related Party Disclosures.”

**_The Transactions_**

After the completion of the Transaction, we expect to report our financial results and condition at the level of
thyssenkrupp Elevator until September 30, 2021, and Vertical Topco III thereafter. The Financial Statements in
this offering memorandum have not been adjusted to reflect the impact of any changes that might occur as a
result of purchase price allocation effects to be applied as a result of the Transactions. However, Vertical Topco
III will account for the Acquisition using the acquisition method in accordance with IFRS 3 “Business
_Combinations” and will apply purchase price allocation effects in connection with the Transactions to their_
financial statements for accounting periods subsequent to the Acquisition Closing Date. The application of
purchase accounting could result in different carrying values for existing assets and assets we may add to our
balance sheet, which may include intangible assets, such as goodwill, leasehold rights and software, and different
amortization and depreciation expenses. Due to these and other potential adjustments, our future financial
statements could be materially different once the adjustments are made and may not be comparable to the
Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

Additional information on the necessary allocation procedures is set forth in Note 1 to the Audited Combined
Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

We will also incur a substantial amount of indebtedness as a result of the Transactions. As of March 31, 2020, on
an unaudited pro forma basis to give effect to the Transactions, we would have had €8,254 million of outstanding
total indebtedness, comprising the €4,050 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes offered hereby, the
€650 million in aggregate principal amount of Private Senior Notes, the €3,550 million in aggregate principal
amount of borrowings under the Senior Term Facilities and €4 million in aggregate principal amount of
borrowings under local facilities. See “Capitalization.”

In addition, we currently use “thyssenkrupp” as part of our product marks, corporate marks and as part of the
company names, business designations and domains to operate our business which is licensed from thyssenkrupp
AG. Under the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, we are required to make commercially reasonable best
efforts to introduce a new brand for our business within six months after the Acquisition Closing Date. Further,
the existing licensing arrangement to use the mark “thyssenkrupp” will cease at the end of eighteen months from
the Acquisition Closing Date. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Relationships with
_the thyssenkrupp Group in the Past—License Agreement.” The intangible asset for the right of use of the_
thyssenkrupp brand has been classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 in the Unaudited Interim
Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 1 to our Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements.

Accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations may differ from the historical financial condition
and results of operations presented in this discussion as a result of the Transactions

**_Changes to Accounting Standards—IFRS 16 (Leases)_**

The Financial Statements are prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS. On January 13, 2016, the IASB
published IFRS 16 (Leases), and the European Union adopted IFRS 16 on November 9, 2017. IFRS 16 replaced
IAS 17 and the related IFRIC and SIC interpretations, and resulted in almost all leases being recognized on the
balance sheet, as the distinction between operating and finance leases was eliminated. Under the new standard,
the lessee recognizes an asset (the right-to-use the leased asset) and a financial liability to pay lease payments.
The only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases should a company elect to apply an available practical

105


-----

expedient in order to reduce the transition effort. IFRS 16 became effective for fiscal years commencing on or
after January 1, 2019.

The Group adopted IFRS 16 (Leases) on October 1, 2019, by opting to apply the simplified approach of using the
modified retrospective method, which means that the cumulative transition effects are included directly in equity
on October 1, 2019 and the standard is applied from the beginning of the 2019/2020 Financial Year.
Accordingly, no adjusted comparative information was disclosed.

The first-time adoption of IFRS 16 had significant impact on certain balance sheet and income statement items,
as described above and also in Note 3 in the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements.

The transition to IFRS 16 on October 1, 2019, gave rise to changes to our assets and liabilities. As a result,
figures as of and for the six months ended March 31, 2020, may not be comparable to the results presented for
prior periods. As of March 31, 2020, our right-of-use assets amounted to €397 million and lease liabilities
amounted to €330 million. The depreciation of right-of-use assets for the six months ended March 31, 2020,
amounted to €49 million and the interest expense from lease liabilities amounted to €8 million.

See Note 2 to the Audited Combined Financial Statements and Note 3 to the Unaudited Interim Consolidated
Financial Statements for more information about our application of IFRS 16.

**_Impact of COVID-19_**

The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted both our Elevator and Escalator division and our Access Solutions
division across all regions to varying degrees. See “Summary—Recent Developments—Coronavirus (COVID_19).”_

We believe that in the medium to long term, the outbreak of COVID-19 will not have a material adverse effect on
our overall business and results of operations, due to the underlying resilience of our business and immediate
implementation of contingency measures. Our New Installation business was temporarily impacted in countries
with lockdown measures, as discussed above. However, all our manufacturing plants are currently operational.
Our Service business has performed largely as expected, given applicable safety and regulatory requirements.

In our Financial Statements, COVID-19 is considered as a trigger event for an impairment test of goodwill as of
March 31, 2020. Therefore, the operational planning of the Elevator Technology Business was tested for validity
against the background of the COVID-19 pandemic and, in effect, the recoverability of goodwill of the Elevator
Technology Business was not classified as critical. Furthermore, other intangible assets and property, plant and
equipment were also tested for impairment per March 31, 2020, which did not result in any impairment losses for
the Elevator Technology Business.

The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and the industry will ultimately depend on a number of
factors, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the outbreak and the length of time it takes for
demand and return and for normal economic and operating conditions to resume. Accordingly, our financial
condition and results of operations will differ in respect of the current year and for future periods, when
compared to the historical financial condition and results of operations presented in this discussion.

**_Issues Regarding Local Book Keeping and Financial Reporting Processes_**

The independent auditor’s report on the Audited Combined Financial Statements is qualified due to issues
regarding local book keeping and financial reporting processes, which led to qualified, adverse or disclaimer of
opinions on the financial information of certain entities of the Elevator Technology Business’s Operating Unit
Spanish Latin America (as defined in the Financial Statements). Due to these issues, PwC was unable to obtain
sufficient information and evidence required to assess the existence, completeness, valuation and cut-off of the
assets and liabilities as well as the income and expense of these subsidiaries and, as a result, was unable to
determine whether any adjustments might have been necessary in respect of the combined financial position as of
September 30, 2018 and 2017 and the combined statements of profit and loss, comprehensive income and
changes in equity or net cash flows as reported in the combined statement of cash flows for the financial years
ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 (see Note 1 of the Audited Combined Financial Statements). The
auditor’s qualification does not pertain to the combined statement of financial position as of September 30, 2019
included in the Audited Combined Financial Statements.

In the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements, the issues relating to the Elevator Technology
Business’s Operating Unit Spanish Latin America described above still remained for the six-month period ended
March 31, 2019 (see Note 1 of the other explanatory notes of the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial
Statements).

As a result, the financial information as of and for the periods presented below may not be comparable with
subsequent periods.

**Key Line Items in Our Statements of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income**

Set forth below is a description of the key line items presented in our Financial Statements. Our key line items
are reported on the basis of uniform accounting policies that are implemented at each entity within our scope of
consolidation.

**_Sales_**

Sales primarily includes revenue generated from contracts with customers related to the New Installation
business, the Service business and the Modernization business in the respective business units.

**_Cost of sales_**

Cost of sales includes the production and purchase costs incurred to generate the sales. In addition to direct
material costs, non-staff overheads and personnel costs, which represent the majority of cost of sales, production
costs also include production-related indirect costs, including depreciation of production facilities and warranty
costs.

**_Gross margin_**

Gross margin is the difference between sales and cost of sales.

**_Research and development cost_**

Research and development cost includes expenses in connection with research and development activities not
eligible for capitalization and other costs related to the functional area of research and development.

**_Selling expenses_**

Selling expenses include personnel costs related to distribution and costs for distributing products, including
marketing and transportation and other costs related to the functional area of distribution.

**_General and administrative expenses_**

General and administrative expenses include costs incurred in operating and administering the business, and
consist primarily of expenses for salaries of non-production workers and headquarters expenses and other costs
related to the functional area of general administration.

**_Other income_**

Other income includes all operating income that is not included in or attributable to sales.

**_Other expenses_**

Other expenses includes all operating expenses that are not included in or attributable to the functional categories
mentioned above.

**_Other gains/(losses), net_**

Other gains/(losses), net includes results from disposals of non-current assets such as property, plant and
equipment or intangible assets.

**_Income/(loss) from operations_**

Income/(loss) from operations is the sum of gross margin, research and development cost, selling expenses,
general and administrative expenses, other income, other expenses and other gains/(losses), net.

**_Income from companies accounted for using the equity method_**

Income from companies accounted for using the equity method relates to the result from investments in
associates and joint ventures, which are initially (at acquisition) measured at cost in the statement of financial
position, and our share of net income/loss of the investee generated after acquisition is recognized in the
statement of profit or loss.

107


-----

**_Finance income_**

Finance income consists of interest income from financial receivables, income from valuation of interest
derivatives, other interest and similar income.

_Sales_

Our sales increased by €87 million, or 2.3% from €3,795 million in the six months ended March 31, 2019 to
€3,882 million in the six months ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by increased sales in
our Americas segment. In the United States, sales increased across all business lines and were particularly strong
within the Service business. This was partly offset by lower sales in our Europe/Africa segment as a result of
lower sales from the manufacturing entities to other business units, as well as COVID-19 related decline,
especially in the second quarter in the Asia/Pacific segment.

Our sales for the Europe/Africa segment decreased from €1,064 million or 2.9% in the six months ended
March 31, 2019 to €1,033 million in the six months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by
lower sales due to less supply for major projects to other Operating Segments.

Our sales for the Americas segment increased by €92 million, or 5.8%, from €1,597 million in the six months
ended March 31, 2019 to €1,689 million in the six months ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily
driven by an increase in sales across all business lines in the United States, positive exchange rate effects from
USD and additional sales from companies acquired in the second half of the previous Financial Year. The
positive effects were partly offset by lower sales in South America, mainly due adverse exchange rate effects
from BRL.

Our sales for the Asia/Pacific segment decreased by €19 million, or 1.8%, from €1,047 million in the six months
ended March 31, 2019 to €1,028 million in the six months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily
driven by lower New Installation sales in the Middle East due to less major infrastructure projects, as well as
COVID-19 related sales decline in China in the second quarter.

Our sales for the Access Solutions segment increased by €3 million, or 1.6%, from €188 million in the six
months ended March 31, 2019 to €191 million in the six months ended March 31, 2020. The increase was
primarily driven by higher New Installation and Service sales in our airport solutions in the United States, partly
offset by a decline in the home solutions sales, mainly due to COVID-19, with the main impact in China and to a
lesser extent, in Europe.

_Cost of sales_

Our cost of sales increased by €70 million, or 2.5%, from €2,767 million in the six months ended March 31, 2019
to €2,837 million in the six months ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by a higher sales
volume in the Americas segment.

_Research and development cost_

Our research and development cost increased by €5 million, or 16.1%, from €31 million in the six months ended
March 31, 2019 to €36 million in the six months ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by
higher amortization related to capitalized global R&D project costs.

_Selling expenses_

Our selling expenses increased by €8 million, or 3.2%, from €250 million in the six months ended March 31,
2019 to €258 million in the six months ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by an increase
of allowances for financial assets in the Europe/Africa and Asia/Pacific segments.

_General and administrative expenses_

Our general and administrative expenses decreased by €35 million, or 8.3%, from €421 million in the six months
ended March 31, 2019 to €386 million in the six months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily
driven by lower personnel expenses as a result of operational improvement measures mainly in the Americas
segment, particularly in the United States and the Europe/Africa segment, especially in manufacturing in Spain
and Italy and Corporate Elevator segments. Furthermore, lower restructuring related costs in the Americas
segment (mainly in the United States) and Europe/Africa (mainly manufacturing and British Islands), as well as
lower travel expenses across all segments positively impacted the cost development.

_Other income_

Our other income decreased by €6 million, or 17.6%, from €34 million in the six months ended March 31, 2019
to €28 million in the six months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by lower
miscellaneous income gains.

_Other expenses_

Our other expenses increased by €12 million or 11.7% from €103 million in the six months ended March 31,
2019 to €115 million in the six months ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by higher
expenses relating to the license agreement with thyssenkrupp AG in connection with the use of the
“thyssenkrupp” brand, partly offset by reduced miscellaneous other expenses.

_Financial income/(expense), net_

Our financial income/(expense), net decreased by €37 million from an income of €13 million in the six months
ended March 31, 2019 to an expense of €(24) million in the six months ended March 31, 2020. This effect was
primarily driven by financial interest paid for thyssenkrupp Group intragroup financial accounts in the current
reporting period versus financial income received for thyssenkrupp Group intragroup financial accounts in the
previous reporting period.

_Income tax (expense)/income_

Our income tax (expense)/income decreased by €8 million, or 8.3%, from €(96) million in the six months ended
March 31, 2019 to €(88) million in the six months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by
lower pre-tax results.

_Adjusted EBIT_

six months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019.

Our Adjusted EBIT increased by €26 million, or 7.2%, from €362 million in the six months ended March 31,
2019 to €388 million in the six months ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by higher
profits in the Americas segment, namely in the United States where profitable Service growth and favorable
exchange rate effects contributed to the positive result, the Asia/Pacific segment due to operational improvement
measures, which influenced the result positively and could compensate for negative implications from the
COVID-19 pandemic.

Our Europe/Africa segment’s Adjusted EBIT remained largely constant with a marginal increase of €1 million
from €101 million in the six months ended March 31, 2019 to €102 million in the six months ended March 31,
2020. The increase was primarily driven by higher sales and more profitable margins as a result of operational
improvements in the DACH region.

Our Americas segment’s Adjusted EBIT increased by €15 million, or 6.6%, from €227 million in the six months
ended March 31, 2019 to €242 million in the six months ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily
driven by a higher sales volume in the United States, especially within the profitable Service business and by
positive exchange rate effects.

Our Asia/Pacific segment’s Adjusted EBIT increased by €7 million, or 11.5%, from €61 million in the six
months ended March 31, 2019 to €68 million in the six months ended March 31, 2020. The increase was
primarily driven by a higher share of Service profits as well as a solid development of the New Installation
business in China, partially offset by negative impact from the COVID-19 pandemic in the second quarter.

Our Access Solutions division’s Adjusted EBIT decreased by €9 million, or 29.0%, from €31 million in the six
months ended March 31, 2019 to €22 million in the six months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease was
primarily driven by lower profits from home solutions offerings, due to lower sales mainly from the COVID-19
pandemic in China and Europe and lower contributions from the reseller business in Europe.

_Sales_

Our sales increased by €382 million, or 5.0%, from €7,579 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year to
€7,961 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. The increase was primarily driven by strong growth in the
Americas segment as a result of robust increases in both New Installations and Services due to higher repair sales
in the United States, moderate growth in the Europe/Africa segment due to growth in Service sales in Germany
and Spain and New Installations growth in the Access Solutions segment, partially offset by a decline in the Asia/
Pacific segment due to weaker market development in New Installations in South Korea. The increase in sales
was supported by broadly positive currency effects.

Our sales in the Europe/Africa segment increased by €32 million, or 1.5%, from €2,117 million in the 2017/2018
Financial Year to €2,149 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. The increase was primarily driven by
moderate growth in Service sales in Germany and Spain, supported by continued strong conversion and retention
rates, partially offset by negative currency effects from the Turkish lira.

111


-----

Our sales in the Americas segment increased by €323 million, or 10.8%, from €2,983 million in the 2017/2018
Financial Year to €3,306 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. The increase was primarily driven by robust
increases in both New Installations as well as Services due to strong growth in repair sales in the United States.
Positive currency effects from the U.S. dollar also contributed to the increase.

Our sales in the Asia/Pacific segment decreased by €30 million, or 1.3%, from €2,337 million in the 2017/2018
Financial Year to €2,307 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. The decrease was primarily driven by weaker
market development in New Installations in South Korea, partly offset by Service growth due to robust
conversions of units from the New Installation business in China as a result of continued high New Installations
sales volumes and positive exchange rate effects mainly relating to the Chinese renminbi.

Our sales in the Access Solutions segment increased by €13 million, or 3.5%, from €372 million in the
2017/2018 Financial Year to €385 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. The increase was primarily driven by
New Installations growth in the Home Solutions business.

_Cost of sales_

Our cost of sales increased by €274 million, or 4.9%, from €5,552 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year to
€5,826 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. Such increase mirrored the percentage increase in sales for the
period, with cost of sales as a percentage of sales remaining constant at 73% for both Financial Years. Personnel
costs increased due to labor cost inflation in all segments and due to adverse currency effects particularly in the
Americas segment, but were partly offset by increased labor efficiency and structural improvements resulting
from our operational improvement measures. Material costs increased in the United States due to volume
increases in both the New Installation business and the Service business and due to the impact of U.S. tariffs, for
which the positive effects from purchasing volume savings programs could only partly compensate. Operational
issues at the Middleton manufacturing facility also had a negative impact on cost of sales in the Americas. In the
Asia/Pacific segment, lower sales volumes in South Korea and material cost-reduction measures in China
contributed to lower cost of sales.

_Research and development cost_

Our research and development cost increased by €4 million, or 5.9%, from €68 million in the 2017/2018
Financial Year to €72 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. The increase was primarily driven by higher costs
for regular product maintenance activities in the Europe/Africa segment, which is required and conducted in
order to keep our product portfolio up-to-date and to ensure that our products comply with all codes and
standards.

_Selling expenses_

Our selling expenses increased by €35 million, or 7.4%, from €476 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year to
€511 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. The increase was primarily driven by higher sales volumes and
foreign exchange rate effects mainly in the Americas segment as well as general salary increases, partially offset
by efficiency gains from operational improvement measures.

_General and administrative expenses_

Our general and administrative expenses increased by €13 million, or 1.6%, from €825 million in the 2017/2018
Financial Year to €838 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. These were primarily due to general inflationary
cost increases and adverse impact from foreign exchange fluctuations, partly offset by the effect of operational
improvement measures focused on reducing global SG&A costs.

_Other income_

Our other income increased by €9 million, or 17.6%, from €51 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year to
€60 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year due to miscellaneous income gains.

_Other expenses_

Our other expenses increased by €21 million, or 11.4%, from €185 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year to
€206 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. The increase was primarily driven by a provision taken in
connection with a lawsuit.

_Financial income/(expense), net_

Our financial income/(expense), net decreased by €7 million, or 30.4%, from €23 million in the 2017/2018
Financial Year to €16 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. The decrease was primarily driven by a
€23 million increase in financial expense over the period mainly due to higher interest expenses owed on
thyssenkrupp Group intragroup financial accounts, offset by a €15 million increase in financial income due to
higher interest income earned on thyssenkrupp Group intragroup financial accounts.

_Income tax (expense)/income_

Our income tax (expense)/income increased by €97 million, or 76.4%, from €(127) million in the 2017/2018
Financial Year to €(224) million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. The increase was primarily driven by the
absence of one-time effects from the US tax reform which had occurred in the previous year.

_Adjusted EBIT_

The table below sets forth our Adjusted EBIT by segments and the period on period percentage of change for the
2018/2019 and the 2017/2018 Financial Years.

Our Adjusted EBIT increased by €56 million, or 7.3%, from €763 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year to
€819 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. The increase was primarily driven by increased profit contribution
from all our Operating Segments.

Our Americas segment’s Adjusted EBIT increased from €476 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year to
€489 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year, driven by growth in the Service business supported by increased
repair sales, positive impacts from efficiency gains and purchasing volume savings programs and positive
exchange rate effects mainly relating to the US dollar, offsetting the negative developments in the New
Installation business relating mainly to adverse material price effects resulting from US tariffs and operational
inefficiencies at the Middleton manufacturing facility.

Our Europe/Africa segment’s Adjusted EBIT increased from €212 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year to
€227 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year, primarily driven by growth in the Service Business, especially in
Germany, as well as efficiency gains and structural improvements from operational improvement measures.

Our Asia/Pacific segment’s Adjusted EBIT increased from €148 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year to
€178 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year, primarily driven by higher profits from the New Installation
business due to improved market pricing and material cost reduction measures in China as well as growth in the
Service business due to robust conversion from New Installation business units in China. These effects were
partly offset by negative developments resulting from the market decline of the New Installation business in
South Korea.

Our Access Solutions division’s Adjusted EBIT increased from €58 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year to
€62 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. The increase was primarily driven by reductions of corporate costs.

_Sales_

Our sales decreased by €95 million, or 1.2%, from €7,674 million in the 2016/2017 Financial Year to
€7,579 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year. The decrease was primarily due to adverse currency effects,
particularly with respect to the U.S. dollar and the Brazilian real, which negatively impacted sales in the
Americas segment, as well as adverse currency effects with respect to the Chinese renminbi and the South
Korean won, which negatively impacted sales in the Asia/Pacific segment. As a consequence, sales in the
Americas segment declined by 4.4% between the 2016/2017 Financial Year and the 2017/2018 Financial Year,
while sales in the Asia/Pacific segment increased by 1.7%. Excluding currency effects, sales increased in the
Americas due to strong levels of construction activity, which drove New Installations, and increased at a higher
rate in Asia/Pacific due to growth in Services. Sales in the Europe/Africa segment increased by 2.6% over the
period, partially offsetting the decrease resulting from the sales decline in the Americas segment.

**Total Sales** **7,674** **7,579** **(1.2)%**

Our sales in the Europe/Africa segment increased by €54 million, or 2.6%, from €2,063 million in the 2016/2017
Financial Year to €2,117 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year. The increase was primarily driven by higher
sales in the New Installation business as a result of major infrastructure projects delivered by the Europe/Africa
segment to our Middle East region. There was marginal sales growth in the Service and Modernization

114


-----

businesses, mainly driven by operations in the DACH operating unit (comprising Germany, Austria and
Switzerland), supported by strong conversion and retention rates. These increases were partly offset by negative
currency effects with respect to the Turkish lira and the Russian ruble.

Our sales in the Americas segment decreased by €136 million, or 4.4%, from €3,119 million in the 2016/2017
Financial Year to €2,983 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year. The decrease was primarily driven by negative
currency effects in the U.S. dollar and Brazil real, which mainly impacted the New Installation business, partially
mitigated by strong levels of construction activity and growth in the Service businesses as a result of
management’s focus on increasing repair sales and increased growth in Modernizations contracts in the United
States.

Our sales in the Asia/Pacific segment increased by €39 million, or 1.7%, from €2,298 million in the 2016/2017
Financial Year to €2,337 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year. Strong conversion rates in China and South
Korea resulted in significant Services growth, which was partly offset mainly by negative currency effects with
respect to the Chinese renminbi and the South Korean won. Sales in the New Installation business Unit suffered
mainly due to a weaker market in South Korea.

Our sales in the Access Solutions segment increased by €4 million, or 1.1%, from €368 million in the 2016/2017
Financial Year to €372 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year. The increase was primarily driven by growth in
New Installations as a result of major airport projects in Turkey and the United States, partially offset by declines
in Services and Modernizations sales as a result of the expiry of certain Service agreements and the completion
of several Modernizations projects.

_Cost of sales_

Our cost of sales remained relatively constant at €5,561 million in the 2016/2017 Financial Year and
€5,552 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year. Cost of sales increased slightly as a percentage of sales from
72.5% in the 2016/2017 Financial Year to 73.3% in the 2017/2018 Financial Year due to material costs increases
in the Asia/Pacific segment as a result of negative price developments in China and South Korea, which mainly
impacted New Installation, the largest business in that region. These increases were offset by decreases in the
Americas segment as a result of favorable currency effects with respect to the U.S. dollar and Brazilian real,
although material prices in the Americas were also adversely impacted by U.S. tariffs, mainly on steel imports
from China, over the period. Material price increases were also partly offset by positive impacts from purchasing
volume savings programs.

Personnel costs were broadly stable over the period, as labor cost inflation effects were offset by increased labor
efficiency measures and favorable currency effects.

_Research and development cost_

Our research and development cost decreased by €19 million, or 21.8%, from €87 million in the 2016/2017
Financial Year to €68 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year. The decrease was primarily driven by the
capitalization, in accordance with IAS 38, of certain research and development expenses in the 2017/2018
Financial Year (including global projects such as MULTI and other mature and professionalized global research
and development projects).

_Selling expenses_

Our selling expenses decreased by €76 million, or 13.8%, from €552 million in the 2016/2017 Financial Year to
€476 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year. The decrease was primarily driven by a decline in allowances for
financial assets, mainly due to allowances in connection with a restructuring program in the Middle East which
were recorded in the 2016/17 Financial Year. Further decreases resulted from SG&A improvement measures
globally, particularly in Asia/Pacific where we made progress centralizing administrative costs and carrying out
other cost savings initiatives in China, and favorable exchange rates with respect to the U.S. dollar.

_General and administrative expenses_

Our general and administrative expenses decreased by €42 million, or 4.8%, from €867 million in the 2016/2017
Financial Year to €825 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year. The decrease was primarily driven by reduced
corporate cost allocations from thyssenkrupp AG, operational improvements and a positive impact from
exchange rates mainly in relation to the U.S. dollar.

_Other income_

Our other income increased by €10 million, or 24.4%, from €41 million in the 2016/2017 Financial Year to
€51 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year, primarily due to a one-time legal settlement.

_Other expenses_

Our other expenses increased by €49 million, or 36.0%, from €136 million in the 2016/2017 Financial Year to
€185 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year. The increase was primarily driven by increased expenses relating
to license fee payments to thyssenkrupp AG in connection with our use of the “thyssenkrupp” brand.

_Financial income/(expense), net_

Our financial income/(expense), net decreased by €4 million, or 14.8%, from €27 million in the 2016/2017
Financial Year to €23 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year. The decrease was primarily driven by a
€27 million decrease in finance income over the period mainly due to lower interest income earned on
thyssenkrupp Group intragroup financial accounts which was offset by a €23 million decrease in finance expense
as a result of lower interest expenses owed on thyssenkrupp Group intragroup financial accounts.

_Income tax (expense)/income_

Our income tax (expense)/income decreased by €151 million, or 54.3%, from €(278) million in the 2016/2017
Financial Year to €(127) million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year. The decrease was primarily driven by the US
tax reform, which resulted in a devaluation of deferred tax liabilities in the United States as well as a lower
applicable tax rate on US profits in the 2017/18 financial year.

_Adjusted EBIT_

The table below sets forth our Adjusted EBIT by segment and the period on period percentage of change for the
2017/2018 and 2016/2017 Financial Years.

Our Adjusted EBIT decreased by €49 million, or 6%, from €812 million in the 2016/2017 Financial Year to
€763 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. The decrease was primarily driven by reduced profit contribution
from the New Installation business in the Asia/Pacific and Europe/Africa segments and negative exchange rate
developments mainly related to the US dollar, as offset by the growth of the Service business in the Americas
segment.

Our Adjusted EBIT in the Europe/Africa segment decreased from €223 million in the 2016/2017 Financial Year
to €212 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year. The decrease was primarily driven by lower profitability in the
New Installation business due to performance issues in both project execution in Turkey and France as well as in
the Group’s European manufacturing operations, which was only partly offset by Service business growth and
positive impacts from restructuring and efficiency measures in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and France.

Our Adjusted EBIT in the Americas segment decreased from €509 million in the 2016/2017 Financial Year to
€476 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year. The decrease was primarily driven by lower profitability in the
New Installation business due to adverse currency effects with respect to the US dollar and Brazilian real, as well
as increased costs arising from US tariffs, in particular for steel imports from China, only partly offset by positive
effects from Service growth and efficiency measures.

Our Adjusted EBIT in the Asia/Pacific segment decreased from €203 million in the 2016/2017 Financial Year to
€148 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year. The decrease was primarily driven by decreased profitability in
the New Installation business as a result of negative material cost developments in China and South Korea. These

116


-----

effects were partially offset by profit gains from efficiency measures in China in the form of centralization and
other cost savings initiatives as well as Service business growth due to conversion of units from the New
Installation business.

Our Adjusted EBIT in the Access Solutions division increased from €55 million in the 2016/2017 Financial Year
to €58 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year. The increase was primarily driven by higher sales volumes, in
particular two major airport projects in Turkey and the United States, and operational improvements as a result of
SG&A cost reductions.

**Liquidity and Capital resources**

**_Overview_**

Following the completion of the Transactions, we expect that our principal sources of liquidity will be cash flows
from operations and drawings under our Revolving Credit Facility. The availability of our Revolving Credit
Facility will be subject to certain conditions.

We aim to manage capital to ensure that all companies within the Elevator Technology Business can continue to
operate as a going concern. Our ability to generate cash flow from operations depends on our future operating
performance, which is in turn dependent on general economic, financial, competitive, market and other factors,
many of which are beyond our control. In addition, we anticipate that we will be highly leveraged for the
foreseeable future and our ability to generate future financing cash flows will be limited by the Indentures and
the Senior Facilities, which may have important negative consequences for you. See “Risk Factors,”
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness,” “Description of the
_Senior Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “Description of Certain Financing_
_Arrangements.” Any additional indebtedness that we do incur could reduce the amount of our cash flow available_
to make payments on our then existing indebtedness, including under the Notes offered hereby, and increase our
leverage.

The proceeds from the Offering will be used as set forth under “Use of Proceeds.”

**_Cash Flows_**

The following table sets forth the principal components of our cash flows on a combined basis for the 2016/2017,
2017/2018 and 2018/2019 Financial Years and on a consolidated basis for the six months ended March 31, 2020
and 2019 respectively.

_Operating cash flows_

Our operating cash flows on a consolidated basis increased by €113 million, or 146.8%, from €77 million in the
six months ended March 31, 2019 to €190 million in the six months ended March 31, 2020. The increase was
primarily driven by the increased net income (before non-cash items like depreciation, amortization and deferred
taxes) partially offset by an overall increase in net working capital.

Our operating cash flows on a combined basis increased by €200 million, or 72.5%, from €276 million in the
2017/2018 Financial Year to €476 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. The increase was primarily driven by
declines in working capital, including positive cash flow effects from development of inventories, trade accounts
receivable and contract assets, partially offset by net negative cash flow effects from net development of contract
liabilities and provisions. The increase was also due to minor effects resulting from an increase in net income
before non-cash items, mainly comprising deferred tax effects.

-----

Our operating cash flows on a combined basis decreased by €217 million, or 44.0%, from €493 million in the
2016/2017 Financial Year to €276 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year, despite an increase in net income
before changes in working capital. The decrease was primarily driven by the significant overall increase in net
working capital, including negative cash flow effects from development of trade accounts receivable, contract
assets, provisions and trade payables, partially offset by positive cash flow effects from development of contract
liabilities. The decrease was also due to effects resulting from increased net income before non-cash items,
including depreciation, amortization and deferred taxes.

_Cash flows from investing activities_

Our cash outflows on a consolidated basis from investing activities strongly increased by €3,228 million from
€58 million in the six months ended March 31, 2019 to €3,286 million in the six months ended March 31, 2020.
The increase was primarily driven by acquisitions of shares in the Group companies from thyssenkrupp Group
during the six months ended March 31, 2020 as part of the legal reorganization of the Group finalized as of
December 31, 2019.

Our cash outflows on a combined basis from investing activities increased by €1,267 million from €116 million
in the 2017/2018 Financial Year to €1,383 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. This increase was primarily
driven by the one-time €1,080 million fee paid in connection with the Licensing Agreement for the use of the
“thyssenkrupp” brand (see “Business—Intellectual Property”), increased expansions and major project
expenditure, specifically the acquisitions of Nashville Machine Elevator and O’Keefe Elevator Company Inc. and
advance payments in connection with thyssenkrupp Group internal asset transfers, including €74 million of real
estate assets, in preparation for the operational carve-out of the elevator technology business.

Our cash outflows on a combined basis from investing activities decreased by €29 million, or 20.0%, from
€145 million in the 2016/2017 Financial Year to €116 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year. The decrease was
primarily driven by a decrease in cash outflow for capital expenditures mainly with respect to property, plant and
equipment following the finalization of several major investments in the Asia/Pacific segment.

_Cash flows from financing activities_

Our cash flows on a consolidated basis from financing activities strongly increased by €3,052 million from an
outflow of €32 million in the six months ended March 31, 2019 to an inflow of €3,020 million in the six months
ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by a significant increase in amounts received from
thyssenkrupp Group due to the existing integration of the Group into the cash pooling of thyssenkrupp Group and
due to capital increases. These increased cash inflows were mainly associated with the already mentioned legal
reorganization of the Group.

Our cash flows on a combined basis from financing activities increased by €1,156 million, or 583.8%, from an
outflow of €198 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year to an inflow of €958 million in the 2018/2019 Financial
Year. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in amounts received pursuant to thyssenkrupp Group
intragroup financing arrangements.

Our cash outflow on a combined basis from financing activities decreased by €151 million, or 43.3%, from
outflows of €349 million in the 2016/2017 Financial Year to outflows of €198 million in the 2017/2018 Financial
Year. The decrease in cash outflows was primarily driven by a net decrease in amounts paid pursuant to
thyssenkrupp Group intragroup financing arrangements.

**_Capital Expenditures_**

Our capital expenditures primarily relate to expansion and major products, such as acquisitions and the
operational expansion of manufacturing facilities, and maintenance, such as information technology and research
and development expenditures, as well as investments in regular business activities. Our capital expenditures as a
percentage of sales was equal to 1.9%, 1.6%, and 17.4% in the 2016/2017, 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 Financial
Years (on a combined basis), respectively, and 1.6% and 88.8% in the six months ended March 31, 2019 and
2020 (on a consolidated basis), respectively.

(1) Cash flow from investments for the financial year ended September 30, 2019 includes carve-out related items, specifically the fee paid in
relation to the licensing agreement for the rights to use the thyssenkrupp brand (€1,080 million) and the payments for carve-out related
real estate transfers (€74 million).
(2) Includes the cash flow line items, “Proceeds from disposal of shares in remaining thyssenkrupp Group companies,” “Proceeds from
disposals of investments accounted for using the equity method and non-current financial assets,” “Proceeds from disposals of property,
plant and equipment” and “Proceeds from disposals of intangible assets.”
(3) Includes “Expenditures for acquisitions of consolidated companies net of cash acquired,” “Purchase of investments accounted for using
the equity method and non-financial assets,” “Expenditures for acquisitions of shares in thyssenkrupp ET group companies from
thyssenkrupp Group,” “Cash advances and loans classified as investing activities,” “Capital expenditures for property, plant and
equipment (inclusive of advance payments)” and “Capital expenditures for intangible assets (inclusive of advance payments).”
(4) Because we adopted IFRS 16 on October 1, 2019, IFRS 16 was not applicable during the financial years ended September 30, 2017,
2018 and 2019 or for the six months ended March 30, 2019. The six month period ended March 31, 2020, in which IFRS 16 was adopted
for the first time, excludes €19 million due to carve-out effects for the multifunctional building, Neuhausen, using the modified
accounting treatment. Corresponding cash out has been recognized within carve-out effects in the 2018/2019 Financial Year in the course
of the advance payment.
(5) Capital expenditures for the six months ended March 31, 2020 include €3,340 million in purchase costs paid in connection with the
Reorganization.

Our capital expenditures on a consolidated basis increased by €(3,386) million, from €(60) million in the six
months ended March 31, 2019, to €(3,446) million in the six months ended March 31, 2020. The increase was
primarily driven by acquisitions of shares in the Group companies from the thyssenkrupp Group during the six
months ended March 31, 2020 as part of the legal reorganization of the Group finalized as of December 31, 2019.

Our capital expenditures on a combined basis increased by €(1,268) million, from €(121) million in the
2017/2018 Financial Year to €(1,389) million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year, primarily as a result of the
one-time €1,080 million fee payed in connection with the Licensing Agreement (see “Business—Intellectual
_Property”) and also increased due to expansions and major project expenditure, specifically the acquisitions of_
Nashville Machine Elevator and O’Keefe Elevator Company Inc., and investments in the MULTI elevator
system. Higher information technology and other research and development investment also contributed to the
increase.

Our capital expenditures on a combined basis decreased by €27 million, or 18.2%, from €(148) million in the
2016/2017 Financial Year to €(121) million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year, primarily due to a decrease in
capital expenditures mainly with respect to property, plant and equipment following the finalization of several
major investments in the Asia/Pacific segment, namely manufacturing investments and the new test tower at our
facility in Zhongshan, China.

time to time to fund our working capital needs. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Facilities Agreement” and
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Guarantee Facility Agreement.”

**Contingent Liabilities and Other Financial Commitments**

_Contingencies_

In the past, a holding company in Spain that was part of the thyssenkrupp Group issued certain guarantees on
behalf of other companies within the thyssenkrupp Group to customers of the thyssenkrupp Group who were not
customers of the Elevator Technology Business as well as, in October 2019, to Spanish tax authorities for tax
audits at thyssenkrupp Group companies which do not belong to the elevator technology business that raised the
need to grant a collateral to the Spanish tax authorities. The Spanish holding company has since become part of
the Group. We expect that these guarantees will be either transferred to an entity within the thyssenkrupp Group
but outside of the Group before the Acquisition Closing Date (after which they will no longer be obligations of
the Group) or the thyssenkrupp Group will provide adequate collateralization to the Group. The following table
shows obligations under such guarantees as of the dates indicated.

**As of**

The terms of these guarantees depend on the type of guarantee and may range from three months to five years.
The basis for possible payments under the guarantees is the non-performance of the principal debtor under a
contractual agreement, such as late delivery, delivery of non-conforming goods under a contract or

120


-----

non-performance with respect to the warranted quality as well as a final ruling of the Spanish tax authorities. All
guarantees are issued at the instruction of a combined company of the Group upon the request of the principal
debtor obligated by the underlying contractual relationship and are subject to recourse provisions in the case of
default.

_Material legal disputes_

As of March 31, 2020, we had contingencies for the following material legal disputes:

- A claim by the creditors of a former owner of an acquired business in Brazil for the reversal of the
acquisition in order to access the acquired assets to satisfy claims against the former owner (€48 million);
and

- Private enforcement claims in relation to our participation in elevator cartels in several EU jurisdictions
(€150 million).

For more information on contingent liabilities in relation to existing and potential legal and arbitration actions
and official investigations and proceedings, see Note 20 to the Audited Combined Financial Statements and Note
9 to the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements.

**Off-balance Sheet Arrangements**

We have off-balance sheet items relating to operating leases and sales of receivable transactions. The operating
leases primarily comprise lease contracts for property, plant and equipment in the Americas, Europe/Africa and
Asia/Pacific segments as well as leases for carpooling and real estate within the thyssenkrupp Group. Information
about the exposure to future lease payments resulting from operating leases can be found in Note 20 to the
Audited Combined Financial Statements. Due to the implementation of IFRS 16, operating leases will be
reported on the statement of financial position from the 2019/2020 Financial Year onwards. See Note 2 to the
Audited Combined Financial Statements and Note 1 to the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements
for more information about the application of IFRS 16 by the Group. Finally, we have sales of receivable
transactions which primarily relate to revolving factoring contracts in Spain as well as one-time transactions in
China and Italy. As of March 31, 2020, sales of receivables transactions amounted to €36.9 million, of which
€35.4 million were attributable to the revolving factoring program in Spain.

**Pensions and Post-Retirement Benefits**

We grant current and former employees and their dependents pension and (early) retirement benefits. The
pension benefits are based on various pension plans (e.g., KombiPakt and flexplan, deferred compensation,
legacy plans, etc.) in the form of defined benefit or defined contribution pension plans in various countries. Our
obligations under these plans vary depending on legal, tax and economic circumstances in the various countries
in which we operate, and, in most of the countries, they generally depend on the length of service and
remuneration of the specific employee concerned.

The following amounts are recognized on the statement of financial position for pension and similar obligations
for the periods indicated:

In the case of defined contribution plans, current contributions are recognized as pension expenses of the period
concerned. The total cost of pension plans accounted for as defined contribution plans amounted to €59 million
as of September 30, 2019, €54 million as of September 30, 2018 and €54 million as of September 30, 2017. In
addition, contributions paid to public or state pension insurance institutions amounted to €162 million as of
September 30, 2019, €186 million as of September 30, 2018 and €182 million as of September 30, 2017.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Financial Risk Management**

We are exposed to financial risks in the form of credit risk (default risk), market risk (foreign currency and
interest rate risk) and liquidity risk during the course of our ordinary business activities. Market risk is the risk
that fair values or future cash flows of non-derivative or derivative financial instruments will fluctuate due to
changes in risk factors. Among market risks relevant to our business are foreign currency and interest rate risks.
Associated with these risks are fluctuations in income, equity and cash flow.

The analyses and amounts discussed below that are determined by means of sensitivity analyses represent
hypothetical, future-oriented data that can differ from actual outcomes because of unforeseeable developments in
financial markets. Moreover, non-financial or non-quantifiable risks, such as business risks, are not considered
here. Credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk are described below and in more detail in Note 21 to the Audited
Combined Financial Statements.

**_Credit Risk_**

Credit risk (default risk) is the risk of the Group incurring financial losses due to the non-fulfilment or partial
fulfilment of existing debt obligations. Credit risk management is governed by corporate guidelines. Companies
and business operating activities of the Group are required to implement credit risk management in accordance
with these guidelines.

In order to minimize default risks (credit risks) from the use of financial instruments, we only conclude such
transactions with counterparties that meet our internal minimum requirements. We currently conclude our
financial instruments with thyssenkrupp AG or with financial institutions. After the Acquisition Closing Date, we
expect to conclude new financial instruments with financial institutions only.

We generally manage default risks by requiring suitable advance as well as progress payments. In rare cases
where a credit risk analysis suggests a potentially higher default risk, letters of credit and payment guarantees
from banks, insurance companies and management companies are requested. In order to minimize default risks
from operating activities, our corporate guidelines provide for the assessment of default risk based on the risk
profile of the business partner using suitable internal and, where available, external information, such as ratings
and credit reports, in conjunction with the corresponding estimation of financial risk exposure regarding the
respective business transaction from our perspective. We make a credit decision for each transaction with each
business partner using the aforementioned approach. Considering the individual characteristics of our customer
structures and business models, we lay down clear process rules for determining which measures are to be taken
in the event of a payment default in order to mitigate the maximum default risk as far as possible. Transactions
the value of which exceeds specified materiality thresholds, especially in the area of major sales contracts, also
require prior approval at different management levels within the Group. Among other things, the amount and
hedging of default risks are assessed.

**_Foreign Currency Risk Exposure_**

We are exposed to translation and transactional foreign exchange risks. Translational risk arises when we
translate the financial statements of our subsidiaries which have a functional currency other than our functional
reporting currency, the euro. Transactional risk arises when our subsidiaries execute transactions in a currency
other than their functional currency. In the years ended September 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, 77% of our net sales
were generated by operating subsidiaries with a functional currency (generally the local currency) other than the
euro. In terms of our results of operations, the US dollar, the Chinese renminbi, the Brazilian real, the Canadian
dollar and the South Korean won are the most important foreign currencies, though for the purposes of sensitivity
analysis under IFRS 7, the US dollar is the only relevant risk variable.

Our policy is to continuously monitor such risks through our risk management system. There have been no
significant risk concentrations in the past financial year, as less than 5% of net sales require derivative foreign
currency hedging as of the financial year ended September 30, 2019, of which approximately 75% is linked to
the euro and U.S. dollar. Of our sales for the 2018/2019 Financial Year, 55% were either in euro or U.S. dollar.
Foreign currency hedging is used to fix prices on the basis of hedging rates as protection against any unfavorable
exchange rate fluctuations in the future. Hedging periods are generally based on the maturities of underlying
transactions. Foreign currency derivative contracts usually have maturities of twelve months or less, but can also
be up to six years in exceptional cases.

The U.S. dollar is the only relevant risk variable for sensitivity analyses under IFRS 7, as the vast majority of
foreign currency cash flows occur in U.S. dollars. As hedging transactions are generally used to hedge underlying
transactions, opposite effects in underlying and hedging transactions are almost entirely offset over the total

122


-----

period. Thus, the transactional currency risk exposure results from hedging relationships with off-balance sheet
underlying transactions, i.e., hedges of firm commitments and forecasted sales.

Both the proceeds from the offering of, and the liabilities incurred under, the SSN USD Notes, the SUN USD
Notes and the USD TLB Facility will be denominated in U.S. dollar. We may consider entering into certain
derivative agreements for hedging all or a portion of our exposure to fluctuations in the euro-value of these
liabilities. We have not yet completed our analysis and procedures to determine the accounting treatment of such
potential derivative agreements.

For more information on our foreign currency risk exposure, including a sensitivity analysis, see Note 21 to the
Audited Combined Financial Statements.

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

Interest rate instruments can result in cash flow risks, opportunity effects, as well as interest rate risks affecting
the statement of financial position and earnings. Refinancing and variable-rate financial instruments are subject
to cash flow risk which expresses the uncertainty of future interest payments. We measure cash flow risk by
means of cash flow sensitivity. Opportunity effects arise from non-derivatives, as these are measured at
amortized costs rather than fair value, in contrast to interest derivatives. The difference, the so-called opportunity
effect, affects neither our statement of financial position nor the statement of profit or loss. Opportunity effects
and interest rate risks affecting the statement of financial position and earnings are determined by calculating fair
value sensitivity analyses and changes.

Borrowings under the Senior Facilities, the SSN EUR FRN Notes and the Private Senior Notes will be variable
rate debt. We may consider entering into certain derivative agreements, for hedging all or a portion of our
exposure to fluctuations in the interest rate of these liabilities. We have not yet completed our analysis and
procedures to determine the accounting treatment of such potential derivative agreements.

For more information on our interest rate risk exposure, including a sensitivity analysis, see Note 21 to the
Audited Combined Financial Statements.

**_Liquidity Risk_**

Liquidity risk is the risk that we are unable to meet our existing or future obligations associated with financial
liabilities due to insufficient availability of cash or cash equivalents.

To counter this risk, cash inflows and outflows and due dates are continuously monitored and managed. Cash
requirements are primarily met by cash generated from operations and until the Acquisition Closing Date, will
also be met with borrowings from thyssenkrupp AG and cash in connection with cash management and cash
pooling services performed by thyssenkrupp AG. As of March 31, 2020, on a consolidated basis, we had cash
and cash equivalents of €220 million. Further, we had cash and cash equivalents of €307 million, €256 million
and €313 million, respectively, September 30, 2017, September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2019 on a combined
basis, respectively. As a result, there were no material concentrations of liquidity risk in the period under review.

Following the Transactions, we will mitigate our liquidity risks by rolling liquidity planning, maintaining
adequate liquidity reserves in the form of cash, and by drawing the Revolving Credit Facility. For more
information on our liquidity risk, including future undiscounted cash outflows, see Note 21 to the Audited
Combined Financial Statements.

**Critical Accounting Policies**

The combined financial information presented in our Audited Combined Financial Statements does not
necessarily reflect the net assets, financial position, results of operations and capital structure that would have
occurred if we had existed as a separate, standalone group in the reporting periods under consideration. The fact
that we did not historically exist therefore limits the validity of the combined financial information. It also means
that the combined financial information cannot be used to forecast the future development of the operations that
have been combined to form the Group.

In preparing the Audited Combined Financial Statements, our management made additional assumptions and
estimates, particularly in connection with operating activities to be transferred and allocable expenses for
administrative services provided by remaining thyssenkrupp Group companies. These assumptions and estimates
affect the amounts and the reporting of recognized assets and liabilities, income and expenses and contingent
liabilities. The actual amounts may vary from these estimates.

We apply estimates and judgments by management especially in the following accounting policies.

123


-----

**_Business Combinations_**

As a result of acquisitions, we recognized goodwill in our statement of financial position. In a business
combination, all identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired are recorded at the date of
acquisition at their respective fair value. One of the most significant estimates relates to the determination of the
fair value of these asset and liabilities. Land, buildings and equipment are usually independently appraised while
marketable securities are valued at market price. If any intangible assets are identified, depending on the type of
intangible asset and the complexity of determining our fair value, we either consult with an independent external
valuation expert or develop the fair value internally, using an appropriate valuation technique which is generally
based on a forecast of the total expected future net cash flows. These evaluations are linked closely to the
assumptions made by management regarding the future performance of the assets concerned and any changes in
the discount rate applied.

**_Recoverability of Goodwill_**

We test annually, and also when any indicators exist, whether goodwill has suffered an impairment loss. If there
is an indication, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit has to be estimated, which is the greater of
the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. The determination of the value in use involves making
assumptions and estimates related to the projection and discounting of future cash flows. See Note 4 to the
Audited Combined Financial Statements. Although management believes the assumptions used to calculate
recoverable amounts are appropriate, any unforeseen changes in these assumptions could result in impairment
charges to goodwill, which could adversely affect the future financial position and operating results.

**_Recoverability of Assets_**

At each balance sheet date, we assess whether there is any indication that the carrying amounts of our property,
plant and equipment, investment property or intangible assets may be impaired. If any such indication exists, we
estimate the recoverable amount of the asset. The recoverable amount is the greater of the fair value less costs to
sell and the value in use. In assessing the value in use, we have to determine discounted future cash flows from
the related assets. Estimating the discounted future cash flows involves significant assumptions, including
particularly those regarding future sale prices and sale volumes, costs and discount rates. See Notes 4 and 5 to the
Audited Combined Financial Statements. Although management believes that our estimates of the relevant
expected useful lives, our assumptions concerning the economic environment and developments in the industries
in which we operate and our estimations of the discounted future cash flows are appropriate, changes in the
assumptions or circumstances could require changes in the analysis. This could lead to additional impairment
charges in the future or to reversal of impairments if the trends identified by management reverse or the
assumptions or estimates prove incorrect.

**_Other Provisions_**

The recognition and measurement of other provisions are based on the estimation of the probability of a future
outflow of resources as well as empirical values and the circumstances known at the reporting date. This means
that the actual later outflow of resources may differ from the other provisions. See Note 15 to the Audited
Combined Financial Statements.

**_Revenue Recognition from Contracts with Customers_**

Certain entities of the Group report some of their business transactions as construction contracts, in which sales
are recognized over time using the percentage-of-completion method. This method requires accurate estimates of
the extent of progress towards completion. Depending on the methodology to determine contract progress, the
significant estimates include total contract costs, remaining costs to completion, total contract sales, contract
risks and other judgments. The managements of the operating companies continually review all estimates
involved in such contraction contracts and adjust them as necessary.

The expected variable consideration amount is estimated at the inception of a contract with a customer. The
estimate is made using either the probability-weighted expected value or the most likely amount. The estimation
method giving the better forecast for the respective contract is always used. The variable consideration amount
estimated at contract inception is reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted as necessary.

In the case of contracts with customers which have distinct performance obligations, the required allocation of
the transaction price to the distinct performance obligations is carried out by reference to the relative standalone
selling prices. The relative standalone selling prices used generally correspond to directly observable market

124


-----

prices at which we separately sell the performance obligations to other customers. If the standalone selling price
is not directly observable, we make a best estimate of the standalone selling price. In these cases, we use an
adjusted market assessment approach, an expected cost plus a margin approach, or a residual approach.

**_Income Taxes_**

The recognition and measurement of current and deferred tax receivables and liabilities depend on management
estimates of tax uncertainties and future business performance. These include both the interpretation of existing
tax regulations and the testing of deferred tax assets for impairment. We adjust these estimates when there is
sufficient evidence of the need for such adjustment.

**_Employee Benefits_**

We account for pension and other post-retirement benefits in accordance with actuarial valuations. These
valuations rely on statistical and other factors in order to anticipate future events. These factors include key
actuarial assumptions including the discount rate, expected salary increases, mortality rates and health care cost
trend rates. These actuarial assumptions may differ materially from actual developments due to changing market
and economic conditions and therefore may result in a significant change in post-retirement employee benefit
obligations, of equity and the related future expense. See Note 14 to the Audited Combined Financial Statements
for further information.

**_Legal Contingencies_**

Various entities within the Group are party to litigations related to a number of matters as described in greater
detail in “Business—Legal Proceedings.” The outcome of these matters may have a material effect on the
financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Management regularly analyzes current information about
these matters and provides provisions for probable contingent losses including the estimate of legal expense to
resolve the matters. For the assessments, internal and external lawyers are used. In making the decision regarding
the need for loss provisions, management considers the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the

**Overview of the Elevator and Escalator Market**

We are primarily active in the elevator and escalator market (referred to as “E&E”). The E&E market is worth
approximately €56 billion (excluding Japan) according to the Market Size/Growth Analysis, and there are
approximately 16 million elevators and escalators installed globally, with more than 900,000 new units installed
each year. The E&E market encompasses (i) elevators for office buildings, apartment buildings, shopping
centers, hotels, hospitals, train and metro stations, airports and other similar applications and (ii) escalators and
moving walks with the ability to handle heavy traffic and frequent use utilized in a broad range of applications. A
mixture of global, pure play elevator and escalator manufacturers, industrial conglomerates with elevator and
escalator divisions and smaller regional and local companies make up the competitive landscape of the elevator
and escalator market. For buyers of elevator and escalator products, key purchasing criteria include price (in
particular for new installation tenders), customer relationships, brand reputation, operational scale, cost of
ownership, terms of maintenance and repair services, efficiency and innovative product offerings. With a
relatively fragmented, localized customer base and a diverse regulatory environment, local expertise is important
to obtain both new installation and recurring service contracts.

Elevators are typically divided into high-, mid- and low-rise categories, with varying regulatory and technical
requirements. High-rise units generally serve commercial applications above 100 meters. Mid-rise units usually
serve commercial or public projects with a height of 45-100 meters. Low-rise units mostly serve residential
projects under 45 meters. Due to regional differences in product demand and regulation, elevator and escalator
products from a manufacturer may also differ depending on the location of the intended customer.

Within the elevator and escalator market, there are generally three discrete lines of business driven by the product
lifecycle and customer relationship: New Installation, Services and Modernizations. After their initial
manufacture and installation, elevators and escalators require continuous maintenance throughout their lifespan
before requiring varying levels of modernization. The graphic below illustrates the typical sales lifecycle for an
original equipment manufacturer (OEM) alongside the customer relationship for an elevator or escalator:

**_New Installation_**

The New Installation business encompasses the sale of new equipment and the associated manufacturing,
delivery and installation at the desired site. The market for new installations of elevator and escalator projects is
driven by demand from the broader construction industry. It is therefore largely project-based and often subject

to a competitive tender process, and selection by developers or contractors will depend on a number of factors,
including budget, technical specifications and service offerings post-installation. In connection with the new
installation tender process, OEMs also seek to secure longer-term, recurring service contracts for installed units.
OEMs term this the conversion process, and often measure their performance in part based on their conversion
rate of New Installations units to Service contracts. New Installation business is therefore an important driver for
growth of the Service business. OEMs also consistently work to increase the efficiency of their manufacturing
supply chain. Components may be sourced from third-party suppliers or produced in-house depending on the
level of complexity and customization required. Whereas in the past a large share of the components were often
manufactured in-house by the OEM itself, there has been a trend in the industry to outsource a larger range of
components, such as elevator doors, to third-party suppliers. This has reduced the complexity of the production
process for OEMs as their factory sites increasingly shift from deep manufacturing to component configuration.

Once manufactured, elevators are typically shipped in pieces and assembled on site, whereas escalators are
typically assembled in the factory and shipped as a complete product. Installation may be completed by an
OEM’s own employees or outsourced to sub-contractors.

Additionally, producers attract business through technology and innovation that reduces product downtime and
fulfills other buyer requirements. For instance, energy-saving technologies can help buyers reach sustainability
goals for their projects and advanced destination controls can increase the number of passengers able to be
dispatched per hour. Furthermore, recent developments in IoT technology, such as real-time diagnosis and
reporting of events by the elevator itself to an OEM’s service center, present an attractive proposition to New
Installations buyers with the prospect of more efficient service during the lifetime of the elevator or escalator and
enhanced contract retention for OEMs.

**_Service_**


The Service business involves the full range of steps required to properly maintain an elevator or escalator
throughout its usable life and is mission-critical in nature. For business owners, regular service of elevators and
escalators is essential to maintain consistent uptime and safety of users in their facilities. Furthermore, elevators
and escalators are subject to broad and sometimes diverse sets of regulations and safety standards across
jurisdictions which typically require maintenance on elevators and escalators by licensed service professionals in
certain intervals. In addition, Service customers are often property owners who are able to pass through
maintenance costs to tenants, making them somewhat less price sensitive when choosing a Service provider.

Based on long-term customer relationships through service contracts, the Service business can provide recurring
and reliable sales streams to Service providers at higher margins than the New Installation business. Service
providers as a result are able to achieve a higher degree of visibility into resilient and recurring future earnings
through the elevator or escalator lifecycle, as illustrated by the graphic below:

Time


Service agreements tend to fall into one of three categories based on service scope: full maintenance, partial
maintenance and oil & grease. Terms of service agreements may vary by jurisdiction and customer, but often last
one to five years. Depending on the scope of the service agreement, the Service provider may charge a flat fee for
regular maintenance and on an individual invoice basis for additional repairs and spare parts. Usually, the OEM
of the elevator or escalator product has an advantage in winning a service contract for its own products.
Participants in the elevator and escalator market however also have the ability to service the products of third
parties, provided they have the required technical expertise internally available. This can be a further valuable
revenue stream for Service providers at various points throughout a product’s lifecycle as contracts come up for
renewal.

127


-----

While the elevator and escalator Service business is primarily local in its operation, Service providers benefit
from greater scale as they are able to maintain more competitive cost structures, network density and
technological leadership. Having a dense network of service branches with technicians trained on all types of
elevator and escalator units enables providers to increase their market coverage and further solidify their brand
reputation. Greater scale also allows for operational efficiencies such as faster sourcing of spare parts.

Moreover, recent technological advancements, such as those in the IoT landscape, allow Service providers with
global reach to further benefit from their scale as they are able to develop efficient service solutions based on
their deep experience in the field across regions. IoT solutions include real-time diagnosis and reporting of events
by the elevator itself to a Service provider’s service center, which can reduce product downtime, add value for
the Service customer and make service technicians more efficient. The advantages of IoT-powered maintenance
solutions have the potential to not only improve an OEM’s conversion rate from New Installations units to
recurring service contracts, they also help ensure customer retention over the long-term.

**_Modernization_**

As an elevator or escalator ages, it requires increasing amounts of maintenance to operate efficiently and
maintain compliance with local regulations. Maintenance expenses for older systems also tend to increase as
spare parts become outdated and therefore less common. Modernization helps solve these issues by providing
customers with a range of options to prolong the usable life of an elevator or escalator system and postpone a
more capital-intensive full replacement. With the age of the installed base of escalators and elevators generally
increasing across regions, Modernizations represent a further source of recurring revenue alongside the New
Installation and Service businesses.

Modernizations can range from the replacement or upgrade of a single component (such as a traction machine) to
the exchange of an entire system within a building (with a result akin to a New Installations project). OEMs seek
to win modernization work from both existing Service customers and from new customers. Many modernization
providers have the ability to modernize third-party elevator or escalator systems in addition to their own systems,
representing opportunities to expand their installed base.

The large and aging global installed base means that OEMs have the potential to derive significant recurring
revenues from modernization customers. Moreover, OEMs have the potential to convert the modernized units
into service contracts, increasing their number of units under maintenance.

Note: Historical numbers FX-adjusted. Excludes Japan

There are approximately 16 million elevators and escalators currently installed globally, and over 900,000 new
elevators and escalators are being installed each year, supported by an estimated increase in growth in China and
ongoing growth in construction activity driving New Installations.

Today, the global population, and in particular the urban population, continues to grow. More than 200,000
people move to cities each day (Source: United Nations, 2018). By 2050, the number of urban inhabitants is
expected to increase by 55%, from approximately 4 billion today to nearly 7 billion (Source: United Nations,
2018). Within cities there is an increasing demand for better access and convenience, renovation activity of
existing infrastructure, new large-scale infrastructure and urban living projects and demand for innovative
products. As elevators and escalators are an inherent component of the residential and commercial multi-story
buildings that characterize urban environments, this will drive structural growth for the elevator and escalator
market. The elevator and escalator New Installations market is forecast to grow at a 1.7% CAGR between 2019
and 2024, driven in part by solid global macroeconomic output and construction output (source: Market Size/
Growth Analysis). Based on forecasts incorporating the COVID-19 impact, global residential construction
spending is expected to decline by 1.5% in 2020 (compared to +1.9% growth expected pre-COVID-19 outbreak)
and global non-residential construction is expected to decline by 1.7% (compared to +1.5% growth expected
pre-COVID-19 outbreak) (source: IHS). The medium term outlook remains positive with global residential
spending projected to grow at a 1.7% CAGR 19-24E and non-residential structures spending projected to
increase at a 1.6% CAGR 19-24E (source: IHS).

The elevator and escalator Service market is also forecast to outpace the greater global market with a 3.9%
CAGR between 2019 and 2024, driven by increasing regulatory requirements and customer demands for safety
and convenience as well as appreciation of service quality. This is particularly relevant in highly regulated and
developed markets such as North America and Europe, with an ageing installed base. The elevator and escalator
market is subject to a variety of laws and regulations which require the owners of elevator and escalator systems
to invest in maintenance to ensure their systems are operating safely. The need for maintenance of a growing
installed base is expected to fuel Service growth. In addition, the elevator and escalator modernization market is
forecast to grow at a 6.9% CAGR between 2019 and 2024. As the installed base of elevators and escalators ages,
property owners increasingly need to invest in modernization of their elevators and escalators to further ensure
they comply with applicable regulatory requirements and continue to operate safely and efficiently.

The trend towards sophisticated IoT solutions and general digitalization of transportation technologies is also
estimated to support growth in the elevator and escalator Service market, as customers across regions demand
increasing levels of service quality and uptime from their products. The availability of big data from elevators
and escalators in real time allows OEMs to improve their Service offerings and increase the retention of their
customers. Furthermore, new concepts in urbanization and architecture require innovative new elevator and
escalator products that can increase usable space, passenger capacity and safety. Rope-less, multidirectional
elevators (such as our MULTI elevator) are presenting architects and urban planners with new opportunities for
building and infrastructure design.

In addition, during the 2009 global financial crises, the elevator and escalator market delivered favorable growth
rates and in particular, delivered more favorable returns than the broader industrial segment, demonstrating the
resilience of the elevator and escalator market, as illustrated by the figures below:

Modernization businesses, which together accounted for 54% of sales and around 70% of gross profit in the
2018/2019 Financial Year, are a source of stable, recurring sales and high profit margins for the Group, which
provides visibility on future earnings. Driven by our high conversion rate and high retention rates, we have been
able to maintain longstanding customer relationships. Given our global reach and high level of diversification,
our top ten customers in aggregate typically account for less than 3% of our annual revenue.

We have two core divisions and four operating segments, which are part of our reporting segments in accordance
with IFRS 8: Americas, Europe/Africa, Asia/Pacific and Access Solutions (together, our “Operating Segments”)
through which we conduct our customer-facing business activities. Our first core division is the new installation,
service and modernization of elevators, escalators and moving walks (the “Elevator and Escalator division”). Our
second core division is the new installation, service and modernization of access solutions for airports and homes
(the “Access Solutions division”).

The Elevator and Escalator division is divided into three Operating Segments based on geography, which enables
each to tailor its products to the specific customer needs and legal and regulatory requirements in its local markets:

- _Americas:_ Our Americas segment covers our Elevator and Escalator division’s activities in the Americas
and is sub-divided into two further regional units, including North America, covering the United States and
Canada, and Latin America, covering Brazil as the main Latin American sales area and Spanish Latin
America. Our Americas segment contributed €3,306 million, or 41%, of the Operating Segments’ total sales
and €489 million, or 51%, of the Operating Segments’ Adjusted EBIT in the 2018/2019 Financial Year.

- _Europe/Africa:_ Our Europe/Africa segment covers our Elevator and Escalator division’s activities in
Europe and Africa and operates within a widely diverse set of geographical areas through five operational
units: “DACH,” comprising Germany, Austria and Switzerland, “RET,” comprising Russia, Eastern Europe
and Turkey, “FRANCE,” comprising France and Monaco, “BBNI,” comprising the Benelux countries,
Britain, the Nordics and Italy and “IBA,” comprising Spain, Portugal, Angola and Morocco and, through
distributors, certain African countries. Our Europe/Africa segment contributed €2,149 million, or 26%, of
the Operating Segments’ total sales and €227 million, or 24%, of the Operating Segments’ Adjusted EBIT
in the 2018/2019 Financial Year.

- _Asia/Pacific:_ Our Asia/Pacific segment covers our Elevator and Escalator division’s activities in the Asia/
Pacific region and is organized in six operational units: China, South Korea, India, Australia/New Zealand,
Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Our Asia/Pacific segment contributed €2,307 million, or 28%, of the
Operating Segments’ total sales and €178 million, or 19%, of the Operating Segments’ Adjusted EBIT in
the 2018/2019 Financial Year.

Our Access Solutions division operates across all geographies and constitutes our fourth Operating Segment. It
employs a number of different sales strategies and distribution channels, catering to both the business-to-business
and business-to-consumer markets. The Access Solutions division accounted for 5% of the Operating Segments’
total sales and 6% of the Operating Segments’ Adjusted EBIT in the 2018/2019 Financial Year.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

**_Well-established player with a leading global position_**

We hold the top four market position in the global elevator and escalator market (excluding Japan) based on
revenues in the 2017/2018 Financial Year. Our Elevator and Escalator division is divided into three geographical
segments, the Americas, Europe/Africa and Asia/Pacific, which comprise the majority of elevator and escalator
markets worldwide. Based on revenue in the 2017/2018 Financial Year, we hold the number two position in the
Americas, our most profitable elevator and escalator region, the number four position in Europe/Africa, which
has the largest service business by value globally, and the number five position in Asia/Pacific, the world’s
largest new installations market. As of March 31, 2020, we had 1.4 million units under maintenance across the
globe.

The following graph shows our market position in the elevator and escalator market (excluding Japan) based on
sales in the 2017/2018 Financial Year:

Otis Schindler Kone thyssenkrupp Elevator Mitsubishi Hitachi Hyundai Fujitec Toshiba

We believe that our status as a global leader in the elevator and escalator industry is attributable to our
particularly strong and far-reaching service network, our track record of high profile infrastructure projects, and
our offering of products and services across the life cycle of elevators and escalators, from new installation to
service to modernization. In addition, we believe that our expertise in the manufacturing and provision of spare
parts, along with our network of specialists and a strong and globally recognized German engineering heritage,
have resulted in a particularly high ranking among our peers with regards to competency of our field force, which
in conjunction with our innovation technology, are what we believe to be the primary purchasing criteria for
customers and puts us in a position of strength relative to our peers. Our strong market position is also driven by
our offering of some of the most innovative and cutting-edge elevator solutions in the world, such as our MAX
technology (“MAX”), our cloud-based maintenance tool, which utilizes Internet of Things (“IoT”) technologies
to collect data on installed units and make recommendations for repairs in real time, making it immensely
valuable to our Service business. In addition, we are in the process of developing the innovative MULTI elevator
system (“MULTI”), a rope-less elevator able to move both vertically and horizontally.

**_Highly resilient business model across cycles through service focused-business and balanced global footprint_**

We have developed a business model that we believe is stable, balanced and resilient through economic cycles,
and therefore, well-positioned for sustainable, long-term value generation, as demonstrated by our strong longterm historical growth. We have delivered resilient sales and Adjusted EBIT margins since the 2007/2008
Financial Year. Despite negative currency effects in recent financial years, our sales have increased from
€7,674 million in the 2016/2017 Financial Year to €8,048 million in the twelve months ended March 31, 2020,
highlighting the stability of our business and our ability to maintain our sales and profitability over the economic
cycle despite external pressures.

The main driver of the resilience and stability of our overall business is the life cycle of our business model. Our
New Installation business is a key driver of our growing installed base and units under maintenance and therefore
is the entry gate to our Service and Modernization business. The Service business generates revenue streams that
include fees for regular maintenance and income from repairs and spare parts. The strong profitability and the

136


-----

asset-light character of our Service business contribute to our high cash generation. For the 2016/2017,
2017/2018 and 2018/2019 Financial Years, 70% to 80% of our New Installation units converted into Service
units. In each of the 2016/2017, 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 Financial Years, the Service business maintained a
global retention rate of over 90%. Many of our Service business customers eventually become customers of our
Modernization business, which offers us the opportunity to generate revenue from retrofitting or replacing entire
systems of elevators and escalators while continuing the customer relationship. In addition, we attract many
Service customers whose elevator and escalator systems were manufactured and installed by third parties, adding
to our steady Service and Modernization revenue streams.

The high resilience of our business is also driven by a diversified customer base with long-term contracts and
high customer retention rates and a balanced global footprint, minimizing both customer and geographic
concentration risks. Our top ten customers accounted for less than 3% of sales in each of the 2016/2017,
2017/2018 and 2018/2019 Financial Years. Geographically, our elevator and escalator operations (including
manufacturing facilities, service centers and employees) are divided across three Operating Segments: the
Americas, Europe/Africa and Asia/Pacific, which accounted for 41%, 26% and 28% of our Operating Segment’s
total sales, respectively, in the twelve months ended March 31, 2020. Our fourth Operating Segment, the Access
Solutions division, operates globally and generated 5% of our Operating Segments’ total sales for the same
period.

The resilience of our business model is demonstrated by our financial performance during periods of worldwide
economic distress. For example, during the global financial crisis, our total Adjusted EBIT margin and sales
remained stable between the 2008/2009 Financial Year and the 2009/2010 Financial Year. Most recently, we
have been able to successfully manage and limit the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business by
having immediately implemented contingency measures, which we believe further proves the resilience of our
business model through the economic cycles. See “Recent Developments—Coronavirus (COVID-19).”

**_Highly attractive industry with structural growth drivers_**

We operate in the global elevator and escalator market, which generated sales of €55.8 billion in 2019 worldwide
(excluding Japan). The global elevator and escalator market grew at a CAGR of 1.7% between 2014 and 2019,
and prior to taking into account the impact of COVID-19, was expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.3% between
2019 and 2024, above expected real GDP growth. Specifically, between 2019 and 2024, the new installation,
service and modernization businesses were expected to grow at a CAGR of 1.7%, 3.9% and 6.9%, respectively.
This growth is underpinned by structural factors and megatrends, including increasing urbanization, an aging
population, a supportive regulatory environment and sustainability and digitalization trends.

Increasing urbanization is one of the primary drivers for the need for more urban spaces worldwide, which
increases demand for elevators and escalators, as they are an inherent component of the residential and
commercial multi-story buildings that characterize urban environments. By 2050, the number of urban
inhabitants is expected to increase by 55%, from approximately four billion today to nearly seven billion. In
particular, the urban population is expected to increase in emerging markets, including from approximately 60%
in 2018 to 80% in 2050 in China. This trend positively affects the growth of the elevator and escalator market, as
urban residents increasingly demand the access and convenience provided by elevators and escalators,
particularly in cities in the developed world where large-scale urban living and infrastructure projects (such as
hospitals, shopping malls and train stations) are increasingly required to offer fast and efficient urban mobility
solutions.

Growth in the elevator and escalator market is also driven by an increasingly aging population. The ratio of
people over the age of 65 years to those under the age of five years is expected to rise from approximately 1:1 in
2019 to 2:1 in 2050. This trend is likely to support demand for elevator and escalator solutions as well as home
access solutions for stairs, as the growing aging population will need or prefer the mobility afforded by elevators,
escalators and home access solutions.

In addition, growth in the elevator and escalator market is driven by a supportive regulatory environment, which
requires the owners of elevator and escalator systems to invest in basic maintenance services to ensure their
systems are consistently operating safely. Currently, over 50% of elevators in North America and Europe are
over 20 years old. As the installed base of elevators and escalators grows and ages, property owners are
increasingly in need of modernizing their elevators and escalators to ensure they comply with applicable
regulatory requirements and continue to operate safely. In Asia/Pacific, including China and South Korea, we
believe that there is a particularly strong opportunity to grow our Service and Modernization businesses driven
by the aging of the installed base in those markets and stricter safety regulations requiring regular maintenance
and upgrades.

137


-----

We believe that long-term growth in the elevator and escalator market will also be positively impacted by a
continued focus on digitalization, connectivity and sustainability, as customers increasingly value features such
as improved energy efficiency and enhanced safety and maintenance monitoring. According to the Market Size/
_Growth Analysis, the market for buildings with digitally automated operations or “smart buildings” is expected to_
grow at 5% per annum through 2024. We believe that our current innovative smart mobility solutions and our
strong research and development capabilities position us to benefit from this demand. For example, our TWIN
elevator system (“TWIN”), which combines two independent cars in one shaft, can already reduce energy costs
by up to 25% and increase usable floor space by up to 25%. In addition we estimate that our MULTI system,
which we are in the process of developing and will be the world’s first rope-free elevator, will allow for space
reductions of up to a further 30% to 50% compared to our TWIN system. We aim to consistently increase
product efficiency and provide additional value-add to our customers across our portfolio of new and existing
products and services.

**_A leader in technology and innovation in the elevator and escalator market_**

We believe that we are a leading innovator in the elevator and escalator market, offering disruptive innovation
and transformative digital solutions. We have been able to successfully monetize IoT and digital opportunities, as
demonstrated by our recently developed MAX technology and our proprietary IT system, VIEW. MAX is a
cloud-based maintenance tool which utilizes IoT technologies to collect data relating to customer elevator units
and make diagnostic recommendations, such as when repairs need to be undertaken or which critical parts need
to be replaced. VIEW is an operational business steering tool, which, among other things, automatically
dispatches qualified technicians to resolve the problems identified by MAX, often even before any visible
operational issues occur. Leveraging our expertise in IoT and other digital tools enables us to improve customer
satisfaction by increasing service quality and efficiency, thereby increasing our customer retention rates and
decreasing cancellation rates.

In addition, we believe that we have created some of the most innovative elevator concepts currently in operation
in the market. We are the only supplier in the industry to have an offering similar to our TWIN elevator system,
which combines two independent cars in one shaft. We are also currently in the process of developing the
MULTI system, which would be the world’s first rope-free elevator, allowing for space reductions of up to a
further 30% to 50% compared to our TWIN system. These systems offer customers greater space efficiency and
architectural flexibility than conventional designs, making us an attractive choice for a customer base that is
increasingly demanding more innovative elevator and escalator products.

**_Strong financial profile with significant operational improvement opportunity._**

We have a track record of long-term stable sales growth, high cash flow generation and high earnings visibility
on recurring future earnings driven by a ten- to 20-year elevator life cycle with a retention rate of over 90%. Our
Elevator and Escalator division has grown consistently over the years, with our Adjusted EBIT margin generally
increasing since the 2011/2012 Financial Year until the 2016/2017 Financial Year. While facing some
headwinds, especially from material price developments and trade tariffs implemented in recent years, we believe
that, following the Transactions, there will be greater opportunity to increase our Adjusted EBIT margin.

Our business benefits from high revenue visibility given the recurring and stable nature of our Service and
Modernization business model. Our New Installation business represents the key enabler for growth of Service
and Modernization by growing our units under maintenance and offering high visibility of future business
performance due to long order-to-fulfilment times. Most of our New Installation units are converted into
maintenance units, which propels our Service business. Our Service contracts on average have a gross profit
margin of approximately 40%, which progressively increases over the elevator’s lifetime due to increased spare
parts sales. Many of our Service business customers eventually become customers of our Modernization
business, driven by an aging installed base with the need to upgrade and extend the life cycle of the elevators and
escalators. The Service and Modernization businesses, which together accounted for 54% of sales and around
70% of gross profit for the 2018/2019 Financial Year, are a source of stable, recurring sales and high profit
margins for the Group. Our Service contracts have an average length between one to five years. Our full life
cycle business model, with our high conversion and retention rates across businesses and long-term customer
relationships, enables high visibility on recurring future earnings.

The profitability of our business is also driven by our fully invested global foothold, which requires limited
capital expenditure and working capital given our asset-light business model, resulting in a strong cash flow
profile. Our elevator technology business has significantly increased cash generation since 2011/2012, roughly
doubling its business cash flow through generating higher profits and reducing operating net working capital by
approximately 80%. Our cash conversion rate was approximately 90% in the 2018/2019 Financial Year.
Excluding certain one-off expenditures incurred from time to time (such as €3 million, €6 million and €106
million for major mergers and acquisition projects in the 2016/2017, 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 Financial Years
(including the acquisitions of Nashville Machine’s elevator division and O’Keefe Elevator Company, Inc.) as
well as carve-out related one-time expenditures of €1,080 million paid in connection with the Licensing
Agreement fee for use of the “thyssenkrupp” brand and of €74 million for carve-out related real estate transfers,
in both cases, in the 2018/2019 Financial Year), our capital expenditures were €145 million, €115 million, and
€129 million for the 2016/2017 Financial Year, the 2017/2018 Financial Year and the 2018/2019 Financial Year,
respectively, highlighting our generally stable and relatively limited capital investment requirements. See
“Summary Financial and Other Data—Other Financial, Operating and Pro Forma Information—Other
_Financial and Operating Information.” We believe that the development of business cash flow and cash_
conversion over the last three financial years demonstrates that we operate an asset-light business with relatively
low capital requirements and high cash returns.

In addition, we believe our business offers significant operational improvement potential and profitability upside.
We have recently implemented several cost optimization initiatives that we believe will generate greater margins.
For example, we have restructured our manufacturing operations by optimizing our footprint and leveraging
shared services and best practices, as well as streamlining our product offerings. These initiatives have led to
stable development in cost of goods sold by partially offsetting personnel cost inflation through efficiency
measures and headcount management, and compensating for material cost increases through purchasing
measures and the improved management of procurement volume. These efficiency measures have also reduced
SG&A costs as a percentage of sales from 18.5% in the 2016/2017 Financial Year to 16.4% in the twelve months
ended March 31, 2020. In addition, following the Acquisition, we expect to realize an additional estimated
€240 million in potential cost savings within 15 to 18 months after July 1, 2020 as part of the Sponsors’
transformation program (the “Transformation Program”). See “—Our Strategies—Core Strategy: Realize
_structural profitability upside” and “Summary Financial and Other Data—Other Financial, Operating and Pro-_
_Forma Information—Other Pro Forma Information.”_


**_Highly experienced and execution focused management team_**

We are led by an experienced, entrepreneurial management team that is committed to continuing our strong track
record of growth, with a focus on product quality, customer service and delayering. Peter Walker, the Group’s
chief executive officer, began his career as an entrepreneur and has more than 25 years’ experience in the
elevator industry. Among other achievements, he was instrumental, as chief executive officer of Asia/Pacific, to
the successful establishment of the Group’s footprint in Asia/Pacific, where he helped drive increases in revenue
and profitability and is credited with turning around the then loss-making South Korea business. Mr. Walker
served as the Group’s chief operating officer before being appointed chief executive officer in 2019. Ercan Keles
has served as the Group’s chief financial officer for eight years and has previously served in various positions for
entities in the thyssenkrupp Group and externally for more than 13 years. Mr. Keles has been key to driving the
Group’s profitability and cost efficiency measures in recent years. Dr. Detlef Hunsdiek, the Company’s chief
human resources officer, has deep restructuring experience and is responsible for rolling out the Group’s
efficiency programs across its global network. In addition to our senior executive team, our business benefits


139


-----

from our experienced and dedicated local management teams, including the chief executive officers of our
business units, who each have a deep understanding of the elevator and escalator market and geographic
expertise. Together, our management team has successfully grown our business to become the fourth-largest
elevator and escalator company globally (excluding Japan) and increased our sales from €7,674 million in the
2016/2017 Financial Year to €8,048 million in the twelve months ended March 31, 2020.

We have operated largely as an independent company while under thyssenkrupp AG’s ownership. Our
management team, which is strategically positioned around the globe, has maintained responsibility for the
continued operational excellence of our company while under thyssenkrupp AG and has succeeded in improving
performance during that time. Following the completion of the Acquisition, we also expect our business to
benefit from the market expertise, business relationships, knowledge and experience of the Sponsors. Advent and
Cinven have strong expertise and an extensive and successful track record of investing in the industrials and
business services sectors and in carve-out transactions, particularly in Germany, where each of them have had a
presence for more than 20 years and successfully invested individually in more than 39 companies. Worldwide,
Advent and Cinven have invested in 130 companies in the industrials and business services sectors, further
demonstrating considerable experience in the relevant markets. For example, Advent has successfully invested in
Laird, Innio, Allnex, Cobham and Rubix in the industrials sector, Nets and Hune in the business services sector
and Walmart Brasil and Innio in carve-out transactions, while the Cinven Funds have successfully invested in
CeramTec, SLV, and Tractel in the industrials sector, Envirotainer, JLA and Barentz in the business services
sector and CeramTec, Ufinet and Viridium in carve-out transactions. Advent and Cinven also have a strong track
record in successfully executing value creation plans.

In addition, it is expected that thyssenkrupp AG or one or more of its affiliates will invest in an indirect parent
company of Bidco, retaining a minority interest of approximately 19% in the Group. Such shareholding
percentage is indicative and may be subject to variation.

**Our Strategies**

We aim to deliver strong growth in our business, including significant margin expansion, through our three key
strategies, Base, Core, and Core+, as further discussed below.

**_Base Strategy: Continue to capitalize on our market position and structural growth_**

Our Base strategy consists of leveraging the structural factors that drive growth in the market in which we
operate, together with our leading position in those markets, to grow our business and increase our profitability.

As one of the world’s leading elevator and escalator companies, we aim to manufacture and install a substantial
portion of the new elevators and escalators expected to be installed worldwide in the coming years. As a result of
our global scale and strong brand recognition in the market, we believe there is significant sales potential for our
New Installation business and continued growth opportunities for increasing our units under maintenance,
resulting in further revenue and profit generation in our key markets.

In addition, we target continued growth in all our business segments by leveraging structural factors such as an
aging population, global urbanization and stricter safety requirements driving demand for maintenance and
modernization services. In particular, we believe that our Service and Modernization businesses are positioned
for growth as the installed base of elevators and escalators grows and ages.

In the Americas, we target growth in our New Installation business, driven by expected growth in the US
construction sector and our strength in meeting customer demands for efficient execution and technical
excellence, such as our expertise in the hydraulic segment. We target growth in our Service business due to
customer demand for high quality services with short lead times, and through reducing cancellation rates and
winning service contracts for third-party installations. We also target growth in both our Service and
Modernization businesses driven by increases in the average age of the installed base of elevators and escalators
in the region and a strict regulatory environment.

In Europe/Africa, we expect that the large, aging installed base of elevators and escalators, supported by a strict
regulatory environment and high customer retention and conversion rates, will generate attractive service and
modernization opportunities. We further expect that strong construction output, particularly from the residential
segment and a slight recovery in Southern Europe as well as a more competitive product offering due to our
manufacturing optimization initiatives in Spain and Germany, will drive our New Installation business and,
consequently, growth in our Service and Modernization businesses.

140


-----

In Asia/Pacific, we aim to benefit from the anticipated growth of the new installations market, targeting robust
expansion of our New Installation business, including in India and other markets. We believe that growing
customer demand for high quality services and an expanding installed base will also contribute to growth in our
Service and Modernization businesses. We expect that an expanding installed base of elevators and escalators
and the growing importance of IoT solutions, particularly in South Korea, will lead to strong growth
opportunities in our Service and Modernization businesses. We expect China, the largest elevator and escalator
market in Asia, will continue to generate our highest New Installation growth globally, and that conversion of
many of these newly installed units to Service contracts will continue to drive growth in the Service business. We
believe that there is a particularly strong opportunity to grow our Service and Modernization businesses in China
and other developing markets, driven by the growth and the aging of the installed base in those markets and
stricter safety regulations requiring regular maintenance and upgrades, which many emerging market countries
are adopting as their regulatory systems mature.

**_Core Strategy: Realize structural profitability upside_**

Our Core strategy consists of realizing structural profitability upside by focusing on (i) standardization within our
New Installation business, (ii) manufacturing optimization, (iii) service and modernization growth and
digitalization, (iv) selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) cost reduction and (v) procurement
optimization. In addition, following the Acquisition, we expect to realize additional cost savings as part of the
Sponsors’ Transformation Program.

_Standardization of Our New Installation Business_

We plan to continue to drive the standardization of our New Installation business by simplifying the amount and
types of products and components we offer our customers.

Historically, in part due to our strategy of growing through acquisitions, we provided customers with a large
share of customized product solutions. This resulted in a highly diverse but overlapping product portfolio and
limited price competitiveness due to the high costs of designing and producing such a wide range of
individualized products. In order to optimize our structure, we are in the process of simplifying our regional
product portfolio and standardizing certain components. For example, the number of product platforms in the
Group has been reduced by more than half in the last decade as part of a process of implementing a simplified
portfolio structure with further improvements planned going forward. In Europe, we have streamlined our major
platforms down to two, which cover 80% of our products. This has resulted in synergies and a strong evolution of
order intake in the first half of 2019/2020 while not impacting customers’ perception of our product offering or
quantity of sales. We believe this will lead us to benefit from economies of scales, focusing our resource
allocation more efficiently and allowing us to provide a more cost-competitive offering without compromising on
customer service.

In addition, we have also standardized and harmonized components across products to allow specific modular
components, such as traction machines, controllers/inverters and doors, to be used across multiple product
platforms, which we expect will result in lower costs due to the use of fewer parts, a leaner set-up, less
complexity, higher agility and easier external sourcing. These initiatives are aimed at focusing our sales teams on
value-based selling by presenting customers with a harmonized product portfolio of key high quality, high
margin products.

We plan to adapt our manufacturing to focus on products that provide our customers with one of three
customization levels for low-rise buildings (less than 45 meters), mid-rise buildings (between 45 and 100 meters)
and high-rise buildings (above 100 meters). These customization levels comprise: (i) Value for Money “100,”
which is our lower priced option with no customization; (ii) Performance “200,” which is our moderately priced
option with medium customization; and (iii) Customization “300,” which is our high priced option with full
customization. This value proposition model offers customers flexible and transparent pricing, which we expect
will make our products especially compelling to customers in high-volume and growth markets, such as large
property developers in Asia/Pacific. Our processes, in turn, will be optimized by focusing on a leaner offering
and steering our salesforces and engineers toward a focus on sales efforts based on product margin potentials and
the conversion of New Installation units into Service contracts and later into Modernization sales.

_Manufacturing Optimization_

We are engaged in an ongoing effort to optimize our manufacturing operations. These measures have included
closing and, where possible, consolidating manufacturing sites, increasing outsourcing of standardized products
and developing factories with improved technology for greater automation. For example, in Asia/Pacific, we

141


-----

have established leaner manufacturing operations, with a newly established plant in India and advances in
automation at our plants in China and South Korea. In the Americas, we have consolidated all North America
manufacturing at our Middleton facility to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. In Europe/Africa, we have
shifted our factories away from a regional focus (in which a particular factory only serves specific countries) to a
model where all factories can deliver to the entire Europe/Africa region, with each factory having a dedicated
product focus. As part of this shift, we have restructured our Móstoles plant in Spain and we are currently
restructuring our operations in Germany to reduce costs and simplify production.

In the long term, we aim to move away from a classic factory model, where the focus is on major production and shipping
of complete elevator systems and requires high personnel expenses, towards a model where we produce only key, mission
critical components and outsource commoditized parts, resulting in lower fixed costs and higher productivity.

_Service and Modernization Growth and Digitalization_

We aim to deliver service growth through leveraging our attractive business model and IoT innovation
technology.

Our business model contributes to the growth of our Service and Modernization business as, on average, 70% to
80% of New Installation contracts convert into Service contracts, and many of those Service business customers
eventually become customers of the Modernization business. We aim to grow our Service business, which is a
source of stable and recurring sales and high margins, by pursuing multiple initiatives aimed at increasing
revenues per unit while decreasing costs. In particular, we believe that our use of digital and IoT technologies,
including the recently developed MAX and VIEW systems, will enable us to improve customer satisfaction by
increasing service quality and efficiency, and thereby increase customer retention rates and decrease cancellation
rates. Particularly, in North America, our Service business growth is driven by the reduction of cancellation rates.
We have already improved our cancellation rates and we aim to reduce our cancellation rates further through
strict management focus and tools like the MAX and VIEW.

We expect the growth of our Service business will contribute to new Modernization customers as the installed
base grows and ages, generating an additional stream of stable and recurring revenues. We also believe that we
can leverage the scale and efficiency gains achieved by MAX and VIEW to reduce the costs per unit of providing
services, such as technician travel time and spare parts. In addition, we intend to increase our rate of winning
customers away from competitor service providers by enhancing the efficiency of our spare parts organization,
increasing our service training and leveraging the superior quality of our Service business and our capability to
refurbish multi-brand spare parts through our ITS unit.

_SG&A costs optimization_

We aim to reduce SG&A costs by centralizing administrative functions, adopting a range of organizational
efficiency measures and improving our IT systems. Specifically, we are engaged in an ongoing effort to combine
a wide array of administrative processes that historically have been performed locally, such as billing, payroll
and purchasing, into shared service centers. For example, in the United States, we are in the process of
consolidating these functions, previously spread over 18 locations, into one shared service center at the US
headquarters in Atlanta, and we intend to roll out a similar strategy in Europe and Asia. We are also in the
process of harmonizing our IT processes by rolling out VIEW globally, continuing to transition to cloud-based
services, adopting global templates and standards, “delayering,” or flattening, management levels to simplify our
organization and reduce overhead costs and adopting other efficiency enhancements. These measures have
resulted in more than €80 million in total cost savings over the last three financial years.

_Procurement Optimization_

Finally, throughout our Core strategy, we aim to reduce our procurement costs by optimizing our supply chains
through commercial measures, such as, for example, supplier days, clustering managed spend, and engaging in
e-auctions, continuing from measures implemented historically. For example, between the 2011/2012 Financial
Year and the 2018/2019 Financial Year, our purchasing savings increased by 300%, outpacing our procurement
spend which increased by 50%.

_Transformation Program_

Following the Acquisition, we expect to realize €240 million in potential cost savings by September 30, 2021
through the Sponsors’ Transformation Program, assuming the program will be implemented beginning on July 1,
2020 and driven by key management, including the Chief Executive Officer of the Group. The Transformation
Program focuses on cost savings opportunities related to (i) commercial operations, (ii) service operations,
(iii) procurement costs, (iv) G&A costs and (v) other operational costs. Some of these initiatives will be continued
through the efficiency measures, which we are already in the process of implementing, as described above.

-----

As part of our commercial operations initiatives under the Transformation Program, we aim to improve our
organizational efficiency by restructuring and centralizing our sales supports team, including by shifting
employees to low cost countries. In addition, we seek to increase our sales force productivity through various
measures, including improving our administrative processes and completing faster technical sales. This is
facilitated by our offering of fewer customization options resulting from the optimization of our product and
service portfolios. We also intend to increase our focus on sales efforts based on product margin potentials and
the conversion of New Installation units into Service contracts and later into Modernization sales. We expect to
realize cost savings in an aggregate amount of €7 million related to our commercial operations initiatives.

As part of our service operations initiatives under the Transformation Program, we aim to improve our
organizational efficiency by rationalizing the number of our application engineers, reducing the number of
platforms in our offering, standardizing our service offering and reducing the number of our service centers,
particularly in the U.S. We intend to implement other measures under these initiatives as well, including improving
process, technology and performance management in order to increase the productivity of our service technicians.
We expect to realize cost savings in an aggregate amount of €15 million related to our service operations initiatives.

As part of our procurement initiatives under the Transformation Program, we intend to implement multiple
measures to reduce costs relating to our procurement activities. For the 2018/2019 Financial Year, we believe
that our estimated addressable cost base for procurement activities comprised €2.1 billion of direct costs and
€0.5 billion of indirect costs. To reduce these costs, we intend to establish group-wide supply agreements with
global suppliers for key categories of direct materials, such as motors, cables and doors, including through
leveraging change-of-control provisions under our existing supplier agreements with local or regional suppliers.
We also expect to increase our focus on supplier driven innovation in connection with, among other things,
tendering processes. To pursue improvements in specification management, we seek to standardize purchases for
complex parts and establish business unit sourcing boards, which will act as advisory panels in key end markets
to promote best practices and streamline procurement processes. Furthermore, we continue to shift our
relationships with local suppliers to regional suppliers in order to both increase the number of sites served by our
suppliers and decrease the number of our total suppliers, resulting in increased efficiencies. We also continue to
streamline the amount and variety of individually supplied components in order to purchase bundles of different
products and higher volumes of specific products, resulting in improved purchasing ability. Moreover, where
appropriate, we target shifting to agreements with suppliers in low cost countries or otherwise shifting purchases
from our suppliers of local products to products sourced from low cost countries. In addition, we are working to
utilize both centralized regional lead-buyers to streamline demand-management processes and defined sourcing
hubs to allow for best value and benchmark sourcing through increased spend, price and margin transparency.
Furthermore, we expect to realize cost savings from our commercial operations initiatives that result in the
rationalization of our product offering and standardization of our SKUs. We expect to realize cost savings in an
aggregate amount of €132 million in connection with our procurement initiatives.

As part of our G&A cost savings initiatives under the Transformation Program, we aim to improve our
organizational efficiency and generate attrition savings through a leaner operating model, the shifting of
employees to low cost countries and increased automation, including within our shared service centers. We
expect to realize cost savings in an aggregate amount of €36 million related to our G&A cost savings initiatives.

As part of our other operational initiatives under the Transformation Program, we aim to reduce direct and
indirect personnel expenses and scrappage costs by decreasing the portion of poor quality production. We target
replicating the cost of poor quality levels that we have achieved at our Korean plant (where such costs are
estimated to be 0.6% of internal sales) at our other plants, particularly our Middleton plant. We also intend to
outsource parts and components and streamline production overhead and assembly processes to reduce costs. We
expect to realize cost savings in an aggregate amount of €50 million related to our other operational initiatives.

We expect to incur one-off costs amounting to between €240 and €294 million in connection with these
initiatives, mainly as a result of (i) voluntary redundancy, early retirement and other severance costs, (ii) staff
training costs, (iii) investments in IT to digitize, automate and streamline processes, (iv) investments in the
existing shared service centers in Europe, Brazil and the U.S., as well as potentially operating new, regional
centers in Eastern Europe and Asia and (v) consulting, financial and legal advisory fees in connection with
implementing these initiatives.

**_Core+ Strategy: Deliver additional value through innovation, digitalization and bolt-on acquisitions_**

Our Core+ strategy aims to deliver additional value by (i) focusing on disruptive innovation, (ii) monetizing IoT
opportunities, (iii) seeking opportunistic mergers and acquisitions and (iv) continuing the measures defined under
our Core strategy.

We have a long-standing German engineering heritage and a history of innovative digital solutions with the
potential to transform the Elevator and Escalator division. We are a leading innovator in the elevator and
escalator market and strive to address what we believe are fundamental technological challenges to better serve a
rapidly urbanizing society. For example, we estimate that up to 40% of usable space in buildings is utilized for
elevator shafts. Our TWIN elevator system combines two independent cars in one shaft in order to increase
efficiency and creates more usable area by using up to 25% less usable space than an ordinary elevator. The
TWIN elevator system’s unique value-add has made it a top choice for premier buildings around the world,
including the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, Germany, and the CMA Tower in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. We
believe that our MULTI elevator system, which is currently in the developing phase, has the potential to be even
more compelling to the market. MULTI is a rope-less elevator able to move both vertically and horizontally,
which will allow new architectural designs and unlimited building height and, we estimate, will use up to 30% to
50% less usable space than an ordinary elevator. We believe that our New Installation customers place a high
value on innovative solutions like TWIN and MULTI, which both have the potential to significantly increase the
usable area in buildings that is available for sale or rent.

We also aim to continue to monetize our IoT technologies more effectively in the future to create sustainable
business value and cash flow. By the 2021/2022 Financial Year, we aim to charge connection and monthly fees
to customers for using MAX, which already supported the servicing of over 129,000 units as of March 31, 2020.
Other innovations currently in the pipeline include our asset performance management solution as well as our
Intelligent Gate Management System, part of our Access Solutions division. We plan to follow the MAX
blueprint for these and other new products by clearly demonstrating the value of the product after launch,
bringing the technology to maturity and then developing a pricing and sales model that accurately reflects our
value to customers.

In addition, we have a track record of successful mergers and acquisitions, including most recently our
acquisitions of Nashville Machine’s elevator division and O’Keefe Elevator Company, Inc. in the 2018/2019
Financial Year. We plan to further develop our profit potential by opportunistically seeking future M&A targets,
which we believe can be value accretive to the Group.

**History**

The heritage of thyssenkrupp dates back to 1811, when Friedrich Krupp founded a cast steel factory in his
hometown of Essen, Germany, and 1871, when August Thyssen established Thyssen & Co. Both companies
separately evolved into major industrial conglomerates until they were combined into thyssenkrupp through a
merger in 1999.

While the Elevator Technology Business was historically integrated with thyssenkrupp’s operations,
thyssenkrupp began a separation process to facilitate the Acquisition in 2019. On December 31, 2019, all assets
and liabilities that form part of the Elevator Technology Business were transferred to thyssenkrupp Elevator
Holding GmbH, which was subsequently converted to an Aktiengesellschaft and renamed as thyssenkrupp
Elevator AG (the “Target”). thyssenkrupp Elevator AG is the top holding company of the Elevator Technology
Business, the sole shareholder of thyssenkrupp Elevator Innovation and thyssenkrupp Elevator Holding and a
wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of thyssenkrupp AG.

The Elevator Technology Business was incepted in the second half of the 20th century, when the industrial
conglomerate that is now thyssenkrupp acquired several elevator manufacturers in Germany and Western
Europe, including Rheinstahl AG, a specialist in the construction and installation of transportation equipment,
elevators, escalators and jet bridges. Leveraging this new industry experience and its German engineering
heritage, the Elevator Technology Business flourished and soon delivered major advances in elevator and
escalator technology. Building on its early success in Europe, thyssenkrupp continued to broaden its footprint in
the global elevator and escalator market through further acquisitions in Germany, Canada, the Netherlands and
the United States in the 1980s and 1990s, which also expanded its service scope into home solutions such as
chairlifts. Having constructed a dedicated elevator factory in Neuhausen, near Stuttgart, Germany in the 1970s,
thyssenkrupp further expanded its production capacities as the Elevator Technology Business continued to grow,
adding an escalator factory in Spain in 1991 and an elevator and escalator factory in Zhongshan, China in 1995,
which also marked the business’s entry into the Asia/Pacific region. After the turn of the century, thyssenkrupp
made targeted acquisitions to further build up its market position, primarily including the purchase of KONE

Our Access Solutions division is divided into two operational units. One operational unit offers airport access
solutions, such as passenger boarding bridges, ground support equipment, visual docking guidance systems,
ancillary equipment products and maintenance services (“Airport Solutions”). The other operational unit offers
home access solutions, such as chairlifts, platform lifts and home elevators (“Home Solutions”).

**Our Business Lines**

Our operations comprise three business lines:

- _New Installation: Our New Installation business covers the design, manufacture and installation of_
elevators, escalators and moving walks for all major markets and industries, including for both commercial
and residential projects and includes low-rise, mid-rise and high-rise solutions offered at different
customization levels. We are a global leader in the new installations and believe we are renowned for our
global reach, innovation capability (including the development of digital solutions) and ability to execute
the most advanced elevator projects, having been involved in some of the most prominent architectural
projects in recent years. Our New Installation business contributed 49%, 48% and 46% in sales in the
Financial Years 2016/2017, 2017/2018 and 2018/2019, respectively.

- _Service: Our Service business offers a broad range of maintenance services both for our own and third-party_
equipment, with a view to ensuring the continued safety, performance and efficiency of elevators,
escalators, moving walks and access solutions throughout their usable lives. Depending on the scope agreed
in our service contracts, our services range from basic oil and grease maintenance to bespoke full-service
packages that include the sale and installation of replacement parts. Our Service business had approximately
1,000 service branches servicing approximately 1.4 million units under maintenance (including 60,000 units
from the Access Solutions division) worldwide as of March 31, 2020. Since services have to be provided
regularly to keep elevators and our other solutions in operation, our Service business creates a recurring and
stable revenue stream. Our Service business contributed 41%, 42% and 42% in sales for the Financial Years
2016/2017, 2017/2018 and 2018/2019, respectively.

**Products, Services and Modernizations**

**_Products of the Elevator and Escalator division_**

_Elevator Products_

We are a leading elevator and escalator company in terms of global reach and innovation (including the
development of digital solutions) and have the ability to execute the most prestigious elevator projects in our
industry. We cover the entire design and installation of elevator systems for all major markets and industry types.
Some of our recent credentials include the Hudson Yards development and the One World Trade Center, New
York, the Beijing International Airport T3 Terminal and the Federation Tower, Russia.

We provide elevator solutions for office buildings, apartment buildings, shopping centers, hotels, hospitals, train
and metro stations, airports and other similar applications. This includes the design, manufacture and installation
of traction drive elevators (driven by electric motor and cable), with or without a machine room, and hydraulic
drive elevators (driven by hydraulic cylinder). In North America, hydraulic drive elevators are more commonly
used, compared to the rest of the world, where traction drive elevators are more common. We cover all classes
and applications, from economical residential to more demanding commercial projects. These include low-rise,
mid- rise and high-rise solutions; as well as several innovative high-end elevator technologies. Our offerings are
driven by demand in the relevant markets, as well as applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Where
possible, we strive to utilize the same components (such as doors, controllers and traction machines) across
product types and models. However, since each elevator must be tailored to the specific building and the
regulatory requirements of the jurisdiction where it is installed, there can be significant differences between
individual elevators from the same product line.

We aim to categorize our product lines into three platforms, including solutions for low-rise, mid-rise and highrise buildings. Each product platform generally offers three primary options with regards to their performance,
durability and customization level: “Value for Money” (no customization), “Performance” (medium
customization) and “Customization” (full customization).

We offer four core elevator product lines, which may be marketed under different brands in certain regions. A
product line forms the basis for each individual elevator’s design, which we develop in accordance with each
customer’s specific customization needs and the applicable local technical and regulatory requirements.
Accordingly, elevators from the same product line can have different technical specifications when installed in
different regions of the world. We also offer additional elevator products to provide greater client-driven
optionality. Our four core elevator product lines are described below:

- _evolution / meta—Our Americas and Europe/Africa segments market the evolution elevator product line in_
the Americas, Europe and Africa. Our Asia/Pacific segment offers a product that is similar to the
“evolution” elevator product line under the meta brand.

- _momentum / zeta—Our Americas and Europe/Africa segments also offer the momentum elevator product_
line across the Americas, Europe and Africa. Our Asia/Pacific segment offers a similar product under the
_zeta brand._

- _synergy / enta—The Europe/Africa segment offers the synergy product line, which is primarily meant for_
low-rise constructions. Our Asia/Pacific segment offers a similar product under the enta brand.

- _endura—The Americas segment also sells the endura product line, which is a hydraulic model in_
accordance with the technological preference in North America.

(1) Local hydraulic product for the U.S. market. Maximum travel height of 18 meters.

In addition to our core product lines described above, we also sell freight elevators and other specialized
elevators tailored to serve specific transportation purposes, as well as our innovative products and solutions.
These include the following:

- _TWIN—The TWIN elevator system has two separate cars which are arranged on top of one another within_
the same single elevator shaft and operate independently of one another. The TWIN allows one elevator
shaft to handle up to 40% more passengers and to save labor and material expenses since only one elevator
shaft is needed for two cars. This increases leasable and otherwise usable space in buildings by up to 25%.
The TWIN has made it a top choice for premier buildings throughout the world, including the European
Central Bank in Frankfurt, Germany and the CMA Tower in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

- _MULTI—The MULTI elevator system is expected to be the world’s first rope-less, linear motor driven_
elevator system. It is designed to operate with multiple cars existing within one shaft, and also to move
seamlessly between horizontal and vertical shafts within a building. In a practical sense, this reduces
passenger wait times, significantly increases potential passenger capacity and reduces elevator weight and
mass for energy reduction and increased usable space in building design. While TWIN saves up to 25% of
usable space in buildings, the MULTI increases those savings up to approximately 30-50% in high-rise
buildings. Beyond these practical benefits, the MULTI’s unique design also opens up a significant range of
new possibilities for architects in the design of modern buildings by removing the building height and
breadth restrictions presented by traditional elevator systems. The MULTI system is currently in prototype
design stage with a test version running in our test tower in Rottweil, Germany.

In addition, we also manufacture solutions to enhance the efficiency of existing elevator systems. For instance,
our AGILE solution, which is a digital user interface and building management system, based on the IoT
technology, allows building managers to intelligently group and assign passengers to elevators and facilitate
rapid movement of people to their destination. AGILE comes with four core elements, which revolve around
destination control, enhanced security, a design center featuring a touch screen interface and an elevator
management center.


_Escalator and Moving Walk Products_

Our escalators and moving walk product lines provide state-of-the-art technology and have the ability to handle
heavy traffic and frequent use. Similar to our capabilities in the elevator market, we are able to develop,


148


-----

manufacture and install top-quality escalators and moving walks for the most demanding projects. Our escalator
and moving walk offerings include products for all applications, including train stations, airports and office
buildings, and are designed to meet the highest operational and safety standards.

Escalators and moving walks traditionally consist of a robust drive unit/electric motor, steps, handrail/balustrade,
step chain, truss, coverings of various materials and a central control unit. We customize these elements in close
cooperation with each particular customer for any of our product lines. Many of the world’s largest recent
infrastructure and commercial building projects have featured our escalators, including the Lester B. Pearson
International Airport, Toronto, the Indira Gandhi International Airport, New Delhi, the One World Trade Center,
New York, as well as the Amsterdam and Shenzhen metro networks.

We offer three types of escalators, with minor regional variations, each helping to move passengers safely,
efficiently and comfortably:

- _velino: the velino commercial-duty escalator is designed to preserve the architectural integrity of buildings,_
and, with our compact dimensions, is ideal for shopping malls. The dual CPU controllers and the optional
variable voltage variable frequency (“VVVF”) drive technology, save energy and help keep operating costs
low.

- _tugela: the tugela heavy-duty escalator is designed for high-rise applications and locations with heavy_
traffic. Featuring larger motors and chains than the velino, combined with reinforced handrail drives, it is
well-suited for convention centers, stadiums, smaller airports or other places where large numbers of people
need to be transported.

- _victoria: the victoria transit-duty escalator represents our most rugged escalator, ideal for non-stop_
applications for transport hubs, such as the busiest and most technically challenging metro and train stations,
as well as larger airports. It is our most powerful escalator, featuring a specially reinforced drive system
capable of delivering nonstop maximum performance throughout the day even when operating at full load
capacity.

We manufacture three core types of moving walks, which transport passengers safely and quickly to their
destination in metro and train stations, airports or other buildings:

- _orinoco: the orinoco moving walks offer indoor and outdoor transportation solutions, allowing the_
transportation of large volumes of passengers carrying luggage and allowing sufficient space to pass
standing passengers safely.

- _iwalk: the iwalk moving walks offer indoor and outdoor transportation solutions, allowing pit or pit-less_
installation. To address building settings that offer minimal or no clearance for drive mechanisms directly
underneath the moving walk, our iwalk is a modular solution that opens up opportunities for architects and
developers. The modular nature of the product means that it can be easily customized, and pieces can be
removed for repair or replacement with simply a forklift, requiring minimal or no modification work to the
existing structure.

- _ACCEL: the ACCEL is our innovative, high-speed moving walk product, which is currently being_
introduced to the market. Building on linear motor technology that thyssenkrupp first developed for its work
on the Transrapid magnetic train project, the new ACCEL moving walk provides an initial speed of 0.65 m/s
and then accelerates to 2.0 m/s using a cutting-edge overlapping pallet system and synchronized handrail
system. ACCEL is able to transport passengers up to three times faster than a conventional moving walk. In
airport terminals, this can reduce connection times between gates by up to 70%, as shown by operations at
the Toronto Pearson Airport.

_New Installations of Elevators, Escalators and Moving Walks_

New Installations of elevators, escalators and moving walks refer to installations of these products in a new site.
Elevators are typically shipped as components and are assembled on site, whereas escalators are assembled in the
factory and subsequently shipped as a complete product. The installation work is either carried out by us directly
or outsourced to sub-contractors.

**_Products of the Access Solutions division_**

_Airport Solutions_

An airport is often a traveler’s first and last impression of a city or country. Passenger numbers at airports are
expected to double until 2037 (Source: The International Air Transport Association, market size (OI) based on

149


-----

_the Target’s internal estimations, public domain data and statistical calculations). We are focused on improving_
a traveler’s critical impressions while also providing intelligent solutions that elevate airport performance and
drive industry innovation. Our Airport Solutions, consisting of passenger boarding bridges, related ground
support equipment, visual docking guiding systems (VDGS) and intelligent gate management systems (IGMS),
serve airports across the world. We are a global player, outfitting some of the largest airport projects. We offer
comprehensive and flexible passenger boarding bridge options, which consider customers’ requirements and
allow them to select optimal configurations to suit their specific needs.

_Passenger boarding bridges_

Noseloader bridges are specifically designed to enable precise docking in areas with restricted aircraft size and/or
parking constraints, since they use a telescopic tunnel which extends from the terminal to connect with the
aircraft. A hydraulic elevation system ensures smooth operation while automated systems, such as
pre-positioning, reduce human error.

An apron drive bridge has more free movement by using telescopic, elevation and rotation axes to deliver
maximum docking flexibility while taking up minimal space. Our two and three-tunnel models feature
customizable steel, glazed glass or steel-and-glass walls.

For those terminals that do not provide a direct boarding bridge connection or that present design challenges such
as steep inclines, our Bridge Link (the “Bridge Link”) solution provides easy connectivity. These adaptable
“fixed tunnels” link the boarding bridge to the building. They are also customized to match the boarding bridge’s
look, feel and dimensions for a seamless passenger arrival and departure experience.

Our passenger boarding bridges can serve all commercial passenger aircraft, up to the largest in operation, the
Airbus A380, and our global footprint allows it to fulfill some of the world’s largest customer orders. Istanbul’s
new airport (IST), which opened in April 2019, is outfitted with 143 passenger boarding bridges, all provided by
us—our largest single passenger boarding bridge contract to date. We have the most comprehensive passenger
boarding bridges in the industry and are able to service our customers along the entire value chain, from New
Installations to Services and Modernizations. We have the largest global installation base of passenger boarding
bridges, with a market share of approximately 33%.

_Ground support equipment_

To support airports in their need to respond to growing air traffic worldwide, we provide ground support
equipment such as preconditioned airflow system (PCA) or ground power (400Hz) and potable water units,
which are essential to improve aircraft service operations and to avoid tarmac delays. We typically sub-contract
this equipment for manufacturing and offer these along with our passenger boarding bridges.

_Intelligent gate systems_

Our intelligent gate systems are innovative solutions that help major airports around the world avoid costly
ground operation incidents by increasing their gates’ efficiency. Solutions like our integrated management airport
system (IMAS) and atlantis (formerly FMT Atlantis) enable monitoring of integrated equipment at the gate,
including ground power units (400Hz), visual docking guidance systems, preconditioned air, surveillance
cameras and automatic doors. We have a comprehensive offering of digital solutions, which enable real time
monitoring of asset operations, automate operations and enable efficient maintenance. We believe that our APIS
(formerly FMT APIS) system is the only visual docking guidance systems that delivers 100% accurate aircraft
identification, resulting in increased gate safety, decreased turnaround times and reduced environmental impact.
We believe that these intelligent solutions simplify formerly time and labor-consuming tasks, reduce human error
and deliver a smoother passenger experience, in addition to improving aircraft turnaround times at the gate. Our
key strength is to provide the right software for the hardware, which enables a one-stop solution for ensuring that
all components work together and ensures safety, reliability and overall quality of our products and services.

_Home Solutions_

Our Home Solutions address mobility issues for aging segments of the world’s population as well as those with
disabilities by offering products that are robust and reliable. From chairlifts and platform lifts to home elevators,
we enable people to move independently and comfortably in their homes and other buildings.

_Chairlifts_

Chairlifts eliminate the barrier posed by stairs by providing a seat attached to a track which runs along the
staircase. In many cases, chairlifts are retrofitted onto an existing structure, which can make each installation

150


-----

complex and unique. Our chairlifts strive to balance design and functionality, offering optimal accessibility,
while meeting ergonomic requirements. We believe that our patented advanced swiveling and leveling (ASL)
technologies make our chairlifts among the industry’s best. Both elderly customers and government institutions
use our chairlift solutions.

We believe we are a technology leader for chairlifts. Our HoloLinc[®] application, of which more than 100 units
are already being used in the field, is the world’s first mixed reality chairlift solution, which employs a new headmounted, mixed-reality HoloLinc device from Microsoft to allows our customers and employees to more quickly
and accurately measure the space in which a chairlift is to be installed, which we believe reduces overall lead
time, helping to reduce customer stress and to lower costs.

_Platform lifts_

Our platform lifts provide people in wheelchairs with independent access to areas with inclines or vertical rises,
improving access to indoor and outdoor public spaces, such as government buildings, tourist sites and public
transportation systems, as well as to private areas. The platform lifts come equipped with ergonomic design
elements, including joystick control and safety features.

_Home elevators_

Drawing on our decades of experience in commercial elevators, we have developed a line of customized lifts for
private homes or standardized lifts for housing construction projects. They can be designed with or without a
shaft and can be integrated easily into existing or new homes.

**_Service Offering of the Service Business_**

We consider the Service business, a source of stable, recurring sales and high margins for us, as our most
important product and the heart of our business model. We service approximately 1.4 million units under
maintenance as of March 31, 2020. We offer a broad range of Services, from basic oil and grease maintenance to
bespoke full-service packages, to ensure highest safety, performance and efficiency of elevators, escalators and
moving walks. We also have an ITS Unit, a part of our Elevators and Escalators division, which reverse
engineers elevator and escalator products manufactured by third parties to develop capability of providing
services for such equipment. Since our products have to be serviced regularly throughout their entire life span,
the Service business typically creates a recurring and stable revenue stream for us.

Our net sales in the Service business are driven by the conversion of New Installations units into service
contracts. This is evidenced by our average conversion rate of approximately 70% to 80% globally (the
conversion rate being calculated as the percentage of New Installations units (excluding distributor sales, which
do not directly result in access to servicing the relevant units) that have been converted into Service contracts).
We also have an average retention rate globally of above 90% for our Service customers (calculated as units
under maintenance at the end of the year divided by units under maintenance at the beginning of the year,
adjusted for new units under maintenance at the end of that financial year). As of September 30, 2019, our units
under maintenance were served by approximately 1,000 branches, of which 300 branches were in the Americas
segment, 300 branches in the Europe/Africa segment and 400 branches were in the Asia/Pacific segment. We
have also recently begun implementing shared service centers, designed to enhance efficiency by centralizing a
number of administrative processes across regions.

Our Services are provided based on service contracts with the customers. The service contracts set out the scope
of the service package for the customers and range from basic packages, including inspection and testing, to full
maintenance packages which may include services such as preventative maintenance, repair, parts repair and
replacement, quality assurance, annual safety testing, after hours emergency service, quality assurance or release
of passengers trapped in cabins. Pricing for our Services depends upon the type of contract. In a full service
contract, the main costs are those of labor and components. In an oil & grease service contract, the main cost is
labor. The majority of our service contracts have a term of one to five years but may also go up to ten years in
some regions. Typically, we include the first one or two years of maintenance for a newly installed elevator or
escalator in the New Installations price, depending on the region.

MAX, our cloud-based digitally enhanced maintenance solution, is designed to increase service quality by
reducing downtime by up to 50% through creating information transparency for the customer. As of March 31,
2020, more than 129,000 MAX units had been installed globally. We collaborated with Microsoft on MAX to
develop an IoT based end-to-end solution to digitally transform service operations and create new customer
solutions. MAX is supported by VIEW, our operational business steering tool which automatically dispatches
qualified technicians to resolve the problems identified by MAX.

151


-----

MAX enables machine data from elevators and escalators to be collected globally in real-time using a proprietary
IoT device. This and additional internal data is then transmitted to the cloud through highly secure channels and
analyzed using VIEW to generate actionable insights for our technicians, improve reliability and availability of
the elevator or escalator units and create transparency for our customers. This real-time diagnosis draws the
technician’s attention to necessary action not only when shutdowns happen but even before the defect occurs.
The cloud-based modular and extendable nature of the MAX platform sets us apart from our competitors’
offerings, which are extensions of traditional systems.

We also use real-time troubleshooting with online diagnostic and customer service tools, as well as remote
monitoring to service our approximately 1.4 million units under maintenance as of March 31, 2020.

Changes in the legal and regulatory environment applicable to the products are a key factor that influences the
services provided by our Service business. The different legal and regulatory regimes also determine the scope of
service provided by us within the Operating Segments.

**_Services of the Modernization Business_**

With the average age of buildings steadily growing in many countries, property owners increasingly need to
invest in modernizing their people transportation systems. We therefore offer comprehensive elevator and
escalator modernization to enable our customers to comply with applicable legal requirements and to prolong
their elevator and escalator system’s lifespan safely and cost efficiently. Our Modernization business addresses
challenges relating to the customers’ need to comply with constantly evolving standards and regulations,
age-related wear and tear, efficiency and capacity optimization. Modernization benefits may include lower
operating costs, greater energy efficiency and increased tenant satisfaction, as well as an increase in the
building’s value.

Our partial Modernization solutions for elevators include safety and regulatory retrofits (e.g. fire control
systems), the replacement of individual components to match existing ones (e.g., door drives and operating
panels), a new look for the cabin and entrance, retrofits for increased comfort (e.g., door zone monitoring
systems), more functionality (e.g. access control) and optimizing energy consumption (e.g., LED lighting that
switches off when the cabin is standing still). We offer modernization solutions not only for elevator systems
which we have manufactured and installed, but also for elevators manufactured and installed by third-party
companies. Our solutions can be adapted to all existing installations, regardless of the component type and its
manufacturer. We utilize widely used and tested technologies, plus flexibility in parts supplied for such
modernization projects.

We also offer a wide range of tailored replacement solutions for existing elevator systems (with or without a
machine room). These solutions go beyond simple modernization upgrades to encompass the complete
replacement of an existing elevator system. Our replacement solutions seek to make use of the existing shaft and
avoid additional masonry, structural modification and painting. This not only limits costs, but also reduces the
amount of dust and noise produced by the modernization process. Our replacement solutions range from very
small lift systems to our high-end TWIN system, depending on the particular customer’s needs and the available
infrastructure, which offers the potential to expand transport capacity within the same shaft footprint.

In addition, we offer modernization solutions not only for elevators, but also for escalators, moving walks and
airport solution systems. For escalators and moving walks, the modernization solutions include the replacement
of individual components such as steps and handrails or, if necessary, the entire system. We offer retrofitting
measures to increase the system’s energy efficiency, such as energy efficiency controller (EEC), LED lighting or
skirt brushes.

**Manufacturing**

**_Manufacturing process_**

Our manufacturing processes begin with the order intake for a new elevator, escalator or our other products and
culminate with installing and assembling the system at our customer’s site. The manufacturing process is not
only a key element for the New Installation business, but also for the Modernization business, if significant
system upgrades are required. The main steps of the manufacturing process include the configuration of the
system, as well as the production of components by us or the procurement of components from third-party
suppliers. Whether a segment purchases components for its products from third-party suppliers in accordance
with our procurement strategy (for more details on our procurement process, see “Procurement and Supply
_Management”) or whether it produces them itself depends on a variety of factors. Standardized and commodity_
components are often sourced from third parties whereas technically complex and bespoke components are

152


-----

typically produced by us. Our manufacturing operations are steered centrally from our headquarters, but have
their organizational structures within each Operating Segment to accommodate the particularities of the markets
in which such segment operates.

**_Manufacturing facilities_**

In Europe, the main manufacturing facilities for the Elevator and Escalator divisions are located in Neuhausen
and Hamburg in Germany and Móstoles (Madrid), Andoain and Norte (Mieres) in Spain. The facilities in
Hamburg and Mieres are focused on escalators and moving walks, manufacturing high-end products for high-end
markets, including escalators for metro and train stations. The elevator factory in Neuhausen serves the high-rise
business, but also the mid-rise business, including the evolution line, for the European market, but also for export
of components such as traction drives to other regions. The factory in Móstoles (Madrid) manufactures the
synergy line, mainly for the European markets, and, to a lesser extent, for export to other regions. It is supported
by Andoain, which is mainly assembling electrical controllers. The facility in Mieres, Spain is focused on
escalators for the European and Latin American markets.

In North America, the factory is located in Middleton, Tennessee, United States, and the order management
organization is located in Germantown, Tennessee, United States, one hour away from the factory, serving not
only the manufacturing process of the New Installation business, but also providing the configuration services
and components for the Modernization business in the United States. The factory in Guaiba, Porto Alegre, Brazil,
manufactures elevators for the Latin American market, including Mexico.

In the Asia/Pacific region, the main manufacturing facilities for the Elevator and Escalator divisions are located
in: Songjiang, China; Shanghai, China; Zhongshan, China; Cheonan City, South Korea; and Pune, India.
Songjiang is the headquarter for Asia manufacturing and includes a production facility for traction machines,
doors and controllers. Shanghai serves the value for money market in China and is a manufacturing facility only,
as all production processes are outsourced, and components are bought in the market. Zhongshan comprises two
separate manufacturing facilities for high-rise elevators, including a test tower, and escalators. Cheonan in South
Korea is one of the manufacturing facilities with the best operational KPIs within the Group (such as sales per
employee) and is strategically important to serve the South Korean market. The facility in Pune is our newest and
was built to serve the Indian market, which is otherwise difficult to access due to high import taxes, specific code
requirements and a heavily localized supply chain.

The main manufacturing facilities for the Access Solutions division are located in: Fort Worth (Texas), United
States; Krimpen aan den Ijssel, the Netherlands; Pisa, Italy; Mieres, Spain; and Shanghai, China. Our Access
Solutions division’s key manufacturing facilities are strategically located in close proximity to our end-markets
and customers. The division has five manufacturing facilities: three with respect to Home Solutions (located in
the Netherlands, Italy and China), and two with respect to Airport Solutions (located in the United States and
Spain). Our Access Solutions division operates 14 service stations focused on Airport Solutions and ten field
locations focused on Home Solutions. The unit is headquartered in Essen, Germany.

**Procurement and Supply Management**

In order to install, manufacture and service our products, we rely on sourcing a wide range of components,
technical goods and raw materials, as well as services, such as elevator installation services, IT services and
marketing.

**_Organizational structure_**

We manage our global purchasing activities through a group-wide procurement organization, in order to leverage
the demand and benefit from economies of scale in our procurement of doors, controllers, traction machines,
guiderails and transmission means. Our material field strategies are based on an extensive knowledge of
customer needs and business requirements, global supply markets, and supplier capabilities. Under the material
field strategies, spending is actively steered towards selected suppliers. However, due to diverging regional
regulatory requirements and customer demands, procurement decisions are still made at the local level, subject to
compliance with the global procurement framework. In particular, differences exist between demands driven by
code requirements for North America and other markets where we operate. Therefore, a major portion of our
procurement staff works at the operational level.

**_Procurement strategy_**

We aim to generate the highest possible added value and sustainable reduction of material costs while ensuring
high levels of material availability and quality, and evaluate whether components should be sourced from supply

153


-----

markets or manufactured in-house. This decision is mainly driven by the competitiveness of the supply chains for
specific components. Specialized components on the other hand are usually manufactured in-house in order to
safeguard the technological features of such components.

In order to avoid dependencies on individual suppliers, we aim to have at least two suppliers for each of its
components in different geographic regions, and, ideally, five or six, to be able to auction our demands and
award the contract to the most competitive offer. Typically, supply contracts include no volume commitments,
ensuring high flexibility for us.

**Real Property**

We operate numerous manufacturing facilities worldwide and use land with office buildings, warehouses,
research and development facilities, and other facilities in a large number of countries as either owner or lessee.
Our lease contracts are currently centrally managed by thyssenkrupp Real Estate GmbH and are in the process of
being transferred to thyssenkrupp Elevator on a decentralized approach, to take effect from the Acquisition
Closing Date. We lease some of our premises, including our current headquarters in Essen, from thyssenkrupp
AG. We are currently proposing to move our headquarters to a standalone location in 2021, but are likely to
continue leasing several other premises from thyssenkrupp AG, after the Acquisition Closing Date.

Lease payments and service fees payable under the relevant lease agreement are on an arm’s length basis.
Operational expenditure and external costs incurred by thyssenkrupp group-companies in connection with a
specific lease agreement are either included in the monthly lease payable under the lease agreement, or passedthrough to the relevant user of the space according to a pre-determined contractual distribution key or according
to the space occupied by a relevant user on a pro rata basis.

**Customers**

We have different types of customers from both the public and the private sector. In the New Installation and
Modernization businesses, we typically enter into contracts with construction companies, developers or directly
with the owners of a building. In some cases, contracts are entered into with dealers or resellers who then sell our
products to the end-customers. Home Solutions is our only business where we sell to consumers directly as well
as through our dealer network.

In the Service business, our contracting partner is typically the owner of the building where maintenance work is
carried out. In some regions, the services are contracted by a property or facility manager.

Since the New Installation business is project-driven, the customer base is very fragmented. The Service business
on the other hand is shaped by long-term customer relationships, but equally has a highly diversified customer
base. Our Services contracts have tenors of varying periods. Full service contracts could go up to five years,
whereas oil & grease service contracts generally have a one-year tenor, often with an automatic renewal clause.

Generally, our top 10 customers change every year and typically account for less than 3% of revenues in a given
financial year, leading to a highly diversified customer base.

We aim to build long lasting customer relationships where the New Installation business leads to Service
business and ultimately to Modernization business. For competitors to maintain our service equipment installed
by us would require investment into the diagnostic, tooling, training, operational systems and inventories that we
continually develop. We believe that our customers generally rationalize the value of our support structure and
our consistent service delivery, even if it comes at a slight premium. Our retention rate has been more than 90%
for each of the 2016/2017, 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 Financial Years and the six months ended March 31, 2020.
Ideally, customers become long-term customers of all three businesses.

**Sales Network and Marketing**

We have an extensive sales and services network around the globe covering the majority of the world’s countries.
As of March 31, 2020, more than 60 countries are covered by our own field operations, whereas approximately
40 countries are being served via distributors. Distributors are our strategic partners that sell our products and
services either exclusively or non-exclusively. In the 2018/2019 Financial Year, approximately 17% of our sales
were generated through third party intermediaries, such as our distributors. Our sales intermediaries’ landscape is
highly fragmented and we are not materially dependent on any specific intermediary to conduct our business. The
sales network follows our sales process named “EAGLE”. EAGLE sets out guidelines to provide a harmonized
sales process throughout the Operating Segments, to increase efficiency and transparency and to focus on
customer interaction by implementing a common sales vision that aims to ensure that the same customer

154


-----

approach is followed across our branches. It is supported by three bespoke training modules that the respective
sales representatives, sales managers and branch managers, as well as sales support personnel, call center
personnel and technicians have to undergo to ensure that the objectives set by EAGLE are adequately fulfilled.
The sales process is tracked through clearly defined performance indicators throughout the Group. We endeavor
to base business relationships on our own terms and conditions to the extent possible and have a process of
internal review in case a customer proposes different terms. The EAGLE methodology does not apply to our
third party distributors, but our distributors’ performance control is generally oriented towards this methodology
to ensure comparability our direct and indirect sales channels.

**Research and Development**

We believe we are recognized as a technology leader in our industry due to our continuous investment in our research
and development (“R&D”) capabilities. We have 16 research and development centers spread across countries in the
Americas, Europe/Africa and Asia/Pacific. We are the only supplier in the industry to have an offering similar to our
TWIN elevator system, which combines two independent cars in one shaft. We are also currently in the process of
developing the MULTI system, which would be the world’s first rope-free elevator. Our R&D work is focused on what
we consider to be the fundamental technological challenges to better serve a growing, aging and rapidly urbanizing
society. Central among these are the digital transformation of industry, climate change and energy transition. At the
same time, customer demand for high quality applications, increased functionality, design flexibility and lower cost
manufacturing processes are also driving our research and development efforts. We believe that taking a leading
position in the development of sustainable products manufactured in a sustainable way will ultimately strengthen our
position and help to distinguish us from our competitors. Throughout our research and development process, the core
principle guiding innovation is product safety.

To execute these plans, we manage the entire life cycle of our products beginning with the development of an
idea and ending with the decision on whether to launch a product.

Our research and development costs and capitalized development costs related to internally developed
innovations amounted to €106 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. We employed approximately 800 fulltime employees in research and development- related activities as of March 31, 2020.

**_Research and development strategy_**

Strategically, our focus is to perpetuate the innovation for which we and our brand are known. On the product
side, the emphasis is on steadily improving the existing products and trying to design products that will meet
customers’ design expectations while satisfying their practical needs. These include features such as ‘INSIGHT’,
which can monitor, control and schedule elevators and escalators and air-purification and anti-bacterial
ultraviolet light and face & voice recognition features, which help improve safety of elevators during the
COVID-19 crisis. With regards to the Services and Modernization, the goal is to continuously use state-of-the-art
digitalization and technology in conjunction with big data to progress the market further into the digital age,
enhancing efficiency, safety, and effectiveness, leading to greater customer satisfaction and providing
recognizable daily improvements. We are constantly on the hunt for the next new, industry-disruptive
technology, starting from incremental improvements of our existing products to entirely new product categories
and functionalities.

While we are always aiming at improving product efficiency, our research and development focus depends on
customers’ needs and interests within a particular geographic region (e.g. cost is a key driver within the Asia/
Pacific region, whereas value-add is generally more important in Europe and North America). Through research
and development, we aim to consistently provide new value-add to our customers across new and existing
products and services offered, decrease customer costs and increase product efficiency.

We believe that certain market trends and challenges will determine the main areas of our research and
development efforts in the near future. These factors include urbanization, as well as the emphasis on the safe
and efficient flow of people within cities. We also believe that opportunities exist in certain areas which
complement our broader strategy of growing our business. We will continue to deploy research and development
resources to capitalize on these perceived selective opportunities.

**_Organizational structure_**

Group-wide research and development work is driven by the Corporate Functions “Product Life Cycle
Management” (“PLM”) and R&D. These functions are established in the Operating Segments and regions where
we are active. PLM and R&D formulate and coordinate joint procedures for research and development and
secure patent and trademark protection for our innovations. Whereas PLM monitors market demands and defines
what R&D should achieve, R&D executes the research and development work to meet the goals that PLM sets.

155


-----

_PLM_

PLM has product managers for the different product segments. Product managers analyze trends, customer needs,
market potentials, competitive technologies and products under technical and commercial aspects; and translate
these trends into future products.

Pre-product development, PLM defines the product requirements, develops the business case and indicates
differentiation aspects and unique selling points. PLM aligns the product development with the segment strategy
and plans the market introduction, following which it tracks and prioritizes the product development pipeline.

Subsequently, we work to ensure the seamless integration and real-time availability of all information generated
over the lifetime of a product. The product manager defines and evaluates KPIs to measure product market
performance. The PLM process includes not only innovation and portfolio management, but also our engineering
and manufacturing through to the end of the product life cycle when we take a product off the market.

We require PLM for all our products, ensuring a process which enables us to harmonize and manage all stages of
a product life cycle, while also giving our individual segments the ability to tailor the requirements to their
specific markets. We are therefore able to provide customers with products customized exactly to their
requirements.

_Core research and development_

After PLM has set out the requirements for our products, R&D is in charge of finding solutions which satisfy the
market needs reflected in PLM’s product roadmap. The pillars of our R&D structure are the “Research and
Innovation” and “Product Design”, as well as “Test and Qualification”.

Research and Innovation is responsible for technology discovery and scouting, overseeing feasibility studies, the
coordination and initiation of research networks and the setup and management of research cooperation with
universities and industry associations.

Product Design designs all standardized products which are introduced to the markets. They are responsible for
ensuring that the designs meet the applicable standards and specifications and they define the product concept
and the details of the design.

Test and Qualification processes ensure that designs comply with regional national (safety) codes, standards and
product specifications via verification and validation procedures. Tests are planned and conceptualized for
normal and severe operations under specific lifetime and maintenance perspectives at in-house Test and
Qualification centers and our test towers. All Test and Qualification processes are documented in a standardized
way.

Our research and development approach combines a pragmatic mix of globalized and regional goals and
management, with regional teams across our Operating Segments who are positioned close to the local markets
and products. Over recent years, we have worked to further globalize what has historically been regionally
segmented teams across different Operating Segments. Through the introduction of global platforms, teams
across the Operating Segments employ common tools, work on common products and utilize shared resources to
affect our research and development shared goals. Simultaneously, these teams across the Operating Segment
maintain a distinct advantage of specialized knowledge due to their proximity to the specific local products and
market mechanics. This dual track approach allows globalized management to follow product footprints, yet
localized autonomy to leverage regional know-how.

**_Cooperation with third parties_**

We collaborate with external scientific and academic institutions. These collaborations are mainly based in the
United States and Europe. Majority of our research projects are often pursued in cooperation with globally
recognized universities or research institutes, such as Georgia Tech University, Universidad de Oviedo, the
University of Stuttgart and the University of Northampton. These critical partnerships accomplish two goals:
firstly, they assist us in accomplishing our specific research and development projects, and secondly, they
provide access to a pool of top talent from which we may hire new team members. We also participate in
industry associations and other organizations such as the European Lift Association (ELA) and the LEED
(Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification program of the US Green Building Council
(USGBC). Our innovation capability is supported by collaborations with customers or other industry sectors,
typically regarding the implementation of specific technologies in an effort to realize a specific product.

**Employees**

**_Employee statistics_**

As of March 31, 2020, we employed 52,567 employees (52,417 full-time equivalent). The following table sets
forth the number of our employees by region as at the dates indicated (not included: externals, corporate and
employees on parental leave).

**_Trade Unions and Collective Bargaining_**

Many companies in our Group are members of local employers’ associations (Arbeitgeberverbände) of the
elevator and escalator industry and/or the metal and electronics industry. Since these industries tend to be highly
unionized, many of our employees are organized in country-specific union organizations. In Germany, as an
example, many of the employees are organized in the German Industrial Union of Metalworkers (IG Metall).
Several German companies of the Group are subject to various relevant industry-wide collective bargaining
agreements (Flächentarifverträge) for the metal and electronics industry and/or apply collective bargaining
agreements which have been concluded specifically for one or several Group companies. For example, in March
2020, thyssenkrupp Elevator concluded a collective bargaining agreement “Future Elevator” with German IG
Metall in connection with the Acquisition. The “Future Elevator” collective bargaining agreement excludes
forced redundancies (“Ausschluss betriebsbedingter Beendigungskündigungen”) and provides for site guarantees
(“Standortsicherungszusagen”) for the German production and essential service sites and is valid until March 31,
2027. In many other countries in which we operate, we are bound by collective bargaining agreements with trade
unions in France, Spain, the United States, Canada and Brazil as amended from time to time.

In several countries including Germany, France, Spain, Belgium and Italy, employee representative bodies have
been established. These employee representative bodies enjoy numerous information and consultation rights
relating to personnel, social and economic matters, especially with regard to dismissals, compensation and
benefits and in case of restructurings or redundancies.

Collective agreements which are in place in various countries provide for additional protection and benefits (e.g.
severance entitlements) of employees, as well as enhanced information and consultation rights of employee
representatives in connection with lay-offs, restructurings, reorganizations and other corporate actions. In some
countries, collective agreements have been entered into with local employee representative bodies covering a
broad range of topics, in particular remuneration and working time.

A minority of our employees enjoy some form of special protection against dismissal, not only due to explicit
commitments in collective agreements, but also for other reasons, in particular statutory or contractual provisions
regarding, among other things, maternity and sick leave or works council and/or union membership.

Since 2016, we have from time to time experienced strikes at sites in France and Spain, though these have not
caused material disruptions. Good relationships with our employees are especially important to us, and we
believe that we generally have good and constructive relationships with our employees, their trade unions and
representative bodies.

**_Pension plans and retirement_**

Depending on the situation in the specific countries, we grant current and former employees and their dependents
pension and (early) retirement benefits. The pension benefits are based on various pension plans in the form of
defined benefit or defined contribution pension plans in various countries. Our obligations under these plans
vary, depending on legal, tax and economic circumstances in the various countries in which we operate, and, in
most of the countries, they generally depend on the length of service and remuneration of the employee
concerned.

157


-----

**Intellectual Property**

Our global intellectual property (“IP”) strategy aims to protect and enhance our competitive position in the
various geographic regions in which we operate. This is achieved by effective management of our IP rights,
including patents, designs and trademarks. The Group gives high priority to protecting our innovations and the
actual and future business value that we can derive therefrom. IP rights are currently centrally managed and
coordinated by thyssenkrupp Intellectual Property Services GmbH based in Essen, Germany, which provides this
service to us, with support and assistance from in-house IP professionals in key countries such as the United
States and China. After the Acquisition Closing Date, we will be managing our intellectual property with our
own in-house IP professionals and external counsel.

As of March 31, 2020, we owned approximately 900 granted patents, 570 patent families, 550 registered
trademarks and 160 trademark families and had applied for approximately 800 patents and 90 trademarks. We
also owned approximately 117 designs and applied for registration of approximately 26 designs, as of March 31,
2020.

While IP is an essential part of our business and IP assets are, in the aggregate, of material importance to our
business, we believe that no single IP asset is material to our business as a whole. On September 25, 2019,
thyssenkrupp Elevator Innovation entered into a licensing agreement with thyssenkrupp AG (the “Licensing
Agreement”), allowing us to indefinitely use certain trademarks, including the trademark “thyssenkrupp” in
carrying out the business of the Group against payment of a one- time fee. Under the terms of the Share Purchase
Agreement, the Licensing Agreement will be terminated prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, with effect as on a
date falling 18 months after the Acquisition Closing Date. We are required to use our commercially reasonable
best efforts to introduce a new brand for our business within a period of six months from the Acquisition Closing
Date.

As part of the thyssenkrupp-wide IP policy, approximately 20 of our companies have concluded IP trust
agreements with thyssenkrupp AG in 2013 pursuant to which certain IP assets are co-owned by (i) the respective
company of the Group and (ii) thyssenkrupp AG as trustee for the respective company of the Group. The IP trust
agreements cover patents, trademarks and design rights, in each case as registered or acquired after the date of
the IP trust agreements. All IP trust agreements have been terminated. The process of de-registering
thyssenkrupp AG as co-owner from the IP registers will continue until all IP assets previously covered by the IP
trust agreements are registered in the sole name of the relevant entity of the Group. This applies to approximately
800 IP rights that the Group created or acquired during the relevant period.

**Legal Proceedings**

From time to time, in the ordinary course of business, the Elevator Technology Business is subject to litigation.
Except as set forth in this offering memorandum, there were no governmental, regulatory, administrative, civil,
labor or other proceedings ongoing, pending or to our knowledge, threatened, that would have a material adverse
impact on the Elevator Technology Business as a whole.

**_Antitrust proceedings and private follow-on litigation_**

Starting in January 2004, the European Commission conducted raids on elevator and escalator manufacturers in
Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Following these inspections, the European Commission
opened an investigation into Otis, KONE, Schindler and the thyssenkrupp Group. According to the European
Commission, between 1995 and 2004, cartel members rigged bids for procurement contracts, fixed prices and
allocated projects to each other, shared markets and exchanged competitively sensitive information. The
thyssenkrupp Group was fined a total of €479.7 million in February 2007 for its involvement in this cartel. The
thyssenkrupp Group appealed the decision which resulted in a reduced fine of €319.8 million. This decision has
become final and binding and the fine has been paid. Similar proceedings, including several raids on elevator and
escalator manufacturers, were launched by the Austrian Federal Competition Authority, but thyssenkrupp Group
applied for leniency under the applicable Austrian leniency program and received full immunity from fines in
Austria.

As a result of the European Commission’s decision of February 2007 and the investigation by the Austrian
Federal Competition Authority, thyssenkrupp AG and some of its subsidiaries were subject to private follow-on
litigation. Although final judgments have been issued or settlements have been entered into in the majority of the
cases, we remain exposed to possible joint and several liabilities arising from ongoing claims up to the amount of
€150 million in total in Belgium, the Netherlands and Austria. The Group has made appropriate provisioning for
the sums we may be liable to pay, as well as the costs of the proceedings. We also have an indemnity under the
Share Purchase Agreement of up to €29 million from these claims.

_Civil cartel claims Belgium_

The European Commission is suing the Group jointly and severally with competitors for damages of €6.1 million
plus interest for cartel overcharges of our products in the EU buildings in Belgium. The case was originally
dismissed by the Brussels Commercial Court in 2014 and is currently pending at the court of appeals. We have
made a provision of €2.6 million to cover the risk of this litigation, which is equivalent to 75% of the claimed
amount relating to projects involving thyssenkrupp Elevator, plus potential interest as of September 30, 2019.

_Civil cartel claims the Netherlands_

In 2011, a foundation, Stichting Elevator Cartel Claim (representing, among others, H&M, C&A and NH
Hotels), brought action against us as well as our competitor KONE, for a declaration of liability, alleging cartelrelated damages following the European Commission’s decision of 2007 and claiming damages of €22.3 million
plus interest. The case is currently pending before the District Court of Rotterdam. We have made a provision of
€3.3 million to cover the risk of this litigation, which is equivalent to 50% of the claimed amount relating to
projects involving thyssenkrupp Elevator, plus potential interest as of September 30, 2019.

_Civil cartel claims Austria_

Eight lawsuits by public institutions or corporations and companies (including the City of Vienna, the City of
Linz, the SPAR corporate group and various real estate companies) against the Group jointly and severally with
the other participants of the cartel are currently pending. The total value of the claims is approximately
€117.3 million plus interest, of which claims related to thyssenkrupp Elevator’s projects are approximately
€14.7 million plus potential umbrella claims of €5.1 million. The claimants allege that the cartel in Austria led to
cartel overcharges and umbrella damages in relation to sales by third-party competitors who did not participate in
the cartel. Ultimately, we do not expect to be fully liable for the total amount based on the number of our
products involved but rather for a fraction, if at all, of the value in dispute based on our products involved. We
have made a provision of €20.8 million as of September 30, 2019 to cover the risk of this litigation.

**_Ciacorp International Corporation vs. thyssenkrupp Elevadores, S.A._**

Ciacorp International Corporation sued thyssenkrupp Elevadores, S.A. over an alleged debt of BRL 207 million
(approximately €48 million) owed to some business partners of the former principal shareholder of Sur,
Mr. Aumonde. thyssenkrupp Elevadores S.A. acquired Sur from Aumonde in 1999, and Aumonde’s former
partners in an otherwise unrelated business venture in Uruguay claim that the structure of the Sur acquisition
enabled Aumonde to avoid having liquidity in Brazil, thereby allowing him to escape payment of his debts.
Aumonde’s former partners have brought thyssenkrupp Elevadores, S.A. into the suit by claiming that the
transfer of control of Sur should be found null and void as a fraudulent conveyance, thus returning control of the
company to Aumonde or his holding company, whereby the former partners could then access Aumonde’s
Brazilian assets to cover Aumonde’s debt to them. thyssenkrupp Elevadores, S.A. already won in the local and
regional court. The judgment on the third appeal is pending.

The appeal was allocated to one of the Panel Courts at the Superior Court of Justice in Brasilia.

**_Criminal and administrative proceedings against thyssenkrupp Elevator Korea Ltd._**

Four fatal accidents resulting in five deceased employees of consortium partners (installation companies) of
thyssenkrupp Elevator Korea Ltd. (“thyssenkrupp Elevator Korea”) on four different sites in South Korea in the
years 2018 and 2019 have led to the initiation of criminal and administrative proceedings, inter alia, against
thyssenkrupp Elevator Korea, mainly for indicted non- performance of certain safety measures as the owner of
the business. Three of these proceedings are currently in initial criminal and administrative proceedings in lower
courts, and a fourth has been appealed by the prosecution and by thyssenkrupp Elevator Korea.

In March 2019, the Korean environment and labor committee (“ELC”) of the national assembly began to
investigate these incidents. The ELC ordered (i) a two-week special investigation, which concluded on
November 5, 2019 against the safety management at sites and the legality of certain related contracts and (ii) all
relevant government ministries to audit the four major elevator companies in South Korea for any violations
against certain statutory laws. On November 7, 2019, the ELC conducted an audit where thyssenkrupp Elevator
Korea and the relevant government ministries were present for questioning.

These ongoing administrative proceedings may eventually result in the imposition of administrative sanctions
against thyssenkrupp Elevator Korea for violations of health and safety-related rules as well as construction
industry and elevator regulations governing sub-contracting, specifically on the following grounds:

159


-----

(i) responsibility of thyssenkrupp Elevator Korea as a ‘business owner’ for the infringement of safety-related
rules; and (ii) violation of the 50% rule on subcontracting under the Elevator Act, forbidding the outsourcing of
more than 50% to third parties in connection with maintenance services. The potential sanctions for violation of
the health and safety provisions range from a fine of €0.2 million to suspension of the New Installation business
in South Korea for a period of three to eleven months. The potential sanctions for violation of the provisions of
the Elevator Act range from monetary fine of €0.9 million to a suspension of the Service business in South Korea
for at least two years. thyssenkrupp Elevator Korea, however believes that the relevant authority is considering
limiting penalties for violation of the Elevator Act to fines only, since all major elevator companies are facing
potential violations. In addition to these proceedings, thyssenkrupp Elevator Korea was also facing charges of
violations of certain provisions of the Framework Act on Construction Industry, relating to rules on
sub-contracting, for which it was recently fined €32,000.

In the event that thyssenkrupp Elevator Korea becomes subject to further fines or business suspensions, it must
be compliant with the restriction on subcontracting for a period five years following the imposition, in order to
avoid the revocation of its construction business license.

Due to settlements with the heirs of the deceased, there is no pending civil liability in connection with the
fatalities.

**_Audit of thyssenkrupp North America, Inc. by the State of Delaware_**

In 2011, the state of Delaware initiated an audit of thyssenkrupp North America, Inc., a Delaware corporation,
and its subsidiaries and related entities (collectively, “thyssenkrupp NA”) to determine thyssenkrupp NA’s
compliance with the Delaware Escheats laws, also known as abandoned and unclaimed property laws.

The thyssenkrupp NA audit involves an examination of the books and records of certain large entities within
thyssenkrupp NA (called proxy companies) covering the years 1996 to 2014 (which end date rolls forward every
year that the audit continues and is not completed).

Initial preliminary estimates of liability applicable to thyssenkrupp NA received from Delaware amount to USD
30 million. We have been able to negotiate a settlement agreement with the state of Delaware, which involves an
overall payment of US$7.9 million, of which US$7.2 million is required to be paid by thyssenkrupp Elevator in
connection with the audit, which concluded on December 11, 2019.

**Insurance**

We believe that our businesses have reasonable insurance protection, to the extent customary in the industry. We
are insured under global group policies held by thyssenkrupp AG, including third-party (product) liability,
property damage and business interruption, and directors and officers liability insurance. In addition, there are
local insurance policies to be obtained by us via the thyssenkrupp AG mandated insurance broker. Both, global
group insurance policies and local insurance policies remain to be mandated via the thyssenkrupp AG’s insurance
broker. We are currently in the process of establishing our own global group insurance policies, which would
come into effect on the Acquisition Closing Date, with support of a mandated insurance broker. For further
information on risks related to our insurance coverage, see “Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient and
_insurance premiums may increase.”_

**Compliance and Risk Management**

We control our business and operations with what we believe to be state-of-the-art compliance and risk
management systems. We established a standalone compliance and risk management system specific to
thyssenkrupp Elevator with effect from January 1, 2020. This built-upon and enhanced the existing compliance
program of the thyssenkrupp Group to specific needs of the elevator business. Our risk management system
operates Group-wide and is a fundamental part of our corporate governance system. We continuously seek to
reduce the likelihood and/or potential impact of the various risks to which we are exposed. The aim of our
compliance and risk management system is to enable us to observe all applicable legal regulations, including
those relating to anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, antitrust regulations and data protection on an ongoing
and sustainable basis.

**_Compliance_**

Our compliance program comprises the following three elements: “Inform and Advise,” “Identify,” and “Report
and Act” and focuses in particular on antitrust, anti-corruption, anti-money-laundering, export control and data
protection. It is closely interlinked with risk management and with our internal control system.

160


-----

Central components of the “Inform and Advise” pillar are antitrust law, anti-money laundering, export control
and corruption prevention training programs carried out by the compliance officers as well as compliance advice
given on business transactions and processes. In the training programs, employees are informed about
compliance requirements, risks, and possible sanctions. The requirements are based on law and Group-wide
policies and serve to implement international standards. We keep all our employees informed about compliance
measures and new developments through training, intranet and various forms of communication adapted to target
groups and content. We provide compliance support on important business transactions, for instance in
connection with major projects, acquisitions or the engagement of intermediaries. Our compliance officers also
advise the operating units on integrating compliance into their business processes.

The “Identify” pillar focuses on regularly reviewing critical business operations based on a risk-oriented,
structured audit process. Anti-money laundering screenings of high-risk payments are carried out when red flags
are raised. An additional element is the identification of compliance risks through our whistleblowing system.
Alongside the options of directly contacting a supervisor or the compliance department, this system provides
employees with a further channel for reporting possible infringements of laws or policies without revealing their
identity.

The third pillar, “Report and Act,” encompasses intensive compliance reporting in all three dimensions of our
organizational matrix. We investigate all reports of legal violations. Any violations identified are sanctioned as
necessary, regardless of the name and function of the person involved.

Substantive compliance responsibility in these areas remains with the competent corporate functions and
segments. This ensures that in all areas of the company compliance is understood in accordance with our mission
statement, an intensive exchange of knowledge takes place between the compliance function and those
responsible for content, and the resultant synergies in organization, processes and methods are utilized.

**_Risk Management_**

Our risk strategy is focused on securing our existence and increasing our sustainably. Our business success
requires opportunities to be recognized and associated risks to be identified and evaluated. Our risk strategy
dictates that business risks should be entered into consciously and responsibly and managed proactively by all
employees. Risks threatening our ability to continue as a going concern are to be avoided. The Group bases our
risk management approach on the “Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) Policy” (the “GRC Policy”)
applicable for all consolidated companies of the Group. In this policy, we define basic principles for corporate
governance and risk management and also describe the universally applicable risk policy principles in the Group
as a framework for meeting the requirements of proper, consistent and proactive risk management. The principles
serve as guidelines for professional and responsible risk management. The aims of risk management at the Group
are to increase risk awareness and establish a value-based risk culture at all corporate levels. Risks and
opportunities in the Group are therefore analyzed transparently and are systematically incorporated into business
decisions.

In the GRC Policy, the risk management system methodology is embedded in a “three lines of defense” model.
The first line of defense consists of functions that own and manage risks via management controls and internal
controls. The second line of defense consists of functions such as Controlling, Accounting and Risk, Compliance
and Legal, which oversee risks and help proactively manage them. Additionally, we have a department for our
Internal Control System (“ICS”) responsible for setting ICS strategy and ICS processes at our subsidiaries. The
goal of the ICS is to reduce operational risks, to ensure the reliability of financial reporting and to comply with
laws, policies and internal guidelines. Depending on a company’s size, a control testing or a control selfassessment is annually performed to ensure that controls are implemented and designed to mitigate the
underlying risks. Identified control deficiencies are assessed with regards to their impact and action plans
defined. The third line of defense consists of Corporate Function Internal Audit, which independently reviews the
appropriateness and efficiency of the process and systems implemented by the first two lines of defense. The
“three lines of defense” model is also supplemented by the work of our external financial statement auditors.

The design of various risk management instruments ensures that the sub-processes are integrated in a continuous
risk management loop and all risk managers are involved appropriately in the risk management process. Methods
and tools to identify, assess, control and report risks are implemented throughout the Group and are continually
improved. Our main focus in using risk management instruments is to assess possible deviations in the key
performance indicators such as adjusted EBIT and cash flow.

Standard reporting of estimated opportunities and risks occurs at monthly intervals and once yearly for budget
purposes. The opportunities and risks not included in the monthly updated estimations or in the budget are part of
standard business unit reporting.

161


-----

To record relevant event risks in a structured way in specific areas of responsibility, all Group companies
worldwide use a standardized IT risk management application to prepare risk maps biannually. The assessment
period used for the risk map goes beyond the period covered by the forecast and provides multiple-year
transparency on the local risk assessments. The regular reporting and updating of risks at local level also ensures
that risk awareness remains high throughout the Group. Risks already recognized in the form of balance sheet
provisions are also the subject of standardized analyses and risk reporting, ensuring systematic control of these
risks as well. Ad hoc risks are communicated immediately to the risk management officers and are also
documented via the established reporting channels.

Risks are also further evaluated by the Risk and Internal Control Committee on a regular basis. These
standardized risk management processes ensure that the Management Board and Supervisory Board are informed
promptly and in a structured way about our current risk situation. However, despite comprehensive risk analysis,
the occurrence of risks cannot be systematically ruled out. Risk transfer to insurers is currently handled centrally
by the insurance department of the thyssenkrupp Group and will be taken over by us on the Acquisition Closing
Date. Binding standards are in place for all Group companies to keep risk prevention at a sustainable and
appropriate level. Such standards are updated as required.

**Sustainability and Safety**

**_Sustainability_**

Sustainability is a core component of our corporate strategy. According to Neilsen’s Global Corporate
Sustainability Report, 2015, 66% of consumers are willing to spend more on a product from a sustainable
company. In our strategic sustainability management, we continuously work to identify the requirements of our
stakeholders and develop corresponding targets and measures to improve our performance. Aligned with this
approach on sustainability, at the Group, sustainability means investing in innovative mobility solutions that
tackle the challenges of urbanization while making cities and buildings smarter and the best places to live. It also
involves reducing our operational footprint, increasing our social contribution and ensuring our financial
strength.

We have a “Sustainability Committee,” consisting of members of our Management Board and heads of relevant
functions. This committee manages sustainability activities in the Group and decides on measures and on our
targets. The committee is supported by a Sustainability Council, which consists of sustainability managers of all
the business units and representatives of the relevant functions. The Sustainability Committee has set targets in
the areas of technology and innovations, environment, climate, energy, purchasing, and people. Our targets
include energy and environmental management, annual energy efficiency gains, sustainable adjusted research
and development intensity, a share of women in leadership positions, accident frequency rate and supplier
sustainability audits. Progress towards these targets is factored into variable compensation for our Management
Board and business area boards via a sustainability multiplier. For more information on our management, see
“Management.”

We aim to have our suppliers, along the entire chain, act responsibly and in line with environmental and social
standards based on principles of sustainability. To be able to work with us, suppliers must sign our “Supplier
Code of Conduct” or comply with equivalent standards. The Supplier Code of Conduct addresses possible risks
and negative impacts along the supply chain, including areas such as human rights, fair working conditions,
environmental protection, combating corruption and transparency into the origin of conflict minerals. Based on
standard risk criteria for specific countries and sectors, the business areas select certain suppliers each year in
order to carry out sustainability audits and evaluate compliance with our sustainability principles.

We seek to engage positively with the communities around our locations and to support local residents.
Accordingly, we are actively involved in various local projects, collaborations, multi-stakeholder initiatives and
associations. We promote enthusiasm for technology and innovation, education, and local engagement. To ensure
we maintain high compliance standards in all our work, we have implemented, among other things, a global
documentation and approval system for corporate citizenship activities.

**_Health and Safety_**

The health and safety of employees is of primary importance to us. We seek to reduce the number of workplace
accidents by employing exemplary practices, emphasizing concern for fellow employees, and eliminating unsafe
conditions and potentially dangerous activities. We actively identify safety weaknesses and risks to health in
order to discuss ways of making targeted improvements. We implement improvement ideas and monitors their
effect. We apply detailed regulations and precise controls, notably with respect to the protection of employees,

162


-----

suppliers, service providers, manufacturing processes, plants, research, product development, workflow and
transportation. There is an equal focus on the protection of the environment and the well-being of all who have
contact with our products.

Our goal is to reduce the frequency of workplace accidents and completely eliminate fatal accidents, which
unfortunately still occur. Fatalities increased from six in the year ended September 30, 2018 to ten in the year
ended September 30, 2019. We record and analyze each occupational incident in an effort to eliminate possible
hazard sources. Standardized and systematic procedures, as well as compliance with global regulations, help to
enhance safety. Our plants and processes are subject to continuous review and are kept up-to-date with
state-of-the-art technology. All of our facilities aim to satisfy government requirements for operators of industrial
plants and other facilities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Because many raw materials, services,
technical goods and other supplies have to be sourced from third parties, we work together with all parties
concerned to ensure that deliveries comply with required specifications, standards and regulations.

We have implemented an integrated management system, defining global minimum standards and requirements
according to internationally recognized standards such as ISO 9001 (quality management), ISO 14001
(environmental management), ISO 50001 (energy management) and OHSAS 18001 (occupational health and
safety management) and ISO 45001 (occupational health and safety management).

**Information Technology**

Information Technology (“IT”) is an integral part of our operations, enabling process optimization, productivity
increases and digitalization. Our IT landscape covers the entire business value chain, from research and
development, engineering, manufacturing to New Installations, Services and Modernization. In addition, it
supports the functional roles of finance, human resources, quality, safety, purchasing etc. The key application
platforms include SAP (ERP), PTC Windchill, ConfigIT and VIEW (a proprietary solution for field sales and
operations).

These key applications have been designed as templates and are currently being rolled out globally based on
business priorities and funding, which reduces the complexity of the system landscape and enables the business
to operate at a global level while taking advantage of the substantial operational benefits these modern
technologies offer. The end-to-end integration of these templates enables digitalization initiatives such as IoT,
machine learning and advanced analytics.

We are responsible for the entire infrastructure and application management of all local and global IT systems,
and regularly monitor and update these systems and processes to ensure reliability, compliance, business
continuity and performance. We are moving our application and infrastructure services to the cloud as we refresh
and consolidate to deliver efficient and secure IT operations throughout the service life cycle.

Our core IT governance is managed by global IT functional leaders with each of the business units supporting an
IT organization that is tightly aligned to globally executes the IT strategy and its corresponding templates.
Certain common services are currently provided by thyssenkrupp AG and, after the Acquisition Closing Date,
thyssenkrupp AG will continue to provide the IT Services to us under the New TSAs and otherwise the
Additional Agreements. The IT Services shall continue to be provided essentially in the same manner and scope
as prior to the Acquisition Closing Date. However, we will seek to migrate all provision of the IT Services to our
own independent IT services, either internally or through third parties, in order to support our critical business
functions.

**Joint Ventures**

We are part of several joint venture agreements, primarily with the aim to gain access to markets where this is
required for regulatory reasons (such as the Middle East). We have two material joint venture contracts; the first
is with Marohn thyssenkrupp Elevator Co., Ltd. in China for supplying second-brand products to the Chinese
market, in which we own 51% and the second with Braun thyssenkrupp Elevator LLC, USA, which provides
such services in Wisconsin, USA, in which we own 50%.

**Material Agreements**

Other than the Licensing Agreement, our joint venture agreements with Marohn thyssenkrupp Elevator Co., Ltd.
in China and with Braun thyssenkrupp Elevator LLC, USA, our transitional service agreements and the financing
arrangements described elsewhere herein, there are no industrial, commercial or financial agreements that we
consider material to our business or profitability.

163


-----

**REGULATION**

**Overview**

In all jurisdictions where we operate, our products and services are subject to laws, rules, regulations and
technical standards (collectively “laws”) at international, EU, national, state and municipal levels. In particular,
such laws include laws governing the design, manufacture, installation, operation and product safety of our
products and services, and are mainly outlined in applicable building laws, building codes, specific safety codes
for elevators and escalators and other product safety laws, as well as laws governing airport ground equipment
and airport buildings. These laws differ substantially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In addition, our business is
subject to environmental laws, product warranty and product liability laws, employee health and safety laws,
labor and employment protection laws, intellectual property laws, hazardous substances and chemicals laws,
export control laws, public procurement laws, competition and antitrust laws, tax laws, anti-money laundering
laws, sanction laws, anti-bribery laws, anti- terrorism laws, data protection laws and criminal and other laws. In
the area of environmental regulation, our operations are required to comply with laws and regulations relating to
air, water and noise pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, toxic and other chemicals and materials, waste
treatment and disposal methods, and the energy efficiency of production processes, among other things, in
various jurisdictions in which we operate. We are also subject to periodic monitoring by environmental
protection authorities in various jurisdictions.

For example, at the EU level the legal and regulatory environment in which we operate includes many EU
directives and regulations, which are either applied directly or otherwise implemented in the individual EU
member states through national legislation. By contrast, in the United States numerous federal laws apply at the
national level, while individual states and other more local jurisdictions have their own laws (e.g. building
codes). In addition, international agreements, including bilateral and multilateral agreements between countries
concerning customs duties or other regulations related to the import and export of products, apply directly or
indirectly to us.

The legal and regulatory requirements applicable to us are broad and diverse and may impose conflicting
obligations and limitations on us. The cost of compliance with legal and regulatory requirements may be
significant and we undertake significant efforts to stay up-to-date with all relevant requirements. The most
material laws and regulations applicable to our business operations, broken down by our key jurisdictions (the
EU, the United States and China, based on revenue as well as production output during the financial years
2016/2017 to 2018/2019), and by the general category of regulation, are described in further detail below.
References in this section to any legislation or regulation are deemed to refer to such legislation or regulation as
amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, and all further rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
unless such context requires otherwise.

**Laws governing our products and services**

The laws most relevant to our products and services are mainly contained in the applicable building laws and
product safety laws. The following sets out the most relevant building, product liability and product safety laws
in the jurisdictions of our most important markets.

**_EU and Germany_**

_Product Safety Directive_

Directive 2001/95/EC of the EU Parliament and of the Council of December 3, 2001 (last amended by
Regulation (EC) No 596/2009 of the EU Parliament and of the Council of June 18, 2009) on general product
safety (the “Product Safety Directive”) applies to any product – including in the context of providing a service –
which is intended for consumers or likely, under reasonably foreseeable conditions, to be used by consumers
even if not intended for them, in the absence of specific provisions among the EU regulations governing the
safety of products concerned, or if sectorial legislation is insufficient. Under the Product Safety Directive,
producers and distributors must place on the market only products which comply with general safety
requirements. Therefore, manufacturers must provide consumers with the necessary information in order to
assess a product’s inherent threat, particularly when this is not inherently obvious, and take the necessary
measures to avoid such threats (for example, withdraw products from the market, inform consumers, recall
products which have already been supplied to consumers). Appointed national authorities must monitor the
compliance of products available on the market, ensure product safety legislation and rules are applied by
manufacturers and business chains and apply sanctions when necessary. For example, Regulation (EC) No
765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of July 9, 2008 sets out the requirements for

164


-----

accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products, and its most prominent feature is the
“CE Marking” which can be used to attest the conformity of a product with the applicable requirements of the
relevant legislation.

In addition, the Product Safety Directive introduces an EU rapid alert system for dangerous non-food products.
Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2019/417 sets out guidelines for the management of the EU Rapid
Information System (“RAPEX”), an information system for the rapid exchange of information between the EU
member states and the EU Commission on measures and action taken in relation to products posing a serious risk
to the health and safety of consumers. In addition to RAPEX, the Commission has set up the “Product Safety
Business Alert Gateway,” enabling producers and distributors to report their dangerous products to the relevant
Member State authorities.

_Lifts Directive_

In light of the requirements for certain products and equipment, further directives have been adopted to
harmonize national legislation regarding health and safety requirements across the EU. Of particular importance
to us in this context is Directive 2014/33/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of February 26, 2014
(the “Lifts Directive”), regarding the harmonization of the laws of the Member States relating to lifts and safety
components for lifts (as defined in Annex III of the Lifts Directive). This Lifts Directive on the sale and putting
into service of lifts and safety components for lifts has two key objectives: (i) to allow lifts and their safety
components to be sold throughout the EU market; and (ii) to ensure a high level of safety for lift users and
maintenance staff. It generally applies to all lifts permanently serving buildings and constructions, intended for
the transport of persons and goods, and operating at a speed of more than 0.15 m/s. The Lifts Directive lays down
uniform rules on the sale and putting into service of lifts and safety components for lifts and defines the
responsibilities of manufacturers, importers, distributors, installers and authorized representatives in the context
of the sale of lifts and safety components for lifts. All lifts and safety components for sale in the EU must bear
the CE Marking (as described above) to demonstrate that they meet all essential safety requirements of EU
legislation. Before obtaining the CE Marking, the manufacturer must conduct a safety and conformity assessment
and establish technical documentation for its lifts and components. Lifts and safety components for lifts which
conform with harmonized standards or parts thereof, the references of which have been published in the Official
Journal of the European Union, shall be presumed to conform to the essential health and safety requirements set
out in Annex I of the Lifts Directive covered by those standards or parts thereof. “Harmonized standard,” as
defined in Article 2 No 1 lit. c of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council
of October 25, 2012 on European standardization, means technical specifications, adopted by a recognized
standardization body, for repeated or continuous application, with which compliance is not compulsory, and
which is one of the following: (i) an “international standard” meaning a standard adopted by an international
standardization body; (ii) a “European standard” meaning a standard adopted by a European standardization
organization; (iii) a “harmonized standard” meaning a European standard adopted on the basis of a request made
by the Commission for the application of Union harmonization legislation; and (iv) a “national standard”
meaning a standard adopted by a national standardization body. Of particular importance here are the EN 81-20
and EN 81-50 safety rules for the construction and installation of lifts and EN 13015 specifying how maintenance
must be organized to keep lift safety up to the level required by the Lifts Directive.

_Machinery Directive_

The Lifts Directive does not apply to funicular railways, hoists, escalators, moving walks and low-speed
(< 0.15 m/s) home elevators. These are covered under Directive 2006/42/EC of the European Parliament and of
the Council of May 17, 2006 on machinery and amending Directive 95/16/EC (recast) (the “Machinery
Directive”). The Machinery Directive outlines both compulsory as well as voluntary standards, and only applies
to products when they are first placed on the EU market. This directive covers machinery, interchangeable
equipment, safety components, lifting accessories, chains, ropes and webbing, removable mechanical
transmission devices and partly completed machinery. This directive does not cover other types of machinery,
such as machinery used in fairgrounds, the nuclear industry, laboratories and mines or by the military or police.

_Product Liability Directive_

Council Directive 85/374/EEC of July 25, 1985, as amended by Directive 1999/34/EC of the EU Parliament and
of the Council of May 10, 1999 (the “Product Liability Directive”), applies to movables which have been
industrially produced, whether or not the movables have been subsequently incorporated into another movable or
into an immovable. It establishes the principle of strict liability in cases of damage deemed to be caused by a
defective product. Under a strict liability regime, the producer may be liable even without negligence or fault on

165

its part. “Producer” means the manufacturer of a finished product, the producer of any raw material or the
manufacturer of a component part and any person who, by putting his or her name, trademark or other
distinguishing feature on the product, presents himself as its producer. Producers can be cleared of liability under
certain conditions, notably, if they prove that they did not put the product into circulation, the defect was due to
the compliance of the product with mandatory regulations issued by public authorities or the state of scientific or
technical knowledge at the time that the product was put into circulation could not detect the defect. The Product
Liability Directive applies to damage causing death or personal injuries and damage to private property. It sets
out a time limit of three years for the recovery of damages and forbids clauses limiting or excluding the liability
of the producer. The Product Liability Directive does not restrict compensation for non-material damage under
national legislation.

Within the chain of producers, we are theoretically entitled to seek compensation from our suppliers if the defect
giving rise to product liability stems from a component supplied by such supplier. However, clear responsibility
can be difficult to prove and, in order to maintain good relations to our suppliers, we are often required to refrain
from holding our suppliers accountable.

_Electromagnetic Compatibility Directive_

Directive 2014/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of February 26, 2014 on electromagnetic
compatibility (the “Electromagnetic Compatibility Directive”) aims to ensure that electrical and electronic
equipment complies with an adequate level of electromagnetic compatibility. It outlines uniform rules to ensure
protection against electromagnetic disturbance in order to guarantee the free movement of electrical and
electronic equipment within the EU’s internal market. The equipment covered by the Electromagnetic
Compatibility Directive includes both apparatus and fixed installations. It does not apply to: radio and
telecommunications terminal equipment; aircraft or equipment intended to be installed in aircraft; custom-built
evaluation kits for professional use at research and development facilities; and radio equipment used by radio
amateurs, unless the equipment is made available on the market for the general public.

_Regulation on Market Surveillance and Product Compliance_

On June 20, 2019, Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 on market surveillance and compliance of products (Market
Surveillance Regulation) was adopted by the European legislators. The Market Surveillance Regulation will
apply from 16 July 2021, and will lead to a tightening of conformity checks and additional powers for national
market surveillance authorities. The EU’s stated objective is to reinforce trust in the EU single market by
ensuring compliance with, and enforcement of product legislation in cooperation with customs authorities. The
powers of national market surveillance authorities will include at least (ii) the power to require economic
operators to provide relevant document (including access to embedded software, information on their supply
chain), (ii) the power to enter any premises, and (iii) the power to take samples. The measures implemented by
the Market Surveillance Regulation will particularly have impact on online sales; however, also the elevator
industry is also affected because elevators are also subject to harmonized EU legislation (i.e., Lifts Directive) and
are therefore covered by the Market Surveillance Regulation.

_Public Procurement Directive_

Since we regularly sell our products to public entities in the course of large infrastructure projects, we are also
subject to public procurement laws. Directive 2014/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of
February 26, 2014 on public procurement and repealing Directive 2004/18/EC (the “Public Procurement
Directive”) regulates how public contracts above certain threshold amounts can be awarded by or on behalf of
EU member states’ authorities. Within the meaning of the Public Procurement Directive, procurement is the
acquisition by means of a public contract of works, supplies or services by one or more contracting authorities
from economic operators chosen by those contracting authorities, whether or not the works, supplies or services
are intended for a public purpose. Procurement processes which are subject to the Public Procurement Directive
must comply with the requirements for a specific set of procedures as set out in the Public Procurement
Directive.

_German implementation measures and other material legislation_

In Germany, the Product Safety Directive has been implemented through the Product Safety Act
(Produktsicherheitsgesetz). Section 8 of the Product Safety Act provides for the possibility of issuing ordinances.
In this context, the Lifts Directive was implemented in the 12th ordinance to the Product Safety Act (12. VO zum
_Produktsicherheitsgesetz – Aufzugsverordnung, the “Elevator Ordinance”) and the Machinery Directive in the_

166


-----

ninth ordinance to the Product Safety Act (9. VO zum Produktsicherheitsgesetz, Maschinenverordnung, the
“Machine Ordinance”). Both are essentially aligned to the provisions of the corresponding directives. Section 5
para. 5 of the Elevator Ordinance obliges the installer of an elevator to take “corrective measures”
(Korrekturmaßnahmen), which can be interpreted as more than the warnings which may be sufficient in typical
product safety cases, therefore requiring the installer to provide a fully functional product even after the
expiration of any relevant warranty period, which could in turn result in significant costs for us.

In addition to European standards, technical standards such as DIN 15306 on passenger lifts in residential
buildings and DIN 15309 on passenger lifts in non-residential buildings continue to exist in Germany.

The Product Liability Directive has been implemented through the Product Liability Act
(Produkthaftungsgesetz). Furthermore, the German Civil Code (Bürgerliches _Gesetzbuch) obliges the_
manufacturer of a product to observe and put in place adequate safety precautions. Thereby, defective products
shall be prevented from causing personal injury or damage. In particular, the manufacturer must avoid faults
relating to the design and/or manufacture of the product. Furthermore, the manufacturer must instruct the users
on the intended use of the product. For products that are already on the market, the manufacturer must monitor
how its products are used and must inform the users about potential harmful uses which were not originally
anticipated. According to the legal definition, “manufacturer” is anyone who produces a product, including
suppliers and sub-suppliers. If the manufacturer fails to comply with its obligations, it shall be liable for the
damage incurred. While potential claimants must prove that a product is defective and that this defect caused
personal injury or damage, the manufacturer is obliged to evidentially prove that it has fulfilled its duties relating
to design, manufacture and monitoring of the products as well as regarding adequately informing the users.

The Electromagnetic Compatibility Directive is implemented in Germany via the law on electromagnetic
compatibility of equipment (Gesetz über die elektromagnetische Verträglichkeit von Betriebsmitteln).

In addition, there are regulations on lifts within the German building law (Bauordnungsrecht), specifically with
respect to fire protection regulations.

The Public Procurement Directive is implemented in Germany through several legal acts, in particular, Part IV of
the Act against Restraints of Competition (Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbesbeschränkungen), the Public Procurement
Ordinance (Vergabeverordnung), and the Regulations on Contract Awards for Public Works (Vergabe- und
_Vertragsordnung für Bauleistungen – Teil A, “VOB/A”) which also covers public procurement processes that are_
outside the scope of the Public Procurement Directive.

**_United States_**

_International building Code and regional adaptations_

Building laws in the United States are generally governed by the International Building Code (“IBC”), but most
individual states have made bespoke adoptions of the IBC and have implemented different variations, leading to
a highly fragmented building law landscape. Within the IBC and its local adaptations, there are also varying
provisions governing how our products may be used as part of a building.

_Safety standards from ASME and ANSI_

The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (“ASME”) and the American National Standards Institute
(“ANSI”) are both involved in setting the standards pertaining to how our products may be built and integrated
into an existing structure. The ASME 17.1 elevator and escalator safety code covers the design, construction,
operation, inspection, testing, maintenance, alteration, and repair of hoisting and lowering mechanisms (equipped
with a car or platform) when that hoisting mechanism is located in or adjacent to a structure. This includes
(among others): elevators, power-driven stairways and moving walks, escalators and moving walks, hoisting and
lowering mechanisms, dumbwaiters and cargo lifts. It does not, however, cover personnel hoists, which are
instead covered by ANSI A10.4. Similarly, material hoists are covered by ANSI A10.5 and stairway chairlifts are
covered by ASME A18.1.

_Maintenance standards from ASME and OSHA_

In California, the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (“OSHA”) and ASME work in conjunction to
upkeep maintenance requirements for elevators. In general, state governments monitor elevator certification and
inspections. Periodic maintenance is required on elevators, and certain maintenance, as well as records must be
maintained in order to be certified by the relevant state and local government authorities. ASME, as well as

167


-----

OSHA, requires that all operating components which can be hazardous to individuals must be inspected and
repaired immediately if problems are found. The safety equipment includes door operation, floor-to-floor travel,
acceleration and deceleration of the elevator and emergency and safety equipment.

_Product liability in the United States_

Under US product liability law, manufacturers, distributors, suppliers, retailers, and other parties who make
products available to the public can be held responsible for the injuries deemed to be caused by those products. If
a consumer, user or bystander is injured by a product that is defective or unreasonably dangerous, the
manufacturer or anyone else in the supply chain can be held responsible for that injury. Product liability lawsuits
brought by individual consumers or groups of consumers can become costly and lengthy. No uniform product
liability statute or common law exists in the United States. Each state defines product liability law under its own
standards. However, product liability claims are generally brought under the scope of strict product, tort
(negligence or fraud) and warranty claims. The diversity of product liability law in the United States and the
general availability of punitive damages, class actions and contingency fees create fertile ground for product
liability claims in the United States.

**_China_**

_Safety rules for the construction and installation of electric lifts (GB 7588-2003+XG1-2015)_

The safety rules for the construction and installation of electric lifts (GB 7588-2003+XG1-2015) were
implemented on July 1, 2016 and describe both compulsory and voluntary standards. These standards stipulate
minimum safety requirements which must be followed when manufacturing and installing passenger elevators,
sickbed elevators (for example, in hospitals) and cargo elevators in order to prevent accidents that may injure
passengers or damage cargo when elevators are operating.

_Construction law of the People’s Republic of China_

The Construction Law of the People’s Republic of China must be followed when engaging in construction
activities and in the exercise of supervision and administration over construction activities within the territory of
the People’s Republic of China. The construction activities referred to in this law mean construction of all types
of housing and the construction of their ancillary facilities, as well as the corresponding installation work of
wiring, piping and equipment. Therefore, the provisions of this law on construction works also apply to work
involving elevators, escalators or our other products.

_Law of the People’s Republic of China on bid invitation and bidding_

Certain construction projects to be undertaken within the territory of the People’s Republic of China, including
the surveying, design, construction and supervision of such projects, as well as the purchase of key equipment
and materials for such projects, are subject to bid invitation, which is regulated by the Law of the People’s
Republic of China on Bid Invitation and Bidding. Construction projects that require a formal bid invitation are:
(i) large infrastructure and public utility projects that concern public interests and security; (ii) projects invested
in wholly or partly by state-owned funds or financed by the state; and (iii) projects using loans or aid funds from
international organizations or governments of other countries. Tenders for the above types of elevator projects
are also subject to this law.

_Law of the People’s Republic of China on Product quality_

Anyone who manufactures or sells any product within the territory of the People’s Republic of China shall
comply with the Law of the People’s Republic of China on Product Quality. For the purpose of this regulation,
products are defined as products processed or manufactured for sale. Although the law does not apply to
construction projects, construction materials, structural components and fittings, and equipment that are used for
construction projects are within the scope of the legislation, therefore also covering our products.

_Special equipment safety law of the People’s Republic of China_

The Special Equipment Safety Law of the People’s Republic of China applies to elevators as they fall under the
law’s definition of special equipment. The law applies to the production (including the design, manufacture,
installation, modification and maintenance), operation, use, inspection, testing of and the supervision and
administration of elevators. Elevator recalls are also governed by this law.

168


-----

_Product liability in the People’s Republic of China_

Pursuant to the Product Quality Law of the People’s Republic of China (as promulgated on February 22, 1993,
implemented on September 1, 1993 and amended in 2000 and 2009), the Law of the People’s Republic of China
on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Consumers (as promulgated on October 31, 1993 and amended on
October 25, 2013) and the Tort Law of the People’s Republic of China (as promulgated on December 26, 2009
and implemented on July 1, 2010), a producer shall be responsible for the quality of the products it has produced.
Where any harm is caused by a defective product, the victim may claim for compensation either from the
producers or sellers. If the liability lies on the producers and the compensation has been paid by the sellers, the
sellers have the right to recover their losses from the producers. If the liability lies on the sellers and the
compensation has been paid by the producers, the producers have the right to recover their losses from the
sellers.

**_ISO standards_**

The International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) issues standards that are adhered to internationally.
For example, elevators, escalators and moving walks are governed by ISO 14798, power- operated lifting
platforms for persons with impaired mobility are governed by ISO 9386 and passenger boarding bridges are
governed by ISO 16004.

**Employee Health and Safety**

In all jurisdictions in which we operate, we must comply with applicable laws and regulations to protect
employees against occupational injuries. Under such laws and regulations, employers typically must establish
and maintain working conditions that effectively prevent danger to employees. In particular, employers must
comply with certain medical and hygiene standards, and meet certain health and safety requirements at work,
such as carrying out risk assessments as well as adopting measures for the safety of employees. This is based on,
for example, permissible maximum levels for noise in the workplace, regulations for the use of personal
protective equipment and requirements for ambient temperature, ventilation and lighting, as well as working time
and work break regulations.

**_EU_**

_Minimum Safety and Health Requirements Directive_

According to the Directive 2009/104/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of September 16, 2009,
concerning the minimum safety and health requirements for the use of work equipment by workers at work (the
“Minimum Safety and Health Requirements Directive”), employers must take every measure to ensure the safety
of work equipment made available to workers. In selecting the work equipment, employers must pay attention to
the specific working conditions which exist in the workplace with a view towards the safety and health of
workers. Where risks cannot be fully eliminated in the operation of the work equipment, employers must take
appropriate measures to minimize them. Where EU legislation governing work equipment exists, employers must
ensure that the equipment meets its requirements or, if no such requirements exist, then the equipment must meet
the requirements outlined in Annex I of the Minimum Safety and Health Requirements Directive. Where work
equipment is likely to involve a specific risk to worker health and safety, employers must ensure that access to it
is restricted only to those tasked with using that equipment. Employers must also ensure that only specially
qualified workers carry out repair, modification, maintenance or servicing work. Employers must ensure that
workers are appropriately trained, especially with regard to specific-risk equipment, and are made aware of any
risks which the use of equipment may entail.

In Germany, the “Ordinance on Industrial Safety and Health (Betriebssicherheitsverordnung)” implements the
Minimum Safety and Health Requirements Directive and is further refined by the “Technical rules for
operational safety” (Technische Regeln für Betriebssicherheit – TRBS). The “Act on the Implementation of
Occupational Health and Safety Measures to Improve the Safety and Health Protection of Employees at Work”
(Arbeitsschutzgesetz – ArbSchG) stipulates additional requirements to ensure the safety and health of employees.

**_United States_**

_Occupational Safety and Health Act 29 U.S.C. (1970)_

The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 is a US labor law governing occupational health and safety in
the United States and is administered by OSHA, which is an agency of the United States Department of Labor
that covers most private sector employers and their employees within the United States, as well as individual

169


-----

states. Its primary goal is to ensure that employers provide employees with an environment free from recognized
hazards, such as exposure to toxic chemicals, excessive noise levels, mechanical dangers, heat or cold stress, or
unsanitary conditions. OSHA creates rules which are, together with all other rules created by federal regulatory
agencies, collected into a multi-part document called the Code of Federal Regulations (“CFR”). Individual states
also have established their own occupational health and safety standards, and these are in some cases more
stringent than those promulgated by OSHA. Under the “General Duty Clause” found at Section 5(a)(1) of the
Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are required to provide their employees with a place of
employment that is “free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical
harm.” In addition, most relevant for us are the following standards:

**_OSHA 29 CFR 1910, General Industry Standards: These standards generally apply to employers and employees_**
engaged in general industry, and they cover a broad spectrum of activities, including the production of our
products and provision of our services.

**_OSHA 29 CFR 1926, Construction Standards: These standards apply to employers and employees in the_**
construction industry. The New Installations, the Modernizations and most repair work carried out by us is
governed by these standards.

**_OSHA 29 CFR 1904, Record Keeping Standards: These standards cover the accident and training record-_**
keeping requirements.

_Robotic Industries Association Safety Standards_

The Robotic Industries Association (“RIA”) issues the ANSI/RIA R15.06-2012 safety standard for robotic
equipment. This standard, which is an adoption of ISO 10218:2011 Parts 1 and 2, provides the industry with
guidance on the proper use of safety features embedded within robots, as well as how to safely integrate robots
into factories and work areas. OSHA relies on industry standards such as ANSI/RIA R15.06-2012, when
determining compliance with applicable safety regulations.

_National Fire Protection Association Standards_

OSHA’s electrical standards are based on the National Fire Protection Association (“NFPA”) standards NFPA
70, the National Electrical Code, any regionally adopted standards for the safe installation of electrical wiring
and equipment, and NFPA 70E, the Standard for Electrical Safety in the Workplace, which governs the
manufacturing of our products.

_Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (1976)_

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) gives the United States Environmental Protection
Agency, as well as individual states, the authority to control hazardous waste from cradle-to-grave. This includes
the generation, handling, transportation, treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste. RCRA also sets
forth a framework for the management of non-hazardous solid wastes. RCRA also includes rules on how the
Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS) is applied in the United States,
which in turn also affects our products and services.

**_ISO 45001_**

ISO 45001 is the first international standard on occupational health and safety. It has been developed to improve
employee safety, reduce workplace risks and create better, safer working conditions. ISO 45001 was introduced
in 2018 and has a significant impact on how we organize our health and safety systems.

**Antitrust Law**

We must observe various antitrust laws and regulations applicable in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Of
particular relevance are: provisions on merger control, the prohibition of anti-competitive agreements, collusive
behavior, the prohibition of abuse of a dominant position and the receipt of advantages in violation of state aid
rules within the market. In general, such competition and antitrust laws and regulations are designed to preserve
free and open competition in the marketplace in an effort to enhance competitiveness and economic efficiency.
National and supranational competition and antitrust authorities may initiate investigations and proceedings for
alleged infringements of competition or antitrust laws, which may result in significant fines or other forms of
liability or impose certain limitations or conditions regarding acquisitions and certain business practices.

We have been involved in antitrust proceedings with European authorities and is still subject to certain related
third-party claims. For more information, see “Business—Legal Proceedings—Antitrust proceedings and private
_follow-on litigation.”_

170


-----

Within the EU, compliance with applicable European and national competition laws is monitored by the
European Commission and in some cases the national competition authorities (for instance, in Germany, the
Federal Cartel Office (Bundeskartellamt)). The EU’s antitrust rules are set out in articles 101 and 102 of the
Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (“TFEU”). Article 101(1) of the TFEU prohibits anticompetitive agreements to the extent they are not otherwise exempted by article 101(3) of the TFEU.

The assessment of whether the exemption criteria of article 101(3) of the TFEU are met must be made by us in a
“self-assessment.” This self-assessment of compliance of our agreements with dealers, suppliers or competitors
generally carries the risk that the European Commission, national competition authorities or national courts could
arrive at a different conclusion as to whether there is an infringement of the relevant competition law at issue.

**_Cross-border import and export of our Products_**

Most countries in which we conduct business have import and export control regulations. We manufacture and
handle products which are subject to export control and sanction regulations, as well as trade policy measures
such as tariffs. We are required to comply with sanctions restrictions imposed by multiple authorities, such as the
United Nations, the EU and the United States, in particular with respect to its commercial interactions with
parties in sanctioned countries. In addition, the EU’s, the United States’ and other applicable sanctions and
embargo laws and regulations vary in their application: they do not all apply to the same covered persons or
prescribe the same activities, and such sanctions and embargo laws and regulations may be amended or
strengthened over time.

**_Requirements in Member States of the EU_**

Within the EU’s internal market, the principle of free movement of goods applies. When importing and exporting
goods to non-EU countries, we have to comply with national and European foreign trade and customs
regulations, including applicable trade sanctions law. At the EU level, the relevant regulatory framework
concerning customs is the Union Customs Code (Regulation (EU) No 952/2013). For foreign trade regulations, a
number of EU level regulations and national laws are applicable, as further described further below.

We must also comply with EU compliance screening lists of specific persons and entities per Council
Regulations, including (EC) No 881/2002 and 2580/2001, and with anti-money laundering regulations, including
the Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (EU) 2018/843. The EU has also imposed sanctions on certain
persons, entities and dual-use exports to Russia via Regulation (EU) No 692/2014 and Regulation (EU) No
833/2014. To ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, each Group company screens its transactions
and potential business partners and the export control team at thyssenkrupp AG conducts an additional postscreening of all debtors/creditors to detect any changes on sanctions lists.

**_Requirements under United States laws and regulations_**

In the United States, the US Customs and Border Protection agency, among others, regulates the import of goods
to and the export of goods from the United States. Imports are governed by a number of laws, including the
Tariff Act of 1930. The US Departments of Justice, Commerce, State and Treasury and other federal agencies
and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against corporations
and individuals for violations of economic sanctions laws, export controls laws, anti-money laundering laws and
other federal statutes and regulations, including those established by the US Department of Treasury’s Office of
Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). Various government agencies may seek to impose modifications to business
practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned persons or entities
as well as modifications to compliance programs, which may increase compliance costs, and may subject us to
fines, penalties and other sanctions. A violation of these laws or regulations could adversely impact our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

Our current business in Russia and our former business in Iran, which still involves servicing and warranty
claims, are subject to the regulatory framework of US secondary sanctions. The United States have imposed
primary sanctions on certain Russian individuals, companies and sectors of the Russian economy. As a result of
the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act of 2017, non-US persons must comply with
certain secondary sanctions against Russia, even if such activities have no connection to the US. Among other
things, non-US persons may face penalties for knowingly facilitating significant transactions or significant
financial transactions for or on behalf of a party subject to the United States’ sanctions against Russia.

Moreover, on November 5, 2018, the US announced it would withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of
Action which had previously eased US sanctions on Iran under the authority of, among others, the Iran Sanctions

171


-----

Act, the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability and Divestment Act of 2010, the National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, the Iran
Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act of 2012, and various Executive Orders. In broad terms, the US has
reimposed US extraterritorial sanctions measures against Iran in connection with activity related to Iran’s energy,
petrochemical, automotive, shipping, shipbuilding, port operating, and financial sectors. Persons engaged in such
activities involving Iran will face exposure to secondary sanctions or enforcement actions under US law.
Additionally, the US government has included certain Iranian persons and entities on the Specially Designated
Nationals And Blocked Persons List (“SDN List”) and other sanctions lists as administered by OFAC.

We have some business in Sudan, which is not prohibited under current US (or EU) sanctions. We have however
ceased any new business and are in the process of winding down any existing business in Sudan.

**Data Protection Laws**

Due to the increasingly digital nature of our offerings and its plan to further develop connectivity and
digitalization for its customers, regulations governing the protection of our various stakeholders’ personal data
could have a significant impact on our business.

**_EU and Germany_**

When processing personal data in the European Economic Area, we are subject to the General Data Protection
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”) and the respective implementation legislation in the national laws of the
Member States, which is in Germany the Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz, “BDSG”). Both
the GDPR and BDSG have been applicable since May 25, 2018. The GDPR has significantly changed the legal
framework for data protection in the EU and triggered additional compliance efforts and costs for German
companies in general. The GDPR introduced substantial sanctions for non-compliance. A violation of obligations
under the GDPR may constitute an administrative offense, which can result in fines or investigative measures
imposed by the competent data protection authority, as well as civil liabilities or even criminal sanctions. We
have incurred and expects to continue to incur costs to implement various measures throughout its operations
(including appropriate training of employees, fulfillment of additional documentation duties, adjustments of
processes and monitoring by our data protection and compliance teams) as a result of the GDPR and the national
data protection laws. Furthermore, the GDPR generally requires us to inform the competent supervisory authority
of any breaches of personal data stored or processed by us within 72 hours of becoming aware of such breach.
Where the relevant breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of the affected data subjects,
we are also required to inform these data subjects of such breach without undue delay.

**_United States_**

We are subject to numerous Federal and State privacy laws in the US. These refer to general prohibitions of
unfair or deceiving practices, which includes the prohibition to handle personal data in an unexpected manner, as
well as to data protection in specific sectors. There are specific rules on cybersecurity and data breaches
notification requirements. Each state has developed their own data breach notification requirements. Data privacy
and protection laws are evolving in the U.S. and can vary significantly.

**_China_**

Regarding our activities in China, we are bound by Chinese data privacy law, which consists of numerous laws
and industry-specific regulations, complemented by standards. In addition, data privacy considerations can be
inferred from general principles of civil law including tort law. The legal landscape is complex and subject to
frequent changes. Therefore, uncertainty remains as to the specific application of Chinese data privacy law as
well as to the practical steps needed in order to achieve compliance. In December 2019, China’s authorities
announced new legislation on protection of personal data.

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

In the course of our ordinary business activities, we enter into related party transactions with our shareholders,
companies within the Group, key management personnel and associates. We believe that all transactions with
such parties are negotiated and executed on an arm’s-length basis and that the terms of these transactions are
comparable to those currently contracted with unrelated third-parties.

In addition, we will engage in various financing transactions with our new shareholders and enter into new
related party transactions in connection with the Transactions.

**Ongoing Relationships and Services Provided by the thyssenkrupp Group**

**_Relationship Agreement between the Target and thyssenkrupp AG_**

On December 18, 2019, with effect as of January 1, 2020, the Target and thyssenkrupp AG entered into an
agreement that governs certain general principles regarding the future relationship and cooperation between the
Target and thyssenkrupp AG (the “Relationship Agreement”). The Target and thyssenkrupp AG have agreed to
cooperate, align and collaborate on certain matters in order to allow thyssenkrupp AG, inter alia, (i) to prepare its
consolidated financial statements, prospectuses, other mandatory reports, tax returns and other tax reporting
obligations and budget planning, (ii) to ensure compliance with its organizational and compliance duties and
(iii) to ensure compliance with its reporting and capital markets related obligations.

The Relationship Agreement will be terminated as of the Acquisition Closing Date.

**_Services provided by the thyssenkrupp Group to the Group_**

_Transitional Service Agreements (“TSAs”)_

Certain companies of our Group have entered into 14 TSAs with different companies in the thyssenkrupp Group
(covering entities in Germany, China, USA and Brazil), pursuant to which we receive a number of services, such
as accounting and risk services, IT, procurement, intellectual property, real estate, human resources, legal and
compliance, tax and others (the “Existing TSAs”). The terms under which such services are to be provided and
the respective fees for such services are set out in the relevant Existing TSAs and are effective as of January 1,
2020. Pursuant to the Existing TSAs, the services shall continue to be provided essentially in the same manner,
kind and scope as prior to January 1, 2020.

The Existing TSAs have indefinite terms but are intended to last for a maximum duration of two years from their
effective dates, whereupon the services covered by such Existing TSAs will be transitioned to, and thereafter will
be provided directly by, the Group. The parties to the respective Existing TSAs may terminate the agreement in
whole or in part following a notice period of six months which may be given at the end of each calendar month;
however, such termination notice shall not be delivered within six months after the completion of the Offering.

In accordance with the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, the thyssenkrupp Group and the Group are
negotiating, at arm’s length, necessary amendments to the Existing TSAs to reflect the requirements of the
Acquisition, including scope of services, changes to service charge levels, duration, and liability, as well as
including additional required services or removing certain services. As per the Share Purchase Agreement, this
negotiation process will result in each of the Existing TSAs being amended and restated on the Acquisition
Closing Date (the “New TSAs”). Under the New TSAs, the thyssenkrupp Group will continue to provide a
number of services, including relating to accounting and risk services, IT, procurement, real estate, human
resources, compliance, tax (in certain jurisdictions) and others, to the Group, following the Acquisition. The New
TSAs will supersede the Existing TSAs and will include this reduced selection of services to reflect the build-up
of internal resource in the Group by the Acquisition Closing Date. The duration of each New TSA after the
Acquisition Closing Date varies based on the scope and necessary support for each service.

In addition to the Existing TSAs, certain companies of our Group have entered into over 500 different agreements
with companies in the thyssenkrupp Group pursuant to which we receive a number of additional services and/or
provide services to the thyssenkrupp Group (the “Additional Service Agreements”). The majority of these services
are IT services and services of thyssenkrupp AG’s global shared services centers (GSS). Although a process is
underway to terminate a significant number of the Additional Service Agreements prior to the Acquisition Closing
Date, many of the Additional Service Agreements are expected to continue after the Acquisition Closing Date. In
relation to those Additional Service Agreements which will not terminate prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, the
thyssenkrupp Group and the Group are negotiating, at arm’s length, the extension of the minimum duration of
various critical services provided by the thyssenkrupp Group under the Additional Service Agreements to allow a
sufficient period to migrate those critical services away from the thyssenkrupp Group.

**Relationships with the thyssenkrupp Group in the Past**
Historically, we have entered into certain operational and financial transactions with certain subsidiaries of the
thyssenkrupp Group in the ordinary course of business. Below are descriptions of certain of these key
transactions. For further details on our relationship with the thyssenkrupp Group, see Note 22 of the Audited
Combined Financial Statements.

_Service agreements_
Prior to the separation of the Target from the thyssenkrupp Group, service agreements concluded on an arm’s
length basis were in place to regulate the provision of various services. In addition to these contractual services,
additional costs mainly related to general overhead functions such as accounting and risk, IT, procurement,
intellectual property, real estate, human resources, legal and compliance, tax and other functions of the
thyssenkrupp Group have been allocated based on certain allocation metrics such as revenue contribution of the
Group in relation to the thyssenkrupp Group for the past. These corporate cost allocations amounted to
€98 million, €71 million and €66 million in the years ended September 30, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. It
is intended that, with effect from the Acquisition Closing Date, the New TSAs will replace some of these
agreements and general services, whereas the existing contractual services will continue until the services
covered by them can be transitioned to the Group or to other third party service providers.

_License Agreement_
On September 25, 2019, against the background of a then-proposed initial public offering, thyssenkrupp Elevator
Innovation entered into a brand licensing agreement with thyssenkrupp AG (the “Brand Licensing Agreement”),
allowing thyssenkrupp Elevator Innovation and its subsidiaries to indefinitely use certain trademarks, including
the trademark “thyssenkrupp” in carrying out the business of the Group, against payment of a one-time fee of
€1,080 million. Subsequently, in light of the Acquisition, thyssenkrupp AG, thyssenkrupp Elevator Innovation
and thyssenkrupp Elevator have entered into an addendum agreement (“License Addendum”) to the Brand
Licensing Agreement, pursuant to which thyssenkrupp AG will refund the original license fee paid to it under the
Brand License Agreement. thyssenkrupp Elevator Innovation has agreed to pay a compensation for use of
€172.8 million, of which €98.7 million relates to the period until the Acquisition Closing Date and €74 million
relates to the period thereafter. The refund of the original license fee (together with applicable value added tax)
by thyssenkrupp AG and the payment of the compensation for use by thyssenkrupp Elevator Innovation, are
being settled through intercompany accounts. The Brand License Agreement, as supplemented by the License
Addendum, will be automatically terminated 18 months after the Acquisition Closing Date.

_Guarantees/surety bonds_
The thyssenkrupp Group has provided guarantees and surety bonds aggregating to €1,228 million in favor of the
Group as of March 31, 2020, of which €97 million relate to corporate guarantees and €1,131 million to bank
guarantees and surety bonds.

_Financing_
Historically, the Group was integrated into the cash pooling and cash management systems of the thyssenkrupp
Group. In the six months ended March 31, 2020, the interest expenses and interest income generated in
connection with such financing activities with thyssenkrupp AG and the remaining thyssenkrupp Group
amounted to €28 million and €14 million, respectively.
Under the Share Purchase Agreement, all existing intercompany finance agreements between the Group and the
thyssenkrupp Group shall be terminated at least three business days prior to the Acquisition Closing Date.
Further, any outstanding balances under such intercompany finance agreements are required to be settled on or
prior to the Acquisition Closing Date in the manner provided under the Share Purchase Agreement.

_Leasing_
Historically, the Group entered into leasing transactions with the thyssenkrupp Group. As of September 30, 2019,
these consisted in particular of operating lease agreements and the finance lease of the test tower in Rottweil,
Germany with respect to real estate. The lease agreement regarding the test tower in Rottweil is expected to
terminate on the Acquisition Closing Date and thereafter, the title would be transferred to the Group.

**Management Equity Participation Program**
We intend to establish the structure for a management equity participation program prior to the Acquisition
Closing Date to which certain managers of the Group will be able to subscribe to after the Acquisition Closing
Date. The subscribing managers will be invested through a vehicle in the form of a German limited partnership
(GmbH&Co KG) which will hold securities in a Luxembourg holding company of the SUN Issuer and will be
expected to enter into certain customary documentation.

**PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS**

The Target is an Aktiengesellschaft incorporated under the laws of Germany. Following the completion of the
Acquisition, the Target will be fully owned by Bidco and it is intended that its legal form will be changed to a
_Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung._

Bidco is a Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung incorporated under the laws of Germany and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Newco, a Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung incorporated under the laws of Germany. Newco
is a wholly owned subsidiary of the EUR SSN Issuer, a Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung incorporated
under the laws of Germany, which in turn is a wholly owned subsidiary of the SUN Issuer, a Gesellschaft mit
_beschränkter Haftung incorporated under the laws of Germany. The SUN Issuer is indirectly owned by Vertical_
Topco, a société à responsabilité limitée incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg. The USD SSN Issuer is a
corporation incorporated under the laws of Delaware and a wholly owned subsidiary of Newco.

Bidco, Newco, the Issuers and Vertical Topco were incorporated as holding companies for the purpose of the
Acquisition by entities controlled by Advent and the Cinven Funds, who will together have controlling voting
rights in the Group. It is expected that thyssenkrupp AG or one or more of its affiliates will invest in an indirect
parent company of Bidco to retain a minority interest of approximately 19% in the Group. Following the
Acquisition Closing Date and thyssenkrupp AG’s reinvestment, we expect that Advent will hold approximately
26%, the Cinven Funds will hold approximately 26%, Luxinva will hold approximately 13%, Auba will hold
approximately 9% and RAG-Stiftung will hold approximately 8%, respectively, in the Group. The foregoing
shareholding percentages are indicative and may be subject to variations, including as a result of the addition of
other co-investors of the Group.

transactions or other contractual obligations entered into in the ordinary course of business of the Senior Secured
Group (where, for the avoidance of doubt, any such instruments may be drawn under the Guarantee Facility
directly in favor of beneficiaries or indirectly in favor of beneficiaries (by way of “back-to-back” or equivalent
arrangements)) provided that each such Bank Guarantee covers liabilities in relation to advance payments,
performance of contracts, bidding processes or other obligations in ordinary course of business where the
instrument itself or the underlying obligation to which it relates does not constitute Indebtedness (including
payment obligations in relation to an acquisition, investments, capital expenditures, obligations in relation to
employee overtime accounts (Ansprüche der Arbeitsnehmer aus Überstunden auf Arbeitszeitkonten), the
protection of credits under partial retirement schemes from insolvency (Zahlungsavale zur Insolvenzsicherung
_von Wertguthaben aus Altersteilzeit) or (iii) to counter-indemnify any local facility provided by a branch or_

Loans under the Original Senior Credit Facilities will initially bear interest at rates per annum equal to
EURIBOR or, for loans denominated other than in Euro, the applicable IBOR, plus an applicable margin, which
in each case will be subject to a decreasing margin ratchet based on the ratio of consolidated senior secured net
debt to consolidated pro forma EBITDA (each as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) (the “Senior
Secured Net Leverage Ratio”).
If EURIBOR is less than zero, EURIBOR shall be deemed to be zero in respect of loans made under TLB1 or the
Revolving Credit Facility (as applicable). If another IBOR, including LIBOR is less than zero, LIBOR shall be
deemed to be zero in respect of loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility, Facility A or TLB2 (as
applicable).
A commitment fee will be payable (A) on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the Revolving
Credit Facility from the Closing Date to the end of the availability period applicable to the Revolving Credit
Facility at a rate of 30% of the applicable margin for the Revolving Credit Facility; and (B) on the aggregate
undrawn and uncancelled amount of the Guarantee Facility from the Closing Date to the end of the availability
period applicable to the Guarantee Facility at a rate of 30% of the applicable margin for the Guarantee Facility.
Such commitment fees will be payable quarterly in arrears (provided that the EUR SSN Issuer may elect that
accrued commitment fee shall instead be paid on each Quarter Date or the last date of each Interest Period
applicable to a Facility B), on the last day of the availability period applicable to the Revolving Credit Facility or
Guarantee Facility (as applicable) and on the date the Revolving Credit Facility or Guarantee Facility (as
applicable) is cancelled in full or on the date on which the relevant lender cancels its commitment.

-----

Any letter of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility shall be subject to such issuing bank and fronting
fees as may be agreed between the Company and the applicable issuing bank and a letter of credit fee equal to the
margin that would have been applicable to a cash drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility in the applicable
currency.

Any Bank Guarantee issued under the Guarantee Facility shall be subject to certain fees (including with respect
to a fronted Bank Guarantee, fees agreed with the relevant issuing bank and fronting fees as may be agreed
between the Company and the applicable issuing bank and certain other customary bank guarantees fee), subject
to certain conditions as set out in the Senior Facilities Agreement.

**_Repayments_**

The Loans under Facility A will be repaid in instalments by repaying an agreed amount on each Quarter Date
following a repayment holiday of up to three years and the balance on the maturity date which shall be no longer
than seven years.

The loans made under TLB1 will be repaid in full on the date that is seven years from the Closing Date.

The loans made under TLB2 will be repaid in instalments by repaying on each Quarter Date (commencing, with
respect to each Facility B (USD) Loan, with the last day of the first full Financial Quarter ending after the
Closing Date) an amount which reduces the principal amount of such loans drawn during the availability period
by 0.25 per cent of their outstanding principal amount from time to time, with the balance to be repaid in full on
the date that is seven years from the Closing Date.

In respect of the Revolving Credit Facility, each advance will be repaid on the last day of the interest period
relating thereto, subject to an ability to roll over cash drawings. All outstanding amounts under the Revolving
Credit Facility will be repaid on the termination date of the Revolving Credit Facility, being the date falling six
and a half years from the Closing Date. Amounts repaid by the borrowers on loans made under the Revolving
Credit Facility may be reborrowed, subject to certain conditions.

In respect of the letters of credit, each will be repaid on the termination date of the relevant Revolving Credit
Facility, being the date falling six and a half years from the Closing Date (or such earlier date in accordance with
the Senior Facilities Agreement), provided that if any letter of credit has an expiry date ending on or after the
termination date applicable to the applicable Revolving Credit Facility, on such termination date each letter of
credit shall be repaid unless the relevant issuing bank agrees that such letter of credit shall continue as between
that issuing bank and the relevant member of the Senior Secured Group on a bilateral basis and not as part of or
under the documentation for the Senior Secured Facilities.

In respect of the Guarantee Facility, unless otherwise agreed with the issuing bank of any specific Bank
Guarantee, each Bank Guarantee shall be repaid by the borrower of that Bank Guarantee on the termination date
for the Guarantee Facility, being the date falling six and a half years from the Closing Date (or such earlier date
in accordance with the Senior Facilities Agreement), provided that if any Bank Guarantee has an expiry date
ending on or after the termination date for the Guarantee Facility, on the termination date for the Guarantee
Facility each such Bank Guarantee shall be repaid unless, in the case of a Bank Guarantee with an expiry date
falling after the maturity date for the Guarantee Facility, the relevant issuing bank agrees that such Bank
Guarantee shall continue as between that issuing bank and the relevant member of the Senior Secured Group on a
bilateral basis and not as part of or under the documentation for the Senior Secured Facilities.

**_Voluntary and Mandatory Prepayment_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement will permit voluntary prepayments to be made (subject to de minimis amounts)
and will require mandatory prepayment in full or in part in certain circumstances, including:

- from certain net cash proceeds received by the EUR SSN Issuer and any of its restricted subsidiaries (the
“Senior Secured Group”) from certain asset disposals, to the extent not otherwise applied for a permitted
purpose and required to be applied in prepayment of the Senior Credit Facilities and subject to a de minimis
amount and other customary carve outs substantially similar to the Notes as described in the section entitled
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes”; and

- unless otherwise agreed by the majority lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement, for each financial
year (commencing with the first full financial year following the Closing Date), a percentage of excess cash
flow in the event that excess cash flow exceeds a minimum threshold amount (subject to certain adjustments
based on anticipated debt service, distributions to be paid to minority shareholders and certain other
expenses), which percentage decreases as the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio decreases (an “Excess
Cash Flow Prepayment”).

182


-----

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement which follows terms
substantially similar to the Notes as described in the section entitled “Description of the Senior Secured Notes”),
at the EUR SSN Issuer’s option, either (i) each lender, issuing bank and bank guarantee issuing bank shall be
entitled to require prepayment of outstanding amounts and cancellation of its commitments within a prescribed
time period or (ii) all outstanding undrawn commitments of each lender shall be cancelled and outstanding drawn
commitments shall become due and payable. A change of control shall include:

- any person or group (other than one or more permitted holders) becoming the beneficial owner of more than
50% of the voting power of the SSN Issuers other than in connection with a transaction or series of
transactions in which the SSN Issuers shall become the wholly owned subsidiary of a Parent Entity (as
defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) subject to certain conditions;

- the SUN Issuer ceasing to directly own 100% of the total issued share capital of the EUR SSN Issuer (or any
successor entity as a result of certain mergers permitted under the Senior Facilities Agreement);

- on a disposal of all or substantially all the assets of the Senior Secured Group taken as a whole to a person
other than a restricted subsidiary or one or more permitted holders.

At the EUR SSN Issuer’s option, the EUR SSN Issuer may prepay any other indebtedness of the Senior Secured
Group which is permitted (including, junior or junior secured indebtedness) in priority if such prepayment would
comply with the restricted payments covenant.

The Revolving Credit Facility and the Guarantee Facility shall not be entitled to any mandatory prepayment
proceeds (other than a mandatory prepayment as a result of a Change of Control).

If a lender waives its right (such right shall be at the EUR SSN Issuer’s request only) to receive its share of any
prepayment of the Senior Secured Facilities (“Waived Amounts”), such Waived Amounts may be retained by the
Senior Secured Group for any purposes not prohibited by the Senior Facilities Agreement (including restricted
payments), may be offered to any lender(s) selected by the EUR SSN Issuer which did not decline such
prepayment or applied in prepayment of any other permitted indebtedness.

**_Guarantees and Security_**

_Guarantor Coverage Test and Material Subsidiaries_

The Senior Secured Facilities will be guaranteed by each borrower of the Senior Secured Facilities (the
“Borrowers”) and the Guarantors (together, the “Senior Secured Obligors”).

Although the Notes will not be guaranteed or secured by any guarantors incorporated in Spain due to applicable
financial assistance rules and other applicable guarantee limitations and applicable laws, certain of the Target’s
subsidiaries in Spain will become obligors (as borrowers or guarantors) under the Senior Facilities Agreement
and, subject to the agreed security principles and the guarantee limitations, shall guarantee the Senior Facilities
under the Senior Facilities Agreement and shall grant security (subject to the agreed security principles) in favor
of the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement in respect of the Senior Facilities.

Subject to agreed security principles in the Senior Facilities Agreement, the following security shall be granted a
condition precedent to the availability of the Original Senior Credit Facilities: (a) the SUN Issuer shall grant
limited recourse (i) share pledge in respect of its shares in the capital of the EUR SSN Issuer and (ii) security
agreement assigning any structural intercompany receivables owed to the SUN Issuer (as lender) by the EUR
SSN Issuer (as borrower); (b) the EUR SSN Issuer shall grant: (i) a share pledge in respect of its shares in
Newco; (ii) security agreement assigning any structural intercompany receivables owed to the EUR SSN Issuer
(as lender) by Newco (as borrower); and (iii) a bank account pledge agreement pledging its material bank
accounts in Germany (without control over use and freely operational prior to acceleration); (c) Newco shall
grant: (i) share pledges in respect of its shares in (x) Bidco and (y) in the USD SSN Issuer; (ii) security
agreements assigning any structural intercompany receivables owed to Newco (as lender) by (x) Bidco (as
borrower) and (y) US Newco (as borrower); and (iii) a bank account pledge agreement pledging its material bank
accounts in Germany (without control over use and freely operational prior to acceleration); (d) the USD SSN
Issuer shall grant a US law general security agreement (subject to customary exclusions); and (e) Bidco shall
grant a bank account pledge agreement pledging its material bank accounts in Germany (without control over use
and freely operational prior to acceleration).

Subject to certain adjustments and agreed security principles in the Senior Facilities Agreement, the EUR SSN
Issuer is required to ensure that members of the Senior Secured Group incorporated in a Guarantor Jurisdiction
(i) that generate at least 80% of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the section entitled “Description of the

183


-----

_Senior Secured Notes”) of the Senior Secured Group within certain agreed jurisdictions (“Guarantor_
Jurisdictions”), namely, Australia, Canada, any member state of the EU, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Norway,
Singapore, Switzerland, the UK, the US (including any state thereof and the District of Columbia) and the
jurisdiction of incorporation of any borrower (the “Guarantor Coverage Test”) and (ii) that individually generate
more than 5% of LTM EBITDA of the Group (a “Material Subsidiary”), in each case, are guarantors under the
Senior Facilities Agreement within 150 days of the Closing Date and thereafter on an ongoing basis within 120
days of the date on which the annual financial statements of the EUR SSN Issuer (or other applicable financial
reporting entity) are required to be delivered to the agent under the Senior Facilities Agreement.

As part of the guarantor accession process, security shall be granted (subject to the agreed security principles):
(a) over the shares of such acceding guarantor by a member of the Senior Secured Group who is its shareholder
incorporated in a Guarantor Jurisdiction; and (b) if the relevant acceding guarantor is incorporated in (i) the
United States, Canada, Australia, England and Wales, Hong Kong, New Zealand, the Republic of Ireland,
Singapore or any other jurisdiction where floating security is customarily granted in connection with top tier
acquisition financings (as determined by the EUR SSN Issuer acting reasonably) shall grant floating security
over substantially all assets located in its jurisdiction of incorporation (subject to customary exclusions,
“excluded assets” including real estate) and in each case only to the extent to do so would not have a material
adverse effect on the ability of the relevant company to conduct their business and operations (as determined by
such company in its sole and absolute discretion).

_Release of Guarantees and Security_

In addition to the circumstances described below under “—Intercreditor Agreement—Distressed Disposals” and
“—Intercreditor Agreement—Non-distressed Disposals,” the EUR SSN Issuer may, subject to certain conditions,
request the release of a guarantor from its guarantee under the Senior Facilities Agreement if (i) such guarantor is
the subject of a third-party disposal or other permitted activity under the Senior Facilities Agreement pursuant to
which such guarantor will cease to be a member of the Senior Secured Group, (ii) on a pro forma basis taking
into account such release, the Guarantor Coverage Test will continue to be satisfied or (iii) the lenders whose
commitments under the Senior Facilities Agreement aggregate greater than 50% of the total commitments under
such facilities consent to such release. Upon the effectiveness of a release pursuant to the foregoing sentence, the
applicable guarantor would have no further obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement, including any
obligations to grant Security in any Collateral owned by such guarantor.

The provision and the terms of the security and guarantees set forth above will in all cases be subject to certain
limitations and are at all times and in all cases subject to the requirements of applicable law and the other matters
set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Facilities Agreement.

**_Representations and Warranties_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement contains certain representations and warranties (subject to certain agreed
qualifications and with certain representations being repeated), including: (i) status, (ii) binding obligations,
(iii) non-conflict with other obligations, (iv) power and authority, (v) validity and admissibility in evidence,
(vi) governing law and enforcement, (vii) filing and stamp taxes, (viii) information memorandum, management
case and reports, (ix) financial statements, (x) no litigation, (xi) taxation, (xii) pari passu ranking,
(xiii) investment company act, (xiv) margin regulations and (xv) ERISA.

Certain representations and warranties were made on the Closing Date and will be repeated on the date of each
utilization, on the first day of each interest period and at certain other times.

**_Springing Financial Covenant_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement contains a springing senior secured net leverage financial covenant (“Financial
Covenant”) solely for the benefit of the lenders participating in the Revolving Credit Facility, the Guarantee
Facility and any applicable Incremental Senior Secured Facilities (together the “Financial Covenant Facilities”),
set at a flat ratio whereby the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio as set out in the relevant compliance certificate
delivered to the agent under Senior Facilities Agreement shall not exceed 9.31:1

The Financial Covenant will be on an LTM basis on each financial quarter date on or after the first testing date (a
“Test Date”), provided that the Senior Secured Group will only be required to test the Financial Covenant if as of
5.00 p.m. (in London) on a Test Date, the amount of: (a) all loans under the Financial Covenant Facilities
(excluding: (i) loans to fund any original issue discount or flex-related payments with respect to Original Term
Facilities and any Incremental Senior Secured Facility which is a term facility; (ii) loans made on or prior to the

184


-----

Closing Date; (iii) loans used to fund any acquisitions, capital expenditure or other investments (and, in each
case, any rollover loan in respect thereof)) and (iv) (for the avoidance of doubt) any amounts drawn under the
Revolving Credit Facility by way of ancillary facilities and letters of credit (or bank guarantees)); plus (b) the
aggregate amount of any Bank Guarantees issued under each Guarantee Facility which is a Financial Covenant
Facility which have been called by the beneficiaries of such Bank Guarantees and have not been reimbursed by
(or on behalf of) the borrowers to the relevant lender(s) as at such Test Date or from a loan under a Facility
which has been requested as at such Test Date and which will reimburse such lender(s); minus (c) any cash and
cash equivalent investments of the Senior Secured Group, exceeding 40% of the aggregate of: (i) the total
commitments of the Revolving Credit Facility as at the date of the Senior Facilities Agreement; and (ii) the
aggregate of all commitments under any Incremental Senior Secured Facility which is a revolving facility and a
Financial Covenant Facility established after the date of the Senior Facilities Agreement, (disregarding, in each
case, any reduction in such commitments following the establishment thereof) (the “Test Condition”).

The Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio is based on the definitions and adjustments in the Senior Facilities
Agreement, which may differ from similar definitions in the Indenture and the equivalent definitions described in
this offering memorandum.

The Senior Facilities Agreement contains an equity cure provision enabling the EUR SSN Issuer to cure or
prevent breaches of the Financial Covenant (an “Equity Cure”) by the contribution from its shareholders or any
other person of additional equity, assets and/or subordinated loans (“Cure Amount”) to (i) increase the
consolidated pro forma EBITDA under the Senior Facilities Agreement, (“EBITDA Cure”) (ii) decrease
consolidated senior secured net debt as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement, or (iii) prepay the Revolving
Credit Facility (“Prepayment Cure”) or reimburse any amount called under the Guarantee Facility so that the Test
Condition is no longer satisfied. The EBITDA Cure equity cure right may not be exercised on more than five
occasions during the term of the Senior Facilities Agreement and no more than two EBITDA Cures may be made
in any three consecutive relevant periods. Such Equity Cure must be exercised prior to the date falling 20
Business Days after the date on which the compliance certificate is required to be delivered.

There shall be no obligation to use any Cure Amount (other than with respect to a Prepayment Cure) in
prepayment of the Senior Secured Facilities.

If the Financial Covenant has been breached, but is complied with when tested on any subsequent Test Date or is
otherwise not required to be tested due to the Test Condition not being met on any subsequent date, then, the
prior breach of such Financial Covenant or any event of default arising therefrom shall be deemed cured unless
the requisite super-majority lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility have exercised their acceleration rights
to declare all or part of the loans under the Revolving Credit Facility to be immediately due and payable.

The EUR SSN Issuer may elect to re-test the Test Condition or Financial Covenant for any period at any time
based upon any financial statements (including the latest internally available financial information for an LTM
period) and, if the Test Condition is not met or the Financial Covenant is complied with at such time (due to
prepayments of the RCF, cash or cash equivalents on balance sheet or otherwise), the Financial Covenant shall be
deemed complied with and any prior breach of such Financial Covenant or any Event of Default arising
therefrom shall be deemed cured. For any such calculation, the EUR SSN Issuer may give pro forma effect to all
applicable transactions (and permitted adjustments to any Applicable Metric in connection therewith) for which
the Applicable Transaction Date has occurred following the end of the Applicable Period or any subsequent
Relevant Period as if such Applicable Transaction had been consummated on the first day of such Applicable
Period or Relevant Period (as applicable)

**_General Undertakings_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement contains certain of the incurrence covenants, information undertakings and
related definitions (with, in each case, certain adjustments), including (i) limitations on indebtedness;
(ii) limitations on restricted payments; (iii) limitations on liens (which includes a restriction on designating
certain credit facilities and/or hedging obligations secured on the Collateral as Super Senior Liabilities (as
defined in the section entitled “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”)
unless, prior to such designation, Facility B has been refinanced in full (ignoring any participation (x) of a lender
which has been rolled over in a refinancing (or otherwise) of Facility B and/or (y) in respect of which a lender
has declined prepayment)); (iv) limitation on restrictions on distributions from restricted subsidiaries;
(v) limitations on sale of assets and subsidiary stock; (vi) limitations on affiliate transactions; (vii) designation of
restricted and unrestricted subsidiaries (viii) merger and consolidation undertakings with respect to (x) the EUR
SSN Issuer (y) the USD SSN Issuer and (z) the guarantors of the Senior Secured Facilities; and (ix) additional
intercreditor agreements.

185


-----

In addition, the Senior Facilities Agreement also requires the EUR SSN Issuer and certain of its restricted
subsidiaries to observe certain other customary positive and negative covenants, subject to certain exceptions and
grace periods, including covenants relating to: (i) authorisations and consents; (ii) compliance with laws; (iii) pari
passu ranking; (iv) taxes; (v) centre of main interests; (vi) guarantees and security; (vii) further assurance;
(viii) anti-corruption law and sanctions; (ix) ratings; (x) compliance with ERISA; and (xi) certain post-closing
undertakings (including the conversion of the Target from an AG to GmbH within 90 days from the Closing Date
and completion of certain steps in the tax structure memorandum).

The Senior Facilities Agreement also required the Company to comply with certain customary information
undertakings, including delivery of quarterly and annual financial statements and accompanying compliance
certificates, provided that the obligation to deliver financial information may differ from similar requirements in
the Indenture and as described in this offering memorandum.

It is intended that certain agreed covenants and other provisions of the Senior Facilities Agreement will fall-away
permanently upon the satisfaction of certain release conditions, being (i) the occurrence of a listing in respect of
which the Senior Secured Group’s Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio does not exceed 4.50:1; (ii) the EUR SSN
Issuer having a long-term corporate credit rating equal to or higher than Baa3 according to Moody’s Investor
Services Limited or BBB- according to Standard & Poor’s Rating Services or Fitch; or (iii) Facility B receives a
rating equal to or higher than Baa3 according to Moody’s Investor Services Limited or BBB- according to
Standard & Poor’s Rating Services or Fitch.

**_Events of Default_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement provides for substantially the same events of default as under the Notes. In
addition, the Senior Facilities Agreement provides for additional events of default, subject to customary
materiality qualifications and grace periods, including (i) breach of the financial covenant, provided that (A) in
the event of such breach, only the requisite super-majority of the lenders under the Senior Secured Revolving
Facilities (the “Super-majority Revolving Facility Lenders”) may exercise acceleration rights as a result of such
breach and (B) if the Super-majority Revolving Facility Lenders have exercised such acceleration rights as a
result of such breach, the remaining lenders shall have a right of cross-acceleration; (ii) misrepresentation; (iii)
invalidity and unlawfulness of the Senior Secured Facilities financing documents; and (iv) material failure to
comply with the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Governing Law_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it, are
governed by, construed in accordance with and will be enforced in accordance with English law although the
restrictive covenants, events of default and related definitions scheduled to the Senior Facilities Agreement will
be interpreted in accordance with New York law (without prejudice to the fact that the Senior Facilities
Agreement is governed by English law).

**Cash Bridge Facility**

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the EUR SSN Issuer is engaged in negotiations with certain
financing providers to obtain commitments for an onshore/offshore credit facility and standby letter of credit in
an amount up to €350 million and with a tenor of up to five or more years to be provided to the Target or one or
more of its affiliates (the “Cash Bridge Facility”). Proceeds from the Cash Bridge Facility would be provided to
the Target, and would be available for further distribution to the Sponsors, to reimburse amounts paid in
connection with the Acquisition in respect of cash held as of the Acquisition Closing Date by certain subsidiaries
of the Target organized in the People’s Republic of China. The Cash Bridge Facility, if it is entered into, is
expected to contain customary terms and conditions and to provide for the payment of interest and customary
fees to such financing providers. No assurance can be given that commitments in respect of the Cash Bridge
Facility will be obtained or that funding under the Cash Bridge Facility will occur.

**Intercreditor Agreement**

**_General_**

To establish the relative rights of certain of our creditors under our financing arrangements, the EUR SSN Issuer,
the SUN Issuer, certain Guarantors and the Trustee are party to and certain other Guarantors will accede to an
Intercreditor Agreement between, among others, the agent, arrangers and lenders under the Senior Facilities
Agreement and the Security Agent.

186


-----

By accepting a Note, holders of the Notes will be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms and
conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English law and sets out various matters governing the relationship
of the creditors to our group including the relative ranking of certain debt of the EUR SSN Issuer, the SUN
Issuer, the Guarantors and any other person that becomes party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Debtor or
Third Party Security Provider (as defined below), when payments can be made in respect of debt of the Debtors
or Third Party Security Providers, when enforcement action can be taken in respect of that debt, the terms
pursuant to which certain of that debt will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events and
turnover provisions and provisions related to the enforcement of shared security.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions contained in the Intercreditor Agreement. It does
not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety and we urge you to read that document because it, and not

Liabilities, Super Senior Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Cash Management Facility Liabilities,
Hedging Liabilities, Second Lien Lender Liabilities and Second Lien Notes Liabilities, Agent Liabilities and
Notes Liabilities and to any arranger in connection with the aforementioned liabilities (such creditors, together

(other than any Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities) to a holding company of the EUR SSN Issuer or to any other
person who becomes a subordinated creditor (a “Subordinated Creditor”) under the Intercreditor Agreement (the

(i) first, the Senior Secured Creditor Liabilities (as defined below) pari passu and without any preference
between them;

**_New Debt Financing_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides, subject to certain conditions, for the implementation of existing,

will constitute, for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes
Liabilities, Cash Management Facility Liabilities, Hedging Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities, Topco Liabilities,
Super Senior Liabilities or Pari Passu Hedging Liabilities (each a “New Debt Financing”). The conditions
include certification by the EUR SSN Issuer that such New Debt Financing is not prohibited under the terms of
the Finance Documents.

Such financing arrangements may be implemented by way of refinancing, replacement, exchange, set-off,
discharge or increase of any such new, existing, additional, supplemental or new financing arrangement under the
relevant finance documents. In connection with and in order to facilitate any New Debt Financing, each agent in
respect of any Priority Secured Liabilities and the Security Agent (and each other person party to a Transaction
Security document or a Topco Independent Transaction Security document) is authorized and instructed to enter
promptly into any new security document, amend or waive any term of an existing security document and/or
release any asset from the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as the case may be)
and/or to effect the ranking, priority guarantees and Security of the New Debt Financing, subject to certain
conditions, including as regards the terms of such security (which shall be, unless otherwise required by the EUR

Topco Independent Transaction Security over equivalent assets).

191


-----

Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) in relation to an asset of or shares (or other ownership interests) in any such person
or which is otherwise acquired after the Closing Date (together an “Acquired Person or Asset”), any security,
guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of such New Debt Financing which is subsisting
at the date when the conditions to the incurrence of such New Debt Financing set out in the Intercreditor
Agreement have been satisfied (or is to be granted thereafter, including subject to any condition or periodic
testing) shall be permitted to subsist and there is no requirement to offer that security, guarantee, indemnity or
other assurance in respect of any other liabilities under any Debt Document. No security, guarantee, indemnity or
other assurance against loss is required to be given by any member of the Topco Group in respect of any
liabilities (including under any Debt Document) (i) over any Acquired Person or Asset if this would breach a
contractual undertaking applicable to the Topco Group or is excluded or exempt from being given under the
Agreed Security Principles (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement), (ii) over any asset required (including
subject to any condition) to provide credit support in relation to any Permitted Acquired Indebtedness (other than
as a result of any obligation to extend any Transaction Security ratably for the benefit of such Permitted Acquired
Indebtedness), or (iii) where the grant of such security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss is
prevented by the documentation relation to such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness or would give rise to an
obligation (including any payment obligation but not including any obligation to extend any Transaction Security
ratably for the benefit of such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness) under or in relation thereto.

**_Permitted Payments_**

_Permitted Payments in Respect of the Senior and Super Senior Debt_

Facilities Agreement, any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or Senior Secured Indenture or
Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or following certain insolvency events in relation to a
member of the Senior Secured Group, payments may only be made by Debtors or Third Party Security Providers
and received by creditors in accordance with the provisions described below under “—Application of Proceeds”
provided that after the Designation Date there shall be no obligation to turnover any such payments received,
other than those related to an enforcement of Transaction Security or a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) of
assets subject to the Transaction Security.

Any failure to make a payment in accordance with the Senior Secured Finance Documents following an
acceleration event as required by the ICA shall not prevent the occurrence of an event of default under such
applicable Senior Secured Finance Documents.

_Permitted Payments in Respect of the Second Lien Debt_

Prior to the first date on which all of the Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities and the Senior Secured
Notes Liabilities (together, the “Senior Secured Liabilities” and together with the Second Lien Liabilities and
Topco Liabilities being the “Secured Liabilities”) have been discharged (the “Senior Secured Discharge Date”),
the EUR SSN Issuer, the members of the Senior Secured Group and Third Party Security Providers may only
make specified scheduled payments in respect of the Second Lien Liabilities, in accordance with the finance
documents governing such Second Lien Liabilities, subject to compliance with certain conditions in the
Intercreditor Agreement.

The principal conditions are that the relevant payment (if it is a payment of principal or capitalized interest) is not
prohibited by any prior ranking financing agreement, including any Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement, Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement and any Senior Secured Notes Indenture (or if it is so
prohibited, that all necessary consents have been obtained to permit it), no payment stop notice has been issued to

Facility document or Senior Secured Notes document.

Certain specified payments in respect of Second Lien Liabilities are also permitted at all times, notwithstanding
that a payment stop notice is outstanding or such a payment default is continuing. These payments and basket
amounts are substantially similar to those referenced for Topco Liabilities in (ii) of the next paragraph.

_Topco Liabilities Payment Block Provisions_

A Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding from the date falling one (1) Business Day after
the date on which, following the occurrence of an event of default under any Senior Secured Liabilities (a
“Senior Secured Event of Default”) or an event of default under the Second Lien Liabilities (a “Second Lien
Event of Default”), the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the requisite Super Senior Creditors, Senior
Secured Creditors or Second Lien Creditors gave the instructions for the relevant stop notice to be delivered) (a
“Topco Payment Stop Notice”) to the agent under any Topco Facility (the “Topco Agent”) and the trustee under
any Topco Notes (the “Topco Notes Trustee”) advising that the Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien
Event of Default is continuing and suspending payments by the Senior Secured Group of the Topco Liabilities,
until the first to occur of:

(i) the date falling one hundred and seventy nine (179) days after delivery of that Topco Payment Stop Notice;

(ii) the date on which a default occurs for failure to pay principal at the original scheduled maturity of the
relevant Topco Liabilities;

(iii) if a Topco Standstill Period (as defined below) commences after delivery of that Topco Payment Stop
Notice, the date on which such standstill period expires;

(iv) the date on which the relevant Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien Event of Default has been
remedied or waived;

(v) the date on which the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of whichever of the Super Senior Creditors,
Senior Secured Creditors or Second Lien Creditors gave the instructions for the relevant stop notice to be

194


-----

delivered) delivers a notice to the Topco Borrower, the Topco Agent and the Topco Notes Trustee
cancelling the payment stop notice;

(vi) the Priority Discharge Date; and

(vii) the date on which the Topco Creditors take any enforcement action that is permitted under the Intercreditor
Agreement (see “—Permitted Topco Enforcement” below).

No Topco Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by the Security Agent in reliance on a Senior Secured Event of
Default or a Second Lien Event of Default more than forty five (45) days after the occurrence of the relevant
event of default. No more than one Topco Payment Stop Notice may be served (i) with respect to the same event
or set of circumstances, or (ii) in any period of three hundred and sixty (360) days.

Any failure to make a payment due in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities as a result of the issue of a Topco
Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default
shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an event of default as a consequence of that failure to make a payment in
relation to the relevant Topco Group Liabilities, or (ii) the issue of an enforcement notice in respect of an event
of default under the finance documents documenting any Topco Group Liabilities (a “Topco Enforcement
Notice”) on behalf of the Topco Creditors.

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

Nothing in the Second Lien or Topco payment block provisions will release any Debtor from the liability to
make any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue to accrue) under the applicable Debt
Documents even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time. The accrual and capitalization of
interest (if any) in accordance with the applicable Debt Documents shall continue notwithstanding the issue of a
payment stop notice.

**_Cure of Payment Stop_**

If:

(i) at any time following the issue of a Topco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured
Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default, that Topco Payment Stop Notice ceases to be
outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment
Default ceases to be continuing; and

(ii) the relevant Debtor or Topco Borrower then promptly pays to the Topco Creditors or any party that has
acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement as a creditor under a Topco Proceeds Loan (the “Topco Investors”)
(in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) an amount equal to any payments which had
accrued under the Topco Finance Documents or the Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (as applicable) and
which would have been Permitted Topco Payments but for that Topco Payment Stop Notice or Senior
Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default (as the case may be),

(A) then any event of default which may have occurred under a Topco Finance Document or Topco
Proceeds Loan Agreement and any Topco Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result
of that suspension of payments shall be deemed automatically waived without any further action being
required.

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, at any time prior to the latest to
occur of the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Second Lien Discharge Date
and the first date on which all of the Topco Liabilities have been fully discharged (the “Topco Discharge Date”)
(the “Final Discharge Date”) any creditor (other than a Senior Secured Creditor on or after the Designation Date)
receives or recovers from any Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider:

(i) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the creditors
under the Debt Documents other than any payment or distribution which is either (x) not prohibited under
the Intercreditor Agreement or (y) made in accordance with the provisions set out below under
“—Application of Proceeds”;

(ii) any amount by way of set-off which does not give effect to a payment permitted under the Intercreditor
Agreement;

(iii) any amount:

(A) on account of, or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the creditors under the Debt Documents
(I) after the occurrence of an acceleration event or the enforcement of any Transaction Security as a

195


-----

result of such an acceleration event, or (II) as a result of any other litigation or a Debtor, member of the
Senior Secured Group or any Third Party Security Provider (other than after the occurrence of an
Insolvency Event); or

(B) by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it after the occurrence of an acceleration
event or the enforcement of any Transaction Security as a result of such an acceleration event, other
than, in each case, any amount received or recovered in accordance with the provisions set out below
under “—Application of Proceeds”;

(iv) the proceeds of any enforcement of any of the Transaction Security except in accordance with the provisions
set out below under “—Application of Proceeds”; or

(v) any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities
owed by any Debtor, any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider which is
not in accordance with the provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds” and which is made
as a result of, or after, the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect of that Debtor, member of the Senior
Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider,

that creditor will:

(vi) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off (x) hold an amount of that
receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if less, the amount received or recovered) on trust for
(or otherwise on behalf and for the account of) the Security Agent and promptly pay or distribute that
amount to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement,
and (y) promptly pay or distribute an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which the receipt or recovery
exceeds the relevant liabilities to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement; and

(vii) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an amount equal
to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement.

A turnover mechanism on substantially the same terms applies in the event that, at any time on or after the
Designation Date but prior to the Final Discharge Date, any Senior Secured Creditor receives or recovers from
any Debtor, any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider (x) any proceeds from the
enforcement of security or from a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) or following an acceleration event or
the enforcement of security, any proceeds arising from any of the charged property or (y) any other amounts
which should otherwise be received or recovered by the Security Agent except in accordance with the provisions
set out below under “—Application of Proceeds.”

**_Effect of Insolvency Event_**

“Insolvency Event” is defined as, in relation to any Debtor, Material Subsidiary (each as defined in the Senior
Facilities Agreement) or Third Party Security Provider, (a) the passing of any resolution or making of an order
for insolvency, bankruptcy, winding up, dissolution, administration or reorganization (excluding solvent
reorganizations), (b) a moratorium is declared in relation to any of its indebtedness, (c) the appointment of a
liquidator, receiver, administrative receiver, administrator, compulsory manager or other similar officer in
respect of it or any of its assets, or (d) any analogous procedure or step is taken in any jurisdiction, other than (in
each case), frivolous or vexatious proceedings, proceedings or appointments which the Security Agent is satisfied
will be withdrawn or unsuccessful or as permitted under any Senior Secured Credit Facility Agreement or in any
Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or a
Second Lien Facility Agreement, or otherwise not constituting a default.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any party entitled to
receive a distribution out of the assets of a Debtor, Material Subsidiary or Third Party Security Provider (in the
case of a Senior Secured Creditor on or after the Designation Date, only to the extent such amounts constitute
proceeds of enforcement) shall direct the person responsible for the distribution to pay that distribution to the
Security Agent until the liabilities owing to the Secured Parties have been paid in full. The Security Agent shall
apply all such distributions paid to it in accordance with the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds”
below.

To the extent that any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider’s liabilities to
creditors are, with certain exceptions, discharged by way of set-off (mandatory or otherwise and in the case of a
Senior Secured Creditor on or after the Designation Date, only to the extent such amounts constitute proceeds of

196


-----

enforcement) after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any creditor benefiting from such set-off shall pay an
amount equal to the amount of the liabilities owed to it which are discharged by that set-off to the Security Agent
for application in accordance with the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” below.

If the Security Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in respect of
any liabilities, the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the extent that the
realization proceeds are actually applied towards such liabilities.

Subject to certain netting and set-off rights under ancillary or cash management facilities, each creditor
irrevocably authorizes the Security Agent to take Enforcement Action (as defined below), make demands, collect
and receive distributions, file claims and take other actions necessary to make recovery after the occurrence of an
Insolvency Event in relation to a Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider.
The creditors agree to do all things the Security Agent reasonably requests in order to give effect to these
provisions.

**_Security Enforcement Regime_**

_Enforcement of Security_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent may not take any action to enforce the Transaction
Security or the Topco Independent Transaction Security without the prior written consent of an Instructing
Group, Majority Second Lien Creditors or Majority Topco Creditors (as applicable) otherwise as specified in the
provisions described below.

An “Instructing Group” means:

(a) if the Designation Date has not occurred:

(i) prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors;

(ii) on or after the Senior Secured Discharge Date but before the Priority Discharge Date, the Majority
Second Lien Creditors; and

(iii) on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the Topco Discharge Date, the Majority Topco
Creditors; and

(b) at any time on or after the occurrence of the Designation Date and:

(i) prior to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the first date on which the Super Senior
Liabilities have been fully and finally discharged (the “Super Senior Discharge Date”), Senior Secured
Creditors (other than the Super Senior Creditors) representing more than fifty (50)% of the Senior
Secured Liabilities (other than the Super Senior Liabilities) (the “Majority Senior Secured Creditors”),
and Super Senior Creditors representing more than fifty (50)% of the Super Senior Secured Liabilities
(the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”) save that, for instructions relating to enforcement, it shall mean
the group of Secured Creditors entitled to give instructions in accordance with the enforcement regime
described under “—Enforcement of Transaction Security Prior to the Designation Date” and
“—Enforcement of Transaction Security on or After the Designation Date” below;

(ii) on or after the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date but
before the Priority Discharge Date, Second Lien Creditors representing more than fifty (50)% of the
Second Lien Liabilities (the “Majority Second Lien Creditors”); and

(iii) on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the Topco Discharge Date, Topco Creditors
representing more than fifty (50)% of the Topco Liabilities (the “Majority Topco Creditors”).

_Enforcement of Transaction Security Prior to the Designation Date_

Prior to the Designation Date, the Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security unless
instructed otherwise by (i) the Instructing Group, (ii) if, prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the
Instructing Group has (A) given no instructions or has instructed the Security Agent neither to enforce or cease
enforcing and (B) not required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal (as
defined below), an agent or trustee under the Second Lien Liabilities (acting on the instructions of the Majority
Second Lien Creditors) where the rights of the Second Lien Creditors to enforce have arisen under the
Intercreditor Agreement, or (iii) if, prior to the Priority Discharge Date, the Instructing Group (or Majority
Second Lien Creditors as applicable) have (A) given no instructions or have instructed the Security Agent neither
to enforce or cease enforcing and (B) not required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a
Distressed Disposal, a Topco Agent or the Topco Notes Trustee (acting on the instructions of the Majority Topco
Creditors).

197


-----

Subject to the Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms, the Instructing
Group or any other persons entitled to give instructions in accordance with the preceding paragraph may give or
refrain from giving instructions to the Security Agent to enforce, or refrain from enforcing, the Transaction
Security as they see fit. Notwithstanding the above paragraphs, if at any time the agents or representatives of the
Second Lien Creditors or Topco Creditors then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions to enforce the
Transaction Security do not give such instruction or do not indicate any intention to give such instruction, then
the Instructing Group may give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security as the
Instructing Group sees fit and the Security Agent shall act on such instructions received from the Instructing
Group.

Unless (i) the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an Insolvency Event or (ii) the
Instructing Group or any agent of the creditors represented in the Instructing Group determines in good faith that
to do so could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce
the Transaction Security or the realization proceeds of any such enforcement, before giving any such instructions
to enforce the Transaction Security or take any other enforcement action the creditors represented by an
Instructing Group will be required to consult with each other agent (provided that any agent in respect of Topco
Liabilities need only be consulted if such enforcement relates to Topco Shared Security) for a period of up to ten
Business Days or take any Enforcement Action (the “Consultation Period”) and the Instructing Group will only
be entitled to give the enforcement instructions described above or take any Enforcement Action after the expiry
of such Consultation Period.

_Enforcement of Transaction Security on or After the Designation Date_

On or after the Designation Date, the Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security unless
instructed otherwise in accordance with the provisions described in this paragraph. If the Transaction Security
has become enforceable, if either the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors
wish to issue enforcement instructions they shall deliver a copy of those instructions (an “Initial Enforcement
Notice”) to the Security Agent and to the other agents, trustees and hedge counterparties.

The Security Agent will act in accordance with any instructions (provided they are consistent with the
Enforcement Principles (as defined below)) received from (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, (ii) if the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to
instruct the Security Agent to pursue within three months of the Initial Enforcement Notice or the Super Senior
Discharge has not occurred within six months of the Initial Enforcement Notice, the Majority Super Senior
Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (iii) if an Insolvency Event (other than an
Insolvency Event directly caused by enforcement action taken at the request of a Super Senior Creditor) is
continuing, the Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (iv) if the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct
the Security Agent to pursue and the Majority Super Senior Creditors determine in good faith that a delay could
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce the
Transaction Security or on the realization of proceeds and the Majority Super Senior Creditors deliver
instructions before the Security Agent has received any instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors,
the Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (v) if, prior to the later
of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors (as applicable) have not given instructions or they have
instructed the Security Agent (A) not to enforce or cease enforcing or (B) required any Debtor or Third Party
Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, any agent or trustee in relation to the Second Lien Liabilities
(the “Second Lien Agent”) (acting on the instructions of the Majority Second Lien Creditors) where the rights of
the Second Lien Creditors to enforce have arisen under the Intercreditor Agreement, or (vi) if, prior to the
Priority Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the
Majority Second Lien Creditors (as applicable) have not given instructions or they have instructed the Security
Agent (A) not to enforce or cease enforcing or (B) required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make
a Distressed Disposal an agent or trustee under the Topco Finance Documents (acting on the instructions of the
Majority Topco Creditors). Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, if at any time the agents or representatives
of the Second Lien Creditors or Topco Creditors then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions do not give
such instruction and do not indicate any intention to give such instruction, then the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors or Majority Super Senior Creditors to the extent that such group is entitled to give enforcement
instructions as described in the paragraph above may give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the
Transaction Security as they see fit and the Security Agent shall act on such instructions.

198


-----

(i) “Enforcement Principles” means certain requirements as to the manner of enforcement, including that to the
extent consistent with a prompt and expeditious realization of value, the method of enforcement chosen
should maximize the value realized from such enforcement, (ii) certain proceeds must be received in cash,
and (iii) enforcement in relation to assets over €5,000,000 or shares if not carried out by way of a public
auction or other competitive sales process, shall (if the Security Agent is so requested by the Majority Super
Senior Creditors or Majority Senior Secured Creditors) benefit from a fairness opinion from an investment
bank, firm of accountants or third party financial adviser.

_Enforcement—Topco Independent Transaction Security_

Subject to the Topco Independent Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms,
an agent or trustee under the Topco Finance Documents (acting on the instructions of the Majority Topco
Creditors) may give or refrain giving, instructions to the Security Agent to enforce or refrain from enforcing the
Topco Independent Transaction Security as they see fit.

_Manner of Enforcement_

If the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is being enforced in accordance with any
of the above paragraphs, the Security Agent shall enforce the relevant Transaction Security or Topco
Independent Transaction Security in such manner (including the selection of any administrator of any Debtor or
Third Party Security Provider to be appointed by the Security Agent) as any persons entitled at any time under
the above provisions shall instruct it or, in the absence of any such instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit
(which may include taking no action).

No Secured Party shall have any independent power to enforce, or to have recourse to, any of the Transaction
Security or to exercise any right, power, authority or discretion arising under the Security Documents except
through the Security Agent.

_Security Held by Other Creditors_

If any Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is held by a creditor other than the
Security Agent, then creditors may only enforce that Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction
Security in accordance with instructions given by instructing creditors in accordance with the paragraphs above.

**_Enforcement Regime_**

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Second Lien Creditors_

Certain of the features set out below with respect to Topco Creditors may apply to the Second Lien Creditors,
with appropriate modifications for the relative position in the capital structure.

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Topco Creditors_

with no claims for damages and (G) the taking of any action by a member of the Topco Group not
prohibited by the Finance Documents.

_Permitted Topco Enforcement_

The restrictions set out above under “—Restrictions on Enforcement by Topco Creditors” will not apply in
respect of the Topco Group Liabilities, Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities, or any Transaction Security securing the
Topco Group Liabilities, if:

(i) an event of default under a Topco Finance Document or a Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (the “Relevant
Topco Default”) is continuing;

(ii) all agents or trustees in respect of the Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, and
Second Lien Liabilities have received a notice of the Relevant Topco Default specifying the event or

200


-----

circumstance in relation to the Relevant Topco Default from the Topco Agent, the Topco Notes Trustee or
the Topco Borrower;

(iii) a Topco Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and

(iv) the Relevant Topco Default is continuing at the end of that Topco Standstill Period.

Promptly upon becoming aware of an event of default under a Topco Finance Document, a Topco Notes Trustee,
Topco Agent or Topco Investor (as the case may be) may give a Topco Enforcement Notice notifying any agent
under a Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement (the “Senior Agent”), Senior Secured Notes Trustee, the
Second Lien Agent and any second lien notes trustee of the existence of such event of default.

“Topco Standstill Period” means the period beginning on the date (the “Topco Standstill Start Date”) a Topco
Enforcement Notice is served in respect of such a Relevant Topco Default and ending on the earliest to occur of:

(i) the date falling one hundred and seventy nine (179) days after the Topco Standstill Start Date (the “Topco
Standstill Period”);

(ii) the date the Priority Secured Parties take any Enforcement Action in relation to a particular Debtor or Third
Party Security Provider, provided that:

(A) if a Topco Standstill Period ends pursuant to this paragraph (ii), the Topco Creditors or a Topco
Investor (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) may only take the same Enforcement
Action in relation to a Topco Guarantor as the Enforcement Action taken by the Priority Secured
Parties against such Topco Guarantor and not against any other member of the Senior Secured Group
or Third Party Security Provider; and

(B) Enforcement Action for the purpose of this paragraph shall not include action taken to preserve or
protect any security as opposed to realize it;

(iii) the date of an Insolvency Event (as defined above) in relation to a particular Topco Guarantor against whom
Enforcement Action is to be taken;

(iv) the expiry of any other Topco Standstill Period outstanding at the date such first mentioned Topco Standstill

Majority Second Lien Creditors (as applicable) have given their consent to the relevant Enforcement Action.

The Topco Creditors or Topco Investor (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) may take
Enforcement Action under the provisions described in this section (Permitted Topco Enforcement) in relation to
a Relevant Topco Default even if, at the end of any relevant Topco Standstill Period or at any later time, a further
Topco Standstill Period has begun as a result of any other event of default in respect of the Topco Liabilities.

_Option to Purchase: Topco Creditors_

Following acceleration or the enforcement of Transaction Security upon acceleration under any Senior Secured
Creditor Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities, Topco Creditors may, by giving not less than
10 days’ prior written notice to the Security Agent, elect to purchase all, but not part of, the Senior Lender
Liabilities, Super Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Cash Management Facility Liabilities,
Second Lien Lender Liabilities and Second Lien Notes Liabilities for the amount that would have been required to
prepay or redeem such liabilities on such date plus certain costs and expenses. Topco Creditors must also elect for
the counterparties to hedging obligations to transfer their hedging obligations to holders in exchange (subject to
specified conditions) for the amount that would have been payable under such hedging obligations had they been
terminated on such date plus certain costs and expenses in connection with any such purchase.

**_Non-Distressed Disposals_**

The Security Agent (on behalf of itself and the other Secured Parties) and each other person party to a
Transaction Security document or a Topco Independent Transaction Security document agrees that it shall (and is
irrevocably authorized, instructed and obliged to do so without further consent, agreement, instruction, direction,
confirmation, payment, certification or other document, request or information from any creditor, other Secured
Party or Debtor) promptly following receipt of a written request from the EUR SSN Issuer to the Security Agent:

(i) release (or procure the release) from the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security
and the Secured Debt Documents:

(A) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any asset which the EUR SSN
Issuer has confirmed is the subject of:

201


-----

(1) a disposal not prohibited under the Finance Documents or where any applicable release and/ or
consent has been obtained under the applicable Finance Document including a disposal to a
member of the Senior Secured Group but without prejudice to any obligation of any member of
the Senior Secured Group in a Finance Document to provide replacement security; or

(2) any other transaction not prohibited by the Finance Documents or where any applicable release
and/or consent has been obtained under the applicable Finance Document pursuant to which that
asset will cease to be held or owned by a member of the Senior Secured Group; and

in each case where such disposal is not a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) (in each case, a
“Non-Distressed Disposal”);

(B) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any document or other agreement
requested in order for any member of the Senior Secured Group to the extent that the EUR SSN Issuer
has confirmed that such action is not prohibited by any Finance Document to effect any amendment or
waiver or otherwise exercise any rights, comply with any obligations or take any action in relation to
such document or agreement;

(C) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any asset of any member of the
Senior Secured Group which has ceased or will cease to be a Debtor or guarantor simultaneously with
such release to the extent that the EUR SSN Issuer has confirmed that such ceasing to be a Debtor or
guarantor in accordance with the terms of each Finance Document or the Agreed Security Principles
(as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement); and

(D) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any other asset to the extent that the
EUR SSN Issuer has confirmed that such security is not required to be given or such release is
otherwise, in accordance with the terms of any Finance Document or the Agreed Security Principles (as
defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement);

(ii) in the case of a disposal of share or ownership interests in a Debtor, other member of the Senior Secured
Group or any holding company of any Debtor or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor, other
member of the Senior Secured Group or any holding company of any Debtor will cease to be a member of
the Topco Group or a Debtor, release or procure the release of that Debtor or other member of the Senior
Secured Group and its subsidiaries from all present and future liabilities under the Secured Debt Documents
and the respective assets of such Debtor and its subsidiaries from the Transaction Security or Topco
Independent Transaction Security and the Secured Debt Documents (including any claim relating to a Debt
Document); and

(iii) effect a Debt Transfer (as defined below).

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraphs (i)(A), (i)(B) and (ii) above, the EUR SSN Issuer
shall confirm in writing to the Security Agent, that the relevant disposal or other action is not prohibited as at the
date of completion of such release or, at the option of the EUR SSN Issuer, on the date that the definitive
agreement for such disposal or similar transaction is entered into.

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraph (i)(C) or (i)(D) above, the EUR SSN Issuer shall
confirm in writing to the Security Agent, that such security is not required to be given or the relevant release or
cessation is otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Finance Documents or the Agreed Security Principles
(as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement).

In the case of a disposal of shares or other ownership interests in a Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group
or holding company of any Debtor or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor, member of the Senior
Secured Group or holding company of any Debtor will cease to be a member of Topco Group or a Debtor, to the
extent the EUR SSN Issuer has confirmed to the Security Agent that such disposal or other transaction or
designation is not prohibited by the Finance Documents, if such member of the Topco Group or a Debtor is a
borrower, issuer or primary debtor under any Debt Document, such person shall have the right to voluntarily
prepay all liabilities outstanding under any Debt Document to the applicable creditors concurrently with ceasing
to be a member of the Topco Group or Debtor; and any right to decline, delay or prevent any prepayment in any
Debt Document shall be disapplied to the extent that if exercised such right would prevent the repayment of all
such liabilities in full by such person (but without prejudice to any prepayment fees, make-whole payment, break
costs or other payment required by the relevant Finance Documents).

The EUR SSN Issuer may at any time require that all of the rights and obligations of any borrower of Super
Senior Liabilities, Senior Lender Liabilities, Cash Management Facility Liabilities or Second Lien Lender

202


-----

Liabilities (each, a “Borrower”) under the applicable Secured Debt Documents be novated or otherwise
transferred by that Borrower (a “Debt Transfer”) provided that (i) either (A) such Debt Transfer is to another
member of the Group; (b) such Debt Transfer is by a Borrower where (I) that Borrower or any holding company
of that Borrower is being disposed of in accordance with the Finance Documents, and (II) the proceeds of such
disposal are not otherwise required to be applied unconditionally in prepayment of that Borrower’s liabilities
under the applicable Finance Documents; or (C) such Debt Transfer is undertaken in connection with an IPO, and
(ii) the transferee in respect of such Debt Transfer is another borrower under the Super Senior Liabilities, Senior
Lender Liabilities, Cash Management Facility Liabilities or Second Lien lender Liabilities (as applicable). Any
Debt Transfer may (and shall upon the request of the EUR SSN Issuer) be effected on a cashless basis, by way of
book entries and not as physical cash movement to repay and reborrow any applicable liabilities.

**_Distressed Disposals_**

“Distressed Disposal” means a disposal of an asset or shares of, or other financial securities issued by a member
of the Senior Secured Group or, in the case of a Third Party Security Provider, any assets or shares or financial
securities which are subject to the Transaction Security which is being effected (a) at the request of an Instructing

If a Distressed Disposal of any asset is being effected, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (subject to
acting in accordance with certain conditions set out below) at the cost of the relevant Debtor, Third Party
Security Provider and the EUR SSN Issuer and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation
from any creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement, Third Party Security Provider or Debtor:

creditors or other Debtors:

(A) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does not intend that any
transferee of those liabilities (the “Transferee”) will be treated as a Secured Creditor or a Secured Party
for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement) to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to
dispose of all or part of those liabilities, provided that, notwithstanding any other provision of any Debt
Document, the Transferee shall not be treated as a Secured Creditor or Secured Party for the purposes

Agreement) to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all (and not part only) of
the liabilities owed to the Secured Creditors and all or part of any other liabilities,

on behalf of, in each case, the relevant creditors, Third Party Security Providers and Debtors;

(i) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding
company of a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with
the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the “Receiving Entity”) all or
any part of the Disposed Entity’s obligations or any obligations of a subsidiary of that Disposed
Entity in respect of the intra-group liabilities or liabilities owed to any Debtor, to execute and
deliver or enter into any agreement to:

(A) transfer all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or liabilities to any
Debtor on behalf of the relevant intra-group lenders and Debtors to which those obligations are owed

Guarantor of the Senior Secured Liabilities) to accept the transfer of all or part of the obligations in
respect of those intra-group liabilities, liabilities owed to Debtors on behalf of the Receiving Entity or
Receiving Entities to which the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or liabilities owed
to Debtors are to be transferred.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities as described
above) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out under
“—Application of Proceeds” below as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the Transaction
Security and, to the extent that any disposal of liabilities has occurred, as if that disposal of liabilities had not
occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities) effected by, or at the request of, the Security
Agent, the Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing market
conditions (although the Security Agent shall not have any obligation to postpone any such Distressed Disposal
or disposal of liabilities in order to achieve a higher price).

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Second Lien Creditors are entitled to give
and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is not authorized
to release any Debtor, Subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities or any
other liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities or
any other liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any
contingent liability relating to a bank guarantee, letter of credit, cash management facility or an ancillary facility,
made the subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant senior creditor) immediately
following that release.

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Topco Creditors are entitled to give, and
have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is not authorized to
release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities or any
other liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor or any Second Lien Creditor unless those borrowing
liabilities, guarantee liabilities or any other liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien
Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent liability relating to a bank guarantee,
letter of credit, cash management facility or an ancillary facility, made the subject of cash collateral arrangements
acceptable to the relevant senior creditor) immediately following that release.

Where borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities would otherwise be released pursuant to the provisions described
above, the creditor concerned may elect to have those borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities transferred to a
holding company of the EUR SSN Issuer specified by such creditor, in which case the Security Agent is
irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the EUR SSN Issuer and without any consent,
sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor or Debtor) to execute such documents as are
required to so transfer those borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities.

Subject to the provisions described below, if a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities pursuant to
paragraphs (iv) and (v) above) is being effected by or at the request of the Security Agent, unless the consent of
each Senior Agent and each Senior Secured Notes Trustee (as applicable) has been obtained, it is a further
condition to any release, transfer or disposal that:

(i) the consideration for such sale or disposal is in cash (or substantially all in cash); and

204


-----

(ii) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made (A) pursuant to a public auction
or other competitive sale process conducted with the advice of a reputable, independent and internationally
recognized investment bank or firm of accountants or (if all such banks or firms are conflicted), a reputable,
independent and internationally recognized third party professional firm which is regularly engaged in
providing valuations of businesses or assets similar or comparable to those subject to the relevant
Transaction Security) and, in each case, not being an auditor or administrator or other relevant officer of the
applicable company (a “Financial Advisor”) as selected by the Security Agent (it being acknowledged that
the Security Agent has no obligation to select or engage any Financial Advisor until it has been indemnified
and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction), in respect of which the Secured Creditors are entitled to
participate (a “Competitive Sales Process”); or (B) where a Financial Adviser selected by the Security Agent
has delivered an opinion (including an enterprise valuation of the Group which can be relied upon by the
Security Agent and disclosed to the Senior Secured Creditors, the Second Lien Creditors and the Topco
Creditors on a non-reliance basis) that the proceeds received or recovered in connection with such sale or
disposal are fair from a financial point of view taking into account all relevant circumstances including the
method of enforcement (it being acknowledged that the Security Agent has no obligation to select or engage
any Financial Adviser unless it has been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

If before the Second Lien Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities pursuant to
paragraphs (iv) and (v) above) is being effected such that any Second Lien Liabilities and/or Transaction Security
securing Second Lien Liabilities will be released, transferred or disposed of pursuant to the Intercreditor
Agreement, it is a further condition to any release, transfer or disposal that either:

(i) each agent and trustee in respect of any Second Lien Liabilities has approved the release, transfer or
disposal; or

(ii) where shares or assets of a borrower, issuer or guarantor in respect of Second Lien Liabilities are sold:

(A) the consideration for such sale or disposal is in cash (or substantially all in cash); and

(B) at the time of completion of the sale or disposal the borrowing, guarantee and (to the extent permitted
by the Intercreditor Agreement) other liabilities owing to each of the Secured Creditors and Unsecured
Creditors by the Debtors and their respective subsidiaries being sold or disposed of (a “Relevant
Claim”) are (to the same extent) unconditionally released and discharged or sold or disposed of
concurrently with such sale (and not assumed by the purchaser or its affiliates), and all security under
documents creating security in respect of the Secured Obligations in respect of the assets of such
members of the Senior Secured Group is simultaneously and unconditionally released and discharged
concurrently with such sale, provided that, if each Senior Agent and Senior Secured Notes Trustee
(acting reasonably and in good faith) determines that the Senior Secured Creditors will recover a
greater cash amount if such Relevant Claim is sold or otherwise transferred to the purchaser or its
affiliates and not released or discharged and provided such amount is nevertheless less than the
aggregate amount of outstanding Senior Secured Liabilities, which shall be deemed to be the case if
there are no bidders) or if each Senior Agent and Senior Secured Notes Trustee (acting reasonably and
in good faith) determines that there are no bona fide and fully committed bids in cash or substantially
all in cash in excess of the outstanding amount of Senior Secured Liabilities and serves a written notice
on the Security Agent confirming the same, then the Security Agent shall be entitled immediately to
sell and transfer such Relevant Claim to the purchaser or its affiliate; and

(C) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made pursuant to a Competitive
Sales Process or where a Financial Adviser selected by the Security Agent has delivered an opinion

non-reliance basis) that the proceeds received or recovered in connection with such sale or disposal are

of enforcement (it being acknowledged that the Security Agent has no obligation to select or engage
any Financial Adviser unless it has been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its
satisfaction).

If before the Topco Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities pursuant to paragraphs and
(v) above) is being effected such that any Topco Liabilities or Transaction Security securing Topco Liabilities
will be released, transferred or disposed of pursuant to the provisions described above, it is a further condition to
any release, transfer or disposal that either:

(i) each agent and trustee in respect of any Topco Liabilities has approved the release, transfer or disposal; or

205


-----

(B) at the time of completion of the sale or disposal the borrowing, guarantee and (to the extent permitted
by the Intercreditor Agreement) other liabilities owing to each of the Secured Creditors and Unsecured
Creditors by the Debtors and their respective subsidiaries being sold or disposed of (a “Relevant
Claim”) are (to the same extent) unconditionally released and discharged or sold or disposed of
concurrently with such sale (and not assumed by the purchaser or its affiliates), and all security under
documents creating security in respect of the Secured Obligations in respect of the assets of such
members of the Senior Secured Group is simultaneously and unconditionally released and discharged
concurrently with such sale, provided that, if each Senior Agent, Senior Secured Notes Trustee and
each agent and trustee in respect of any Second Lien Liabilities (acting reasonably and in good faith)
determines that the Priority Secured Parties will recover a greater cash amount if such Relevant Claim
is sold or otherwise transferred to the purchaser or its affiliates and not released or discharged and
provided such amount is nevertheless less than the aggregate amount of outstanding Priority Secured
Liabilities, which shall be deemed to be the case if there are no bidders or if each Senior Agent, Senior
Secured Notes Trustee and each agent and trustee in respect of any Second Lien Liabilities (acting
reasonably and in good faith) determines that there are no bona fide and fully committed bids in cash or
substantially all in cash in excess of the outstanding amount of the Priority Secured Liabilities and
serves a written notice on the Security Agent confirming the same, then the Security Agent shall be
entitled immediately to sell and transfer such Relevant Claim to the purchaser or its affiliate; and

(C) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made pursuant to a Competitive
Sales Process or where a Financial Adviser selected by the Security Agent has delivered an opinion
(including an enterprise valuation of the Group which can be relied upon by the Security Agent and
disclosed to the Senior Secured Creditors, the Second Lien Creditors and the Topco Creditors on a
non-reliance basis) that the proceeds received or recovered in connection with such sale or disposal are
fair from a financial point of view taking into account all relevant circumstances including the method of
enforcement (it being acknowledged that the Security Agent has no obligation to select or engage any
Financial Adviser unless it has been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

When acting for the purposes of the above paragraphs, the Security Agent shall always act (i) if the relevant
Distressed Disposal is being effected by way of enforcement of the Transaction Security in accordance with the
provisions set out under “—Manner of Enforcement” above, and (ii) in any other case on the instructions of the
Instructing Group or, in the absence of such instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit (which may include
taking no action).

(ii) the balance, if any, in payment to the relevant Debtor.

**Equitably Subordinated Creditors**

Notwithstanding the provisions described above under “Order of Application—Transaction Security” and “Order
_of Application—Topco Independent Transaction Security”, to the extent that the Recoveries held by the Security_
Agent are insufficient to discharge the liabilities owed to all creditors in any class of creditors and this is due to
any creditor (“Equitably Subordinated Creditor”) whose commitments, any other participation rights (including
by way of sub-participation) and/or any other rights and claims under the Debt Documents against a Debtor
incorporated in Germany which, prior to or in an insolvency of the Debtor, would be subordinated or could be
subject to potential avoidance claims pursuant to certain provisions under the German Insolvency Code or the
German Avoidance Act (“Equitably Subordinated Liabilities”) being part of that class of creditors, the amount to
be applied by the Security Agent in discharge of the liabilities of that class of creditors shall be distributed to the
other creditors of that class and the Equitably Subordinated Creditor will not be entitled to receive any part of
that amount.

An Equitably Subordinated Creditor will not have the benefit (but will still be subject to the obligations under
any sharing provisions in the Debt Documents) and will not be entitled to receive any payment and neither the
Security Agent nor the agent shall be required to make any payment under or in connection with the Debt
Documents in respect of any Equitably Subordinated Liabilities.

To the extent that any Equitably Subordinated Liabilities would result in the subordination of liabilities towards
any other creditors under any Debt Document or prejudice the validity or enforceability of any Transaction
Security or guarantee and/or indemnity provided to any creditor under the Debt Documents in any way, the
relevant Equitably Subordinated Creditor will be deemed not to be a Secured Party under any document creating
Transaction Security and will not benefit from the guarantee or indemnity.

**Equalization**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, for any reason, any liabilities relating to Super Senior
Liabilities, Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities remain unpaid after the first
date on which certain types of Enforcement Action are taken (the “Enforcement Date”) and the resulting losses
are not borne by the creditors in any given specified class in the proportions which their respective exposures at
the Enforcement Date bore to the aggregate exposures of all the creditors in that specified class at the
Enforcement Date, the relevant class of creditors will make such payments amongst themselves as the Security
Agent shall require to put the relevant creditors in such a position that (after taking into account such payments)
those losses are borne in those proportions.

208

**Required Consents**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, subject to certain exceptions, its terms may be amended or waived
only with the consent of the EUR SSN Issuer, the agents and trustees for the Secured Parties, and the Security
Agent, provided that, to the extent that an amendment, waiver or consent only affects one class of creditors, and
such amendment, waiver or consent could not reasonably be expected materially or adversely to affect the
interests of the other classes of creditors, only written agreement from the relevant agent or trustee acting on
behalf of the affected class (or in the case of hedging counterparties, each affected hedge counterparty) shall be
required.

An amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Agreement that has the effect of changing or which relates to,
among other matters, the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” above and the order of priority or
subordination under the Intercreditor Agreement shall not be made without the consent of

(i) each of the agents or trustees (acting in accordance with the relevant finance documents) under the Senior
Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities,

(ii) each Cash Management Facility Lender (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would
materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of such Cash Management Facility Lender under the
Intercreditor Agreement and would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other
creditor or class of creditors other than the Cash Management Facility Lenders (solely in their capacity as
such)),

(iii) each hedge counterparty (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would materially
adversely affect the rights and obligations of such hedge counterparty under the Intercreditor Agreement and
would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other creditor or class of creditors

(iv) the EUR SSN Issuer.

Each agent or trustee shall, to the extent instructed to consent by the requisite percentage of creditors it represents
or as otherwise authorized by the Debt Documents to which it is party, act on such instructions or authorizations
in accordance therewith (save to the extent any amendments so consented or authorized to relate to any provision
affecting the personal rights and obligations of that agent or trustee in its capacity as such).

**_Amendments and Waivers: Transaction Security Documents_**

Subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement (as described below), the Security Agent
(a) may, if the EUR SSN Issuer consents, amend the terms of, release or waive any of the requirements of or
grant consents under, any document creating Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security
which shall be binding on each party, and (b) may if the EUR SSN Issuer consents, and shall promptly upon
request of the EUR SSN Issuer, amend, release and/or retake any document creating Transaction Security where
such amendment, release and/or retake is required in order to ensure the validity, perfection or priority of the
relevant Transaction Security, together with any related or consequential waiver (including by reason of a failure
to register any relevant document with Companies House within the prescribed time limit set out in section 859
of the Companies Act 2006, in which case the Security Agent shall also irrevocably waive any payment or other
obligation or default arising out of such failure to register) and any such amendment, release, waiver and retake
shall be binding on each Party.

Where any such amendment, release or waiver of, or consent under, any document creating Transaction Security
or Topco Independent Transaction Security would adversely affect the nature or scope of the assets subject to
Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as the case may be) or the manner in which the
proceeds of enforcement of the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security are distributed,
such amendment may not be made without the prior consent of:

(i) each of the agents or trustees other than an agent under any Cash Management Facility, if appointed (acting
in accordance with the relevant finance documents) under the Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities,
the Second Lien Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities,

(ii) each Cash Management Facility Lender or the agent for the relevant Cash Management Facility on its behalf
but only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would materially adversely affect the rights
and obligations of such Cash Management Facility Lender under the Intercreditor Agreement in their
capacity as such and would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other creditor or
class of creditors,

209


-----

(iii) each hedge counterparty (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would materially
adversely affect the rights and obligations of such hedge counterparty under the under the Intercreditor
Agreement and would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other creditor or class
of creditors other than the hedge counterparties (solely in their capacity as such)), and

(i) the EUR SSN Issuer.

**_Exceptions_**

Subject to the paragraph below, an amendment, waiver or consent which relates to the rights or obligations which
are personal to an agent, an arranger or the Security Agent in its capacity as such (including any ability of that
Security Agent to act in its discretion under the Intercreditor Agreement) may not be effected without the consent
of that agent, arranger or, as the case may be, Security Agent.

The preceding paragraph and the first paragraph above under “—Amendments and Waivers: Transaction Security
_Documents” are subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement, relating in particular to_

(i) any release of Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security, claims or liabilities, or
(ii) to any amendment waiver or consent, which, in each case, the Security Agent gives in accordance with
the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement relating to the incurrence of additional or refinancing debt or
the provisions set out under “—New Debt Financings,” “—Non-Distressed Disposals” and “—Distressed
_Disposals” above. Any release, amendment, waiver or consent effected in accordance with the relevant_
provisions of the Debt Documents relating to such matters can be effected solely by the EUR SSN Issuer
and the Security Agent.

**_Snooze/Lose_**

If in relation to:

(i) a request for a consent in relation to any of the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (or any other Debt
Document other than a notes indenture which does not contain a similar snooze/lose provision or which
applies a longer period than that specified in the Intercreditor Agreement);

(ii) a request to participate in any vote of a class of creditors under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (or
any other Debt Document other than a notes indenture which does not contain a similar snooze/lose
provision or which applies a longer period than that specified in the Intercreditor Agreement);

(iii) a request to approve any other action under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (or any other Debt
Document other than a notes indenture which does not contain a similar snooze/lose provision or which
applies a longer period than that specified in the Intercreditor Agreement); or

(iv) a request to provide any confirmation or notification under the Intercreditor Agreement (or any other Debt
Document other than a notes indenture which does not contain a similar snooze/lose provision or which
applies a longer period than that specified in the Intercreditor Agreement),

then, in each case, any creditor:

(A) fails to respond to that request within ten (10) Business Days (or any other period of time notified by the
Company, with the prior agreement of the Agents if the period for this provision to operate is less than ten
(10) Business Days) of that request being made; or

(B) fails to provide details of its participation within the timescale specified by the Security Agent:

1. in the case of paragraphs (i) to (iii) above, that the creditor’s participation (as the case may be) shall be
deemed to be zero for the purpose of calculating their participation in respect of the matter when
ascertaining whether any relevant percentage (including, for the avoidance of doubt, unamity) of their
participation or has been obtained to give that consent, carry that vote or approve that action;

2. in the case of paragraphs (i) to (iii) above, that the creditor’s status shall be disregarded for the
purposes of ascertaining whether the agreement of any specified group of creditors has been obtained
to give that consent, carry that vote or approve that action; and

3. in the case of paragraph (iv) above, that confirmation or notification shall be deemed to have been
given,

provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, this Snooze/Loose clause shall not apply to any Noteholder in
respect of any request where such Noteholder is not given the option to respond to such request in the negative
but shall otherwise apply to all Noteholders.

On or following an initial public offering of a member of the Senior Secured Group (or a holding company
thereof) (an “IPO Event”) (or in contemplation of an IPO Event with respect to the release of Transaction
Security if required to implement such IPO Event), the EUR SSN Issuer is entitled to give notice to each agent
and each Hedge Counterparty (a “Pushdown Notice”) that the terms of the Debt Documents will automatically
operate (with effect from the date specified in the relevant Pushdown Notice (the “IPO Pushdown Date”)) so that,
amongst other things, (i) the Senior Secured Group (and all related provisions) will now refer to the member of
the Senior Secured Group or holding company of the EUR SSN Issuer who will issue shares or whose shares are
to be sold pursuant to such IPO (the “IPO Pushdown Entity,” and if any Topco Notes are not refinanced in full on
or before the IPO Pushdown Date, the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be any holding company of the EUR SSN
Issuer which is the issuer or borrower of any Topco Liabilities) and its Restricted Subsidiaries, (ii) all financial
ratio calculations shall be made excluding any holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity and all reporting
obligations shall be assumed at the level of the IPO Pushdown Entity, (iii) each reference in the Debt Documents
to the EUR SSN Issuer or any holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be deemed to be a reference to
the IPO Pushdown Entity (to the extent applicable and unless the context requires otherwise) (iv) certain
provisions of the Debt Documents (including representations, undertakings and events of default), will cease to
apply to any holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity, (v) no event, matter or circumstance relating to any
holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall directly or indirectly result in a breach of any representation,
warranty, undertaking of event of default, (vi) each holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be
irrevocably and unconditionally released from all obligations and restrictions under the Debt Documents
(including any Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security) and (viii) unless otherwise
notified by the EUR SSN Issuer, each Subordinated Creditor, Third Party Security Provider, Investor (as defined
in the Senior Facilities Agreement) or Topco Independent Obligor will be irrevocably and unconditionally
released from its obligations and restrictions under the Intercreditor Agreement in the appropriate capacity.

Subject to the consent of the majority lenders under and as defined in the Senior Lender Liabilities, noteholders
representing more than 50% of any Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the majority lenders under and as defined in
any Second Lien Facility Agreement, noteholders representing more than 50% of any Second Lien Notes
Liabilities, the majority lenders under and as defined in any Topco Facility and noteholders representing more
than 50% of any Topco Notes Liabilities (following the relevant IPO), each subsidiary of the IPO Pushdown
Entity shall also be released from all obligations as Debtor and guarantor under the Debt Documents and from
the Transaction Security (other than, in each case, borrowing liabilities). Each party to the Intercreditor
Agreement shall be required to enter into any amendment, release or replacement of any Debt Document required
to facilitate such matters.

**_Agreement to Override_**

Unless expressly stated otherwise therein, the Intercreditor Agreement overrides anything in any other Debt
Documents to the contrary (other than any documents creating Transaction Security which are governed by
German law and which need to be notarized (beurkundet)).

**Private Senior Notes**

Prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, in connection with the Transactions, the SUN Issuer is expected to issue
€650 million (equivalent) aggregate principal amount of Senior Floating Rate Notes due 2028, consisting of a
U.S. dollar tranche and a euro tranche (the “Private Senior Notes”), to certain third party investors. The Private
Senior Notes will be governed by the Private Senior Notes Indenture. The Private Senior Notes will mature on
, 2028.

The Private Senior Notes will (i) rank pari passu in right of payment with the existing and future senior
indebtedness of the SUN Issuer, (ii) rank senior in right of payment to all of the SUN Issuer’s existing and future
indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Private Senior Notes, (iii) be effectively
subordinated to all of the SUN Issuer’s existing and future indebtedness that is secured by liens that do not secure
the Private Senior Notes, to the extent of the value of such property and assets securing such indebtedness and
(iv) be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness of the subsidiaries of the SUN Issuer that
do not guarantee the Private Senior Notes, including their obligations to trade creditors.

The Private Senior Notes will initially be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by the EUR SSN Issuer,
Newco, Bidco and the USD SSN Issuer. Subject to certain agreed security principles, certain material
subsidiaries of the SUN Issuer will subsequently guarantee the Private Senior Notes not later than on the earlier

211


-----

of (a) the date on which such guarantor provides a guarantee of the Senior Facilities and (b) 150 days from the
Acquisition Closing Date and, in each case, substantially simultaneously with the obligations under the Senior
Facilities.

The Private Senior Notes and the guarantees thereof will be, pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, secured by the SUN Collateral, comprising (1) on a first-priority basis, (i) a share pledge in respect
of Vertical Topco III’s shares in the capital of the SUN Issuer pursuant to a German law governed share pledge
agreement, (ii) a pledge in respect of all the material bank accounts of the SUN Issuer pursuant to a German law
governed bank account pledge agreement, and (iii) a pledge in respect of any intercompany receivables owed to
Vertical Topco III by the SUN Issuer relating to any proceeds loan or other shareholder loan pursuant to a
German law governed receivables pledge agreement; and (2) on a second-priority basis, security interests over
the Shared Collateral. See “—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The Private Senior Notes are subject to special mandatory redemption provisions. In the event that the
Acquisition has not been consummated on or prior to the date that is three business days from the date the Private
Senior Notes are issued, the SUN Issuer will redeem the entire outstanding aggregate principal amount of the
Private Senior Notes at a price equal to 100.000% of the initial issue price of the Private Senior Notes, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, from the date the Private Senior Notes are issued to
(but not including) the special mandatory redemption date (subject to the right of noteholders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date). The conditions applicable to
the special mandatory redemption may be waived by noteholders representing at least a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Private Senior Notes then outstanding.

At any time prior to the date that is the second anniversary of the date on which the Private Senior Notes are
issued (the “First Call Date”), the SUN Issuer may, at its option, redeem all or part of the Private Unsecured
Notes at a redemption price equal to 100.000% of the principal amount of the Private Senior Notes so redeemed
plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, plus a
“make whole” redemption premium. Additionally, at any time prior to the First Call Date, the SUN Issuer may,
at its option, redeem during each calendar year up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Private Senior
Notes at a redemption price equal to 103.000% of the principal amount of the Private Senior Notes so redeemed
plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

At any time and from time to time on or after the First Call Date, the SUN Issuer may, at its option, redeem all or
part of the Private Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to the percentage of principal amount of the Private
Senior Notes so redeemed set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to,
but excluding, the redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on of the
year indicated below:

**Year** **Redemption Price**

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . %

At any time and from time to time, the SUN Issuer may, at its option, redeem all or part of the Private Senior
Notes at a redemption price equal to 101.500% of the principal amount of the Private Senior Notes so redeemed,
plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, with the
proceeds from a permitted specified asset disposition, pursuant to the terms of the Private Senior Notes
Indenture.

If a change of control under the Private Senior Notes Indenture occurs, unless (i) a third party makes a change of
control offer as described in the Private Senior Notes Indenture or (ii) the SUN Issuer has previously or
substantially concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Private
Senior Notes, the SUN Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Private Unsecured Notes at a price in cash
equal to (i) if the change of control occurs prior to the First Call Date, 100.000% of the principal amount of such
Private Senior Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the
redemption date, plus a “make whole” redemption premium or (ii) if the change of control occurs on or after the
First Call Date, the applicable redemption price set forth in the table above.

In connection with any tender offer for the Private Senior Notes, if noteholders of not less than 90% in aggregate
principal amount of the applicable series of Private Senior Notes then outstanding, validly tender and do not
withdraw such Private Senior Notes in such tender offer and the SUN Issuer, or any third party making such a
tender offer in lieu of the SUN Issuer, purchases, all of the Private Senior Notes in such series validly tendered
and not withdrawn by such noteholders, the SUN Issuer or such third party will have the right to redeem the

212


-----

principal amount of the applicable series of Private Senior Notes then outstanding in whole, but not in part
following such purchase at a price equal to the price (excluding any early tender or incentive fee) offered to such
other noteholders in such tender offer, plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and
unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, such redemption date.

The Private Senior Notes Indenture provides for certain covenants, including in respect of payments, reporting,
guarantees and limitations of restrictions on distributions from restricted subsidiaries.

The Private Senior Notes Indenture will be governed by the laws of the State of New York.

**PIK Notes**

In connection with the Transactions, on or prior to the Acquisition Completion Date, Vertical Topco II, an
indirect holding company of the Issuers, is expected to issue €2,000 (equivalent) aggregate principal amount of
Senior PIK Notes due 2030. The PIK Notes will mature in 2030, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased and
cancelled in accordance with the indenture governing the PIK Notes. Interest on the PIK Notes will be payable
by increasing the principal amount of the outstanding Notes in a principal amount equal to such interest, except
for the last interest payment at maturity, which will be made entirely in cash. As of the issue date of the PIK
Notes, (i) the PIK Notes will not be guaranteed and will be secured by first-ranking security interests over the
shares of Vertical Topco III, structural intercompany loans owed by Vertical Topco III (if any) and Vertical
Topco II’s material bank accounts and (ii) will not benefit from any credit support from the Issuers, the
Guarantors or any of their respective subsidiaries. The PIK Notes will be senior obligations of Vertical Topco II
and will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations of the subsidiaries of Vertical Topco II,
including obligations in respect of the Notes, the Private Senior Notes and the Senior Facilities. The indenture
governing the PIK Notes will contain certain restrictive covenants, which, subject to certain exceptions
(including, among other things, to reflect the position of the PIK Notes in the capital structure), will be
substantially similar to the covenants governing the Notes. In connection with the issuance of the PIK Notes,
Vertical Topco II will enter into a collateral sharing agreement with respect to the aforementioned security
interests.

**Local Guarantee Facilities**

The Group issues a large number of low to moderate value (in the context of the size and operations of the
business of the Group) non-financial bids, advance payments, bonds, performance bonds, sureties, trade
contracts, guarantees and other similar and/or like instruments performance and warranty guarantees (the
“Guarantees”) as part of its general day-to-day business operations and business practices. As of March 31, 2020,
the aggregate number of these guarantees which had been issued on behalf of the Group had an approximate
value of €2,032 million pursuant to 29,000 individual guarantees with around 92 separate groups of financial
institutions.

The Guarantees are generally issued low to moderate value (in the context of the size and operations of the
business of the Group) (with approximately 80% with a nominal value of less than €20,000) and generally on a
short to medium tenor (with approximately 72% not exceeding a tenor of 36 months). The frequency of claims or
calls on these Guarantees is (based on the historic figures) generally low (with approximately five claims in
excess of €3 million over the last three financial years) under the total guarantee portfolio of the Group. The
majority of the Seller Guarantee Facilities and Local Target Guarantee Facilities (each, as defined below) are
on-demand facilities, which can be called by the relevant financial institution at any time.

Historically, the Guarantees have been issued through one of, or a combination of, the following methods:
(i) central guarantee facilities of thyssenkrupp AG and other financing companies of the thyssenkrupp Group,
(ii) corporate guarantees issued by thyssenkrupp AG, or (iii) parent company guarantees issued by thyssenkrupp
AG, (together the “Seller Guarantee Facilities”); or by individual Group entities at a local entity level under their
own guarantee facilities with certain financial institutions mostly secured by a letter of comfort of
thyssenkrupp AG (“Local Target Guarantee Facilities”) as well as parent company guarantees issued by
thyssenkrupp Elevator.

As at and from the Acquisition Closing Date, all of the Seller Guarantee Facilities and Local Target Guarantee
Facilities will be rolled over, replaced and/or backstopped with guarantee instruments issued to the relevant
issuing financial institutions under the Guarantee Facility or to thyssenkrupp AG. See “—Senior Facilities
_Agreement.”_

**Local Credit Facilities**

As of March 31, 2020, we also had local credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount equal to €4.4 million

re-utilization, subject to the terms and conditions of the facility letter.

Each tranche accrues interest on a daily basis and is subject to the imposition of default interest according to the
terms and conditions of the facility letter.

The facilities are available to thyssenkrupp Elevator Morocco to finance its working capital requirements, for
other general corporate purposes and in connection with the issuance of guarantees or bonds.

is required to maintain more than a 50% aggregate shareholding (directly or indirectly) in thyssenkrupp Elevator
Morocco and to notify the lender of any decrease in such shareholding.

As of December 19, 2019, the bonding/guarantee line was terminated and thyssenkrupp Elevator Morocco agreed
with the lender that all remaining amounts outstanding under Facility A must be repaid before the finalization of
the dissolution of thyssenkrupp Elevator Morocco or on September 30, 2020, whichever occurs earlier.

The facility is supported by a letter of comfort issued by thyssenkrupp AG.

As of March 31, 2020, an aggregate principal amount of MAD 7.0 million (€0.6 million (equivalent)) was drawn
under the cash facilities.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES**

The following is a description of the €750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of % Senior Secured Notes
due 2027 (the “Euro Fixed Rate Notes”), the €1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Senior
Secured Notes due 2027 (the “Euro FRN Notes” and, together with the Euro Fixed Rate Notes, the “Euro Notes”)
and the €1,250,000,000 (USD equivalent) aggregate principal amount of % Senior Secured Notes due 2027
(the “Dollar Fixed Rate Notes” and, together with the Euro Notes, the “Notes”). The Euro Notes will be issued
by Vertical Midco GmbH, a Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung organized under the laws of Germany (the
“Euro Issuer” or the “Company”). The Dollar Fixed Rate Notes will be issued by Vertical U.S. Newco Inc., a
corporation organized under the laws of Delaware (the “Dollar Issuer” and, together with the Euro Issuer, the
“Issuers”) and an indirect subsidiary of the Company. For purposes of this “Description of the Senior Secured
Notes,” references to (i) the “Euro Issuer” and the “Company” refer only to Vertical Midco GmbH and none of
its subsidiaries, (ii) the “Dollar Issuer” refer only to Vertical U.S. Newco Inc. and none of its subsidiaries and
(iii) “we,” “our,” “Group” and “us” refer only to the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries.

The proceeds from the offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date, together with the Equity Contribution (as
defined below), the proceeds of the Senior Notes (as defined below) sold on the Issue Date and borrowings under
the Senior Facilities Agreement (as defined below), will be used by the Company to finance the Acquisition and
to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions, as set forth in this offering memorandum
under the caption “Use of Proceeds.” Pending consummation of the Acquisition and the satisfaction of certain
other conditions as described below, the Issuers will, concurrently with the closing of the offering of the Notes on
the Issue Date, deposit, or cause to be deposited on their behalf, an amount in cash equal to (i) the gross proceeds
of the Euro Fixed Rate Notes sold on the Issue Date into the Euro Fixed Escrow Account (as defined below), (ii)
the gross proceeds of the Euro FRN Notes sold on the Issue Date into the Euro FRN Escrow Account (as defined
below) and (iii) the gross proceeds of the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes sold on the Issue Date into the Dollar Fixed
Escrow Account (as defined below). In the event that (i) the Escrow Longstop Date (as defined below) occurs
and the Escrow Agent (as defined below) shall not have received the Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate (as
defined below) on or prior to such date or (ii) the Company informs the Escrow Agent in writing that, in the good
faith judgment of the Company, the Acquisition will not be consummated on or prior to the Escrow Longstop
Date, the Issuers will redeem the entire outstanding aggregate principal amount of each series of the Notes at a
price equal to 100% of the issue price of the Notes as stated on the cover page of this offering memorandum, plus
accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes and Additional Amounts, if any, from, and including, the Issue Date to,
but excluding, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below). See “Escrow of Proceeds; Special
Mandatory Redemption.” Upon the initial issuance of the Notes on the Issue Date, the Notes will only be
obligations of the Issuers and the Initial Guarantors (as defined below) and will not be guaranteed by the Target
or any of its Subsidiaries. Assuming the Acquisition Closing Date occurs on or prior to the Escrow Longstop
Date and the funds are released from the Escrow Accounts (as defined below), the Post-Closing Guarantors will,
within 150 days from (and excluding) the Acquisition Closing Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles
and substantially concurrently with the guarantees granted in favor of obligations under the Senior Facilities
Agreement, accede to the Indenture (as defined below) and the Intercreditor Agreement and guarantee the Notes
on a senior secured basis.

Prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, neither the Company nor the Initial Guarantors will control the Target or
any of its Subsidiaries, and none of the Target or any of its Subsidiaries will be subject to the covenants
described in this “Description of the Senior Secured Notes.” As such, we cannot assure you that, prior to the
Acquisition Closing Date, the Target Group will not engage in activities that would otherwise have been
prohibited by the Indenture had those covenants been applicable to such entities as of the Issue Date and any such
non-compliance will not constitute a Default or Event of Default under the Indenture prior to the Acquisition
Closing Date.

The Issuers will issue the Notes under an indenture (the “Indenture”), to be dated as of the Issue Date, among,
_inter alios, the Company, the other Initial Guarantors (as defined below), Deutsche Trustee Company Limited, as_
trustee (the “Trustee”), and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as security agent (the “Security Agent”). The
Notes will be issued in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities
Act. See “Notice to Certain Investors.” The Notes are subject to all such terms pursuant to the provisions of the
Indenture, and Holders are referred to the Indenture for a statement thereof.

The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and refers to the Notes, the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Security Documents and the Escrow Agreement. Because this is a summary, it may not contain
all the information that is important to you. You should read each of the Indenture, the Notes, the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Security Documents and the Escrow Agreement in their entirety. Copies of such documents are

216


-----

available as described under “Where You Can Find Other Information.” You can find the definitions of certain
terms used in this description under “—Certain Definitions” below. The capitalized terms defined in “—Certain
Definitions” below are used in this “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” as so defined.

The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements (as defined below) and in the case of a conflict between anything in the Indenture, the Notes or the
Security Documents (other than any Transaction Security Documents which are governed by German law and
which need to be notarized) and anything in the Intercreditor Agreement, the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement will prevail. The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the relative
ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, the procedures
for undertaking enforcement action, the subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of
security and guarantees, and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent. See “Description
of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” for a description of certain terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

The Company will not be required to, nor does the Company currently intend to, offer to exchange the Notes for
notes registered under the Securities Act or otherwise register or qualify by prospectus the Notes for resale under
the Securities Act. The Indenture will not be qualified under, or incorporate by reference or include, or be subject
to, any provisions of the Trust Indenture Act, including Section 316(b) thereof. Accordingly, the terms of the
Notes include only those stated in the Indenture, and the Holders will not be entitled to the protections provided
under the Trust Indenture Act to holders of debt securities issued under a qualified indenture, including among
other things, those requiring the Trustee to resign in the event of certain conflicts of interest and to inform
Holders of certain relationships between it and us.

**Brief Description of the Notes and the Note Guarantees**

Prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, the Euro Notes and the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes will initially be
senior obligations solely of the Euro Issuer and the Dollar Issuer, respectively, guaranteed solely by the Initial
Guarantors, secured by the Issue Date Collateral (as defined below) and the respective Escrowed Property (as
defined below) and will not have the benefit of any Guarantees or any other credit support from thyssenkrupp
Elevator AG (the “Target”) or any of its Subsidiaries (together, the “Target Group”). Prior to the Acquisition
Closing Date, neither the Company nor the Initial Guarantors will control the Target or any of its Subsidiaries,
and none of the Target or any of its Subsidiaries will be subject to the covenants described in this “Description of
the Senior Secured Notes.” As such, we cannot assure you that, prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, the Target
Group will not engage in activities that would otherwise have been prohibited by the Indenture had those
covenants been applicable to such entities as of the Issue Date and any such non-compliance will not constitute a
Default or Event of Default under the Indenture prior to the Acquisition Closing Date.

From and after the consummation of the Acquisition, the Euro Notes and the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes will:

- be general senior obligations of the Euro Issuer and the Dollar Issuer, respectively, secured as set forth
under “Security”;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of the Euro Issuer and the
Dollar Issuer, respectively, that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including their
respective obligations in respect of the Senior Facilities and certain Hedging Obligations;

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of the Euro Issuer and the Dollar
Issuer, respectively, that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including their
respective obligations in respect of the Public Senior Notes, the Private Senior Notes and any Topco
Proceeds Loan;

- be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or other liabilities of the Euro Issuer and
the Dollar Issuer, respectively, and their respective subsidiaries that is secured by property or assets that do
not secure the Notes, to the extent of the property and value of the assets securing such Indebtedness or
liabilities;

- be structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities, including preferred
stock and obligations to trade creditors, of Subsidiaries of the Euro Issuer and the Dollar Issuer,
respectively, that are not Guarantors;

- be guaranteed on a senior basis (i) on the Issue Date, by the Initial Guarantors and (ii) within 150 days from
the Acquisition Closing Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and substantially concurrently with
the guarantees granted in favor of obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Post-Closing
Guarantors; and

217


-----

- be represented by one or more registered Notes in global form, but in certain circumstances may be
represented by certificated Notes. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.”

Each Note Guarantee (as defined below) will:

- be a general senior obligation of the Guarantor, secured as set forth under “Security”;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of such Guarantor that is not
subordinated in right of payment to the Note Guarantee of such Guarantor, including its obligations in
respect of the Senior Facilities and certain Hedging Obligations;

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of such Guarantor that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Note Guarantee of such Guarantor, including its obligations in
respect of its guarantee of the Senior Notes;

- be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness or other liabilities of such Guarantor and
its subsidiaries that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes or the Note Guarantees to
the extent of the value of the assets securing such Indebtedness or liabilities; and

- be structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities, including preferred
stock and obligations to trade creditors, of Subsidiaries of such Guarantor that are not Guarantors.

As of March 31, 2020, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries would have had € million (equivalent) of total Indebtedness, including (i) € million
(equivalent) of Indebtedness secured on the Collateral on a first-priority basis, consisting of € million
(equivalent) of term loan drawings under the Senior Facilities Agreement and € million (equivalent)
under the Notes and (ii) € million (equivalent) of Indebtedness secured on a portion of the Collateral on a
second-priority basis and the Topco Independent Collateral (as defined under “Description of the Senior Notes”)
on a first-priority basis, consisting of € million (equivalent) under the Senior Notes.

**Principal and Maturity**

On the Issue Date, the Euro Issuer will issue € million aggregate principal amount Euro Fixed Rate Notes
and € million aggregate principal amount Euro FRN Notes, and the Dollar Issuer will issue
$ million aggregate principal amount Dollar Fixed Rate Notes. The Notes will mature on, 2027.
Each series of Euro Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of
€1,000 in excess thereof. The Dollar Fixed Rate Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of $200,000
and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream are not required to monitor or enforce the minimum amount. The rights of Holders of beneficial
interests in the Notes to receive the payments on such Notes are subject to applicable procedures of DTC,
Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a
Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to
payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any
further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

**Interest**

_Euro Fixed Rate Notes_

Interest on the Euro Fixed Rate Notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum and will be payable, in cash,
semi-annually in arrears on and of each year, commencing on, 2021, to Holders of record
on the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable interest payment date. Interest on the Euro Fixed Rate
Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from
the date of original issuance. Interest on overdue principal and interest on the Euro Fixed Rate Notes will accrue
at a rate that is 1% higher than the interest rate on the overdue principal or interest. Interest will be computed on
the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. Each interest period will end on (but not
include) the relevant interest payment date. If the Company delivers global notes to the Trustee for cancellation
on a date that is on or after the record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment date, the accrued
and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date will be paid on the redemption date to the Holder in
whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date in accordance with the applicable
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will
be subject to redemption by the Company.

218


-----

_Euro FRN Notes_

Interest on the Euro FRN Notes will accrue at a rate per annum computed against the principal outstanding on the
Euro FRN Notes (the “Applicable Rate”), reset quarterly, equal to EURIBOR (which is subject to a 0.00% floor)
plus %, as determined by an agent appointed by the Company to calculate EURIBOR for the purposes of the
Indenture (the “Calculation Agent”), which shall initially be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch.

Interest on the Euro FRN Notes will be payable, in cash, quarterly in arrears on,, and
of each year, commencing on, 2020. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Euro FRN
Notes is not a Business Day or a business day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder
thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day or business day
at such place, as the case may be, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of
any such delay. If a regular record date is not a Business Day, the record date shall not be affected. The Company
will pay interest to the Holders of record on the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable interest
payment date. The Euro FRN Notes will bear interest from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid,
from the date it was most recently paid.

The Calculation Agent will, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m., London time, on each Determination Date,
determine the Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable on the Euro FRN Notes in
respect of the following Interest Period (the “Interest Amount”). The Interest Amount will be calculated by
applying the Applicable Rate to the principal amount of the Euro FRN Notes outstanding at the commencement
of the Interest Period, multiplying each such amount by the actual number of days in the Interest Period
concerned divided by 365; provided that interest shall only be paid in respect of Euro FRN Notes outstanding on
the applicable interest payment dates.

All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one
hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards
(e.g., 4.876545% (or 0.04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or 0.0487655)). All euro amounts used in or
resulting from such calculations will be rounded to the nearest euro cent (with one-half euro cent being rounded
upwards). The determination of the Applicable Rate and the Interest Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in
the absence of willful default, bad faith or manifest error, be binding on all parties. The Trustee and the Paying
Agent shall not be responsible for, nor incur any liability in connection with, any loss resulting from any
calculation made, or intended to be made, by the Calculation Agent.

If the Company determines that the EURIBOR rate is no longer being calculated or administered, or it becomes
illegal for the Calculation Agent to determine any amounts due to be paid, as at the relevant Determination Date,
any alternative rate which has replaced EURIBOR in customary market usage for the purposes of determining
floating rates of interest in respect of euro-denominated securities, as identified by the Company, in consultation
with an Independent Financial Advisor appointed by the Company, and promptly thereafter notified by the
Company to the Holders and the Calculation Agent, the Principal Paying Agent and the Trustee shall be the new
rate replacing EURIBOR (the “EURIBOR Successor Rate”); provided, however, that if the Independent Financial
Advisor determines that there is no clear market consensus as to whether any rate has replaced EURIBOR in
customary market usage, the Independent Financial Advisor shall determine an appropriate alternative rate, and
the decision of the Independent Financial Advisor will be binding on the Company, the Calculation Agent and
the Holders, and the Company shall certify (by way of an Officer’s Certificate) to each of the Trustee, the
Calculation Agent and the Paying Agent, at least ten Business Days prior to any Determination Date, such
EURIBOR Successor Rate (upon which each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to rely conclusively and absolutely without further enquiry, investigation, verification or liability of any
kind whatsoever), which shall be used by the Calculation Agent to calculate the Applicable Rate. Holders shall
be bound by any such EURIBOR Successor Rate without any further action or consent by the Holders of the
Trustee; provided further that any such alternative rate adopted pursuant to this paragraph shall in all cases never
be less than 0.00%. Following the adoption of an alternative rate pursuant to this paragraph, all references to
“EURIBOR” in the Indenture shall be deemed (provided that the EURIBOR Successor Rate does not, without the
prior agreement of the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent, as applicable, have the effect of
increasing the obligations or duties, or decreasing the rights or protections, of the Trustee, Paying Agent or the
Calculation Agent under the Indenture) to refer to such alternative rate.

The Calculation Agent will, upon the written request of the Holder of any Euro FRN Notes, provide the interest
rate then in effect with respect to the Euro FRN Notes. The rights of holders of beneficial interests in the Euro
FRN Notes to receive payments on such Euro FRN Notes are subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream.

219


-----

Interest will be computed on the basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of days elapsed. The Applicable
Rate on the Euro FRN Notes will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.

Set forth below is a summary of certain of the defined terms used in the Indenture relating to the calculation of
interest on the Euro FRN Notes:

“Determination Date,” with respect to an Interest Period, will be the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days
preceding the first day of such Interest Period, except that the initial Determination Date will be, 2020.

“EURIBOR” with respect to an Interest Period, will be the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for
deposits in euros for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the
Determination Date that appears on Reuters Page EURIBOR1 as of 11:00 a.m. Brussels time, on the
Determination Date; provided, however, that EURIBOR shall never be less than 0.00%. If Reuters Page
EURIBOR1 does not include such a rate or is unavailable on a Determination Date, the Company will request the
principal London office of each of four major banks in the Eurozone inter-bank market, as selected by the
Company, to provide such bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately
11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the Eurozone inter-bank market for
deposits in a Representative Amount in euros for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET
Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, the rate for
the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so
provided, the Company will request each of three major banks in London, as selected by the Company, to
provide such bank’s rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time,
on such Determination Date, for loans in a Representative Amount in euros to leading European banks for a
three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If
at least two such rates are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If
fewer than two such rates are so provided then the rate for the Interest Period will be the rate in effect with
respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period.

“Eurozone” means the region comprised of member states of the European Union that adopt the euro.

“Interest Period” means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and ending on but
excluding the next succeeding interest payment date, with the exception that the first Interest Period shall
commence on and include the Issue Date and end on and exclude, 2020.

“Representative Amount” means the greater of (a) €1.0 million and (b) an amount that is representative for a
single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.

“Reuters Page EURIBOR1” means the display page so designated by Reuters (or such other page as may replace
that page on that service or such other service as may be nominated as the information vendor).

“TARGET Settlement Day” means any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement
Express Transfer (TARGET2) System is open for the settlement of payments in euro.

_Dollar Fixed Rate Notes_

Interest on the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum and will be payable, in cash,
semi-annually in arrears on and of each year, commencing on, 2021, to Holders of record
on and preceding the applicable interest payment date. Interest on the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes
will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the
date of original issuance. Interest on overdue principal and interest on the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes will accrue at
a rate that is 1% higher than the interest rate on the overdue principal or interest. Interest will be computed on the
basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. Each interest period will end on (but not include)
the relevant interest payment date. If the Company delivers global notes to the Trustee for cancellation on a date
that is on or after the record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment date, the accrued and
unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date will be paid on the redemption date to the Holder in
whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date in accordance with the applicable
procedures of DTC, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to
redemption by the Company.

Any Notes represented by global notes held by a nominee of DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream will be subject
to the then applicable procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable. Euroclear’s and
Clearstream’s current practice is to make payments in respect of global notes to participants of record that hold
an interest in the relevant global notes on the business day immediately preceding the applicable interest payment
date.

**Additional Notes**

The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which € million aggregate principal

_Rate Notes” and, together with any Additional Euro Notes, the “Additional Notes”), from time to time under the_
Indenture, subject to compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture. Any series of Additional Euro
Fixed Rate Notes, Additional Euro FRN Notes and Additional Dollar Fixed Rate Notes shall have terms

such series in such Officer’s Certificate; provided that any Additional Notes that are not fungible with the
applicable series of Notes offered hereunder for U.S. federal income tax purposes shall have a separate ISIN,
Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number from such Notes. Unless the context otherwise
requires, for all purposes of the Indenture and this “Description of the Senior Secured Notes,” references to
“Notes” shall be deemed to include references to the Notes initially issued on the Issue Date as well as any

or other payment as a result of any such delay.

**Paying Agents, Registrars and Transfer Agents for the Notes**

The Company will maintain a Paying Agent for the Euro Notes in London, United Kingdom (including the initial
Principal Paying Agent). The initial Principal Paying Agent will be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch. In
addition, the Company will maintain a Paying Agent for the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes in the Borough of
Manhattan, City of New York, New York (including the initial Dollar Paying Agent). The initial Dollar Paying

respectively, on behalf of the Issuers.

Upon written notice to the Trustee, the Company may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent for
the Notes without prior notice to the Holders of such Notes. However, for so long as Notes are listed on the
Official List of The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Exchange”) and if and to the extent
that the rules of the Exchange so require, the Company will notify the Exchange of any change of Paying Agent,
Registrar or Transfer Agent. The Company or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in
respect of the Notes provided that it segregates and holds in a separate trust fund for the benefit of the Holders all
money held by it as paying agent.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The applicable registrar and the
Trustee may require a Holder to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents in connection with a
transfer of Notes. Holders will be required to pay all taxes due on transfer. Any such transfer or exchange will be

222


-----

made without charge to Holders, other than any taxes payable in connection with such transfer. The Company
and the applicable transfer agent will not be required to transfer or exchange any Note selected for redemption or
tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control Offer or an Asset
Disposition Offer (each as defined herein). Also, the Company and the applicable transfer agent and registrar will
not be required to transfer or exchange any Note for a period of 15 days before the delivery of a notice of
redemption of Notes to be redeemed or between record date and payment date. The registered Holder of a Note
will be treated as the absolute owner of the Note for all purposes. See “Book Entry, Delivery and Form.”

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

As of the Issue Date, each Initial Guarantor (other than the Company in respect of its Note Guarantee of the
Dollar Fixed Rate Notes) will be a “Restricted Subsidiary” of the Company for the purposes of the Indenture.
Immediately after the completion of the Acquisition on the Acquisition Closing Date, the Target and all of its
subsidiaries as of such date will become Restricted Subsidiaries of the Company. However, in the circumstances
described below under “—Certain Covenants—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries,” the
Company will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted
Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not guarantee, or
provide security with respect to, the Notes.

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption**

This offering of the Notes will be consummated prior to the consummation of the Acquisition. Substantially
concurrently with the closing of the offering of the Notes on the Issue Date, the Issuers will enter into an escrow
agreement (as amended, supplemented or modified from time to time, the “Escrow Agreement”) among the
Issuers, the Trustee, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch as euro escrow agent (in such capacity, together with its
successors, the “Euro Escrow Agent”) and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch as dollar escrow agent (in such
capacity, together with its successors, the “Dollar Escrow Agent”), pursuant to which the Issuers will deposit, or
cause to be deposited on their behalf, an amount in cash equal to (x) the gross proceeds of the Euro Fixed Rate
Notes sold on the Issue Date into one escrow account (the “Euro Fixed Escrow Account”), (y) the gross proceeds
of the Euro FRN Notes sold on the Issue Date into another escrow account (the “Euro FRN Escrow Account”)
and (z) the gross proceeds of the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes sold on the Issue Date into a third escrow account (the
“Dollar Fixed Escrow Account” and, together with the Euro Fixed Escrow Account and the Euro FRN Escrow
Account, the “Escrow Accounts”). The Escrow Accounts established will each be segregated from the Issuers’
other funds. The Escrow Accounts will be controlled by the Euro Escrow Agent, in the case of the Euro Fixed
Escrow Account and the Euro FRN Escrow Account, and the Dollar Escrow Agent, in the case of the Dollar
Fixed Escrow Account, in each case subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, on behalf of the Trustee and
the Holders of the applicable series of Notes. The initial funds deposited in the Escrow Accounts, and all other
funds, securities, interest, dividends, distributions and other property and payments credited to the Escrow
Accounts in connection with the Notes (less any property and/or funds paid in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement such as ordinary course charges and fees paid to the bank holding the Escrow Accounts) are referred
to, collectively, as the “Escrowed Property.” Interest will be calculated in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture and the Notes.

To secure the payment of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price (as defined below) of the Euro Fixed Rate
Notes, the Euro FRN Notes and the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes, as applicable, the Issuers will grant the Trustee, for
its benefit and the benefit of the Holders of the applicable series of Notes, subject to certain liens of the Escrow
Agent, a first-priority security interest in the Euro Fixed Escrow Account, the Euro FRN Escrow Account and the
Dollar Fixed Escrow Account, as applicable, and the Issuers’ rights under the Escrow Agreement, pursuant to
one or more escrow account charges dated the Issue Date between the Issuers, the Trustee and the Escrow Agent
(the “Escrow Charges”); provided, however that such liens and security interest shall automatically be released
and terminate upon receipt by the Trustee of either an Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate (as defined below) or
a notice of Special Mandatory Redemption (as defined below). The Escrow Charges will provide that the funds
will be segregated and held for the purposes specified herein. By its acceptance of the Notes, each Holder shall
be deemed to authorize and direct the Trustee to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Escrow
Agreement. The Escrow Agent will invest the Escrowed Property as directed by the Issuers in such short-term
liquid investments (including bank deposit products) as permitted under the Escrow Agreement, and liquidate
such investments, as the Issuers will from time to time direct in writing.

The Escrow Agreement shall provide for the Escrow Agent to release from each Escrow Account, upon
instruction of the Company or the applicable Issuer, a portion of the Escrowed Property in an amount equal to the
amount of accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from, and including, the Issue Date or the

223


-----

most recent interest payment date, as applicable, to, but excluding, any interest payment date prior to the Escrow
Release in order to satisfy the interest payment obligations in respect of the Euro Fixed Rate Notes, the Euro
FRN Notes or the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes, as applicable, under the Indenture as set forth under “—Principal,
Maturity and Interest.” In addition, the Escrow Agent will be entitled pursuant to the Escrow Agreement to
deduct amounts from the Escrowed Property in respect of negative interest having accrued on the Escrowed
Property.

Other than in connection with the payment of interest and Additional Amounts, if any, as set forth in the previous
paragraph, the Company and the applicable Issuer will be entitled to cause the Escrow Agent to release Escrowed
Property (in which case the Escrowed Property will be paid to, or as directed by, the Company or such Issuer)
(the “Escrow Release”) (the date of the Escrow Release being referred to as the “Escrow Release Date”) upon
delivery to the Escrow Agent, on or prior to December 31, 2020 (the “Escrow Longstop Date”), of an Officer’s
Certificate (the “Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate”), upon which the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely
absolutely without further investigation, certifying that the following conditions (collectively, the “Escrow
_Conditions”) will be met substantially concurrently with or promptly following the Release on the Escrow_
Release Date:

(1) the funds required to pay the consideration for the Acquisition will be required promptly (and in any event
within two Business Days) following the release of the Escrowed Property to consummate the Acquisition
substantially on the terms set forth under “Summary—The Transactions”; and

(2) the conditions precedent to borrowing under the Senior Facilities (other than any condition precedent
relating to the Release or satisfaction of the Escrow Conditions) shall have been, or substantially
concurrently shall be, satisfied or waived in all material respects.

Upon the Escrow Release, the Escrowed Property will be paid out of the Escrow Accounts in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement for the purposes described under “Use of Proceeds” and the Escrow Accounts will be reduced
to zero.

In the event that (i) the Escrow Longstop Date occurs and the Escrow Agent shall not have received the Escrow
Release Officer’s Certificate on or prior to such date or (ii) the Company informs the Escrow Agent and the
Trustee in writing that, in the good faith judgment of the Company, the Acquisition will not be consummated on
or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, (the date of any such event being the “Special Termination Date”), the
Issuers will redeem the entire outstanding aggregate principal amount of each series of the Notes (the “Special
_Mandatory Redemption”) at a price (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Price”) equal to 100% of the issue_
price of such series of Notes as stated on the cover page of this offering memorandum, plus accrued and unpaid
interest on the Notes and Additional Amounts, if any, from, and including, the Issue Date to, but excluding, the
Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below), subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date.

Notice of the Special Mandatory Redemption will be delivered by the Company no later than one Business Day
following the Special Termination Date, to the Trustee, the Escrow Agent and the Paying Agents, and will
provide that the Notes shall be redeemed on a date that is no later than the tenth Business Day after such notice is
given by the Company in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement (the “Special Mandatory
_Redemption Date”). On the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Paying_
Agents for payment to each Holder of Notes the Special Mandatory Redemption Price for such Holder’s Notes,
shall be entitled to use the Escrowed Property to make such payments and, concurrently with the payment to such
Holders, deliver any excess Escrowed Property (if any) to the Company. Notice of such Special Mandatory
Redemption shall be given to the Holders of the Notes at least five Business Days before the Special Mandatory
Redemption Date.

The Escrow Accounts will not include cash to fund any accrued and unpaid interest owing to Holders of the
Notes, which is included in the Special Mandatory Redemption Price. In the event that the Special Mandatory
Redemption Price payable upon such Special Mandatory Redemption of the Euro Fixed Rate Notes, Euro FRN
Notes or Dollar Fixed Rate Notes exceeds the amount of the applicable Escrowed Property, Topco will be
required to make an equity contribution to the Company to fund the difference between the applicable Special
Mandatory Redemption Price and the amount of the Escrowed Property pursuant to a commitment provided by it.

The Company or the applicable Issuer from time to time, but not more than twice in aggregate, may open one or
more replacement or additional accounts at an alternative bank or banks, which in each case must be an Initial
Purchaser or one or more of their respective banking affiliates, and may transfer any portion of the Escrowed
Property to any such replacement or additional accounts (a “Transfer”) without such Transfer being deemed a
Release; provided that the Company and each Issuer provide a substantially equivalent security interest to the

224


-----

Trustee for the benefit of the Holders over such replacement or additional account or accounts if such security
interest was initially granted in connection with the original Escrow Account; and provided further that use of the
funds from any such account shall be subject to the same conditions as applied to the original Escrow Account.
In such an event, any replacement or alternative accounts into which Escrowed Property is transferred shall be
deemed to be an Escrow Account. Receipt by the Trustee from the Company or the applicable Issuer of an
Officer’s Certificate in connection with a Transfer shall constitute deemed consent by the Trustee for the transfer
of the Escrowed Property from the original Escrow Account to a new Escrow Account.

If at the time of such Special Mandatory Redemption, the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange
and the rules of the Exchange so require, the Company will notify the Exchange that the Special Mandatory
Redemption has occurred and any relevant details relating to such Special Mandatory Redemption.

In addition, the conditions applicable to a Special Mandatory Redemption may be waived or modified by Holders
representing a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

**Note Guarantees**

**_General_**

On the Issue Date, the obligations of the Issuers under the Notes and the Indenture will be, jointly and severally,
unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis (the “Note Guarantees”) by the Initial Guarantors. Subject to the
Agreed Security Principles, within 150 days from the Acquisition Closing Date and substantially concurrently
with the guarantees granted in favor of obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Notes are expected
to be guaranteed on a senior basis by thyssenkrupp Elevator Corp., thyssenkrupp Aufzüge GmbH, Tepper
Aufzüge GmbH, thyssenkrupp Elevator (Canada) Limited., thyssenkrupp Elevator Manufacturing Inc.,
thyssenkrupp Stairlifts B.V., and SkyLift B.V. (the “Post-Closing Guarantors”). The Senior Facilities will be
guaranteed on a senior basis by each Post-Closing Guarantor. In addition, the Original Guarantee Facility and the
Original Revolving Credit Facility made available under the Senior Facilities Agreement will be guaranteed by
thyssenkrupp Elevadores, S.L.U. which is barred from granting a guarantee of the Senior Term Facilities and a
Note Guarantee pursuant to Spanish financial assistance laws. In addition, if required by the covenant described
under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries” and subject
to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may
provide a Note Guarantee in the future and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement. For the twelve months ended
March 31, 2020, on a consolidated basis and excluding statistical corporate cost allocations, the Post-Closing
Guarantors generated 62.8% of the Target Group’s consolidated EBITDA and 44.5% of the Target Group’s
consolidated sales. As of March 31, 2020, on a consolidated basis and excluding the value of the “thyssenkrupp”
brand (the license for which will automatically terminate 18 months after the Acquisition Closing Date), the
Post-Closing Guarantors accounted for 36.4% of the Target Group’s consolidated assets.

The obligations of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would
not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law to comply with corporate benefit,
financial assistance and other laws. In addition, the Note Guarantees will be further limited as required under the
Agreed Security Principles as described below under “Security—General.” The Agreed Security Principles apply
to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Notes
and the Topco Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where,
among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements,
financial assistance rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent preference rules, “thin capitalization” rules, capital
maintenance rules, retention of title claims and similar matters, or where the time and cost of granting the
guarantee would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders. By virtue of these limitations, a
Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to
the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee. For example, due to
Spanish financial assistance laws thyssenkrupp Elevadores, S.L.U. is barred from granting a guarantee of the
Senior Term Facilities and a Note Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—
Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Note Guarantees
and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral”
and “—The insolvency laws of Germany and other applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable to you as the
insolvency laws of the United States or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other
limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests (as defined herein), including fraudulent
conveyance statutes, may adversely affect their validity and enforceability.” The validity and enforceability of
the Note Guarantees and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in “Certain

225


-----

Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and
Security Interests.”

The Company is a holding company and its only material assets are its interests in the capital and loan stock of
its Subsidiaries. The Dollar Issuer is an indirect subsidiary of the Company and, as of the consummation of the
Acquisition, its only material assets will be its interests in the capital and loan stock of its Subsidiaries. As such,
the Issuers will be dependent upon the Restricted Subsidiaries to make payments to them to service interest,
principal and other payments on the Notes.

A significant portion of the operations of the Company will be conducted through Subsidiaries that are not
expected to become Guarantors, including Subsidiaries exempt from becoming Guarantors or having security
granted over their shares or assets under the Agreed Security Principles. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantors,
including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those
Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries and claims against
joint ventures generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries and joint
ventures over the claims of creditors of the Issuers and the Guarantors, including Holders. The Notes and each
Note Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred
and minority stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Company (other than the Guarantors) and joint ventures.
Although the Indenture limits the incurrence of Indebtedness (including Disqualified Stock, and Preferred Stock
of Restricted Subsidiaries), the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the
Indenture does not impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not
considered Indebtedness under the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

**_Note Guarantee Releases_**

The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon:

(1) a direct or indirect sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including by way of merger, amalgamation,
consolidation, dividend distribution or otherwise) of (i) the Capital Stock of such Guarantor (as a result of
which such Guarantor would no longer be a Restricted Subsidiary), or (ii) all or substantially all the assets
of the Guarantor, to a Person other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary and otherwise in
compliance with the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(2) the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(3) legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes and the Indenture, as
provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge;”

(4) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(5) upon the release or discharge of the Guarantee and any other obligations of such Guarantor under the Senior
Facilities Agreement, provided that (i) as of the next applicable test date after giving effect to such release
and any applicable clean-up period, the Guarantor Coverage Test (as defined in the Senior Facilities
Agreement) is met, calculated in accordance with, and in the manner provided by and subject to the same
exceptions as those set forth in the Senior Facilities Agreement as in effect on the Acquisition Closing Date
and (ii) such Guarantor also releases its Note Guarantee under the Senior Notes;

(6) as described in the second paragraph of the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(7) upon the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of any Guarantor with and into the Company or another
Guarantor or upon the liquidation of such Guarantor, in each case, in compliance with the covenant under
“—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”;

(8) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization;

(9) upon the achievement of Investment Grade Status by the Notes; and

(10) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers.”

The Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, shall, subject to receipt of certain documentation requested
pursuant to the Indenture, take all necessary actions at the reasonable request and cost of the Company, including
the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
to effectuate any release of a Note Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary
protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee without the
consent of the Holders and will not require any other action or consent on the part of the Trustee. Neither the

226


-----

Trustee nor the Issuers will be required to make a notation on the Notes to reflect any such release, termination or
discharge. The Issuers may in their sole discretion elect to have any Note Guarantee remain in place, as opposed
to being released.

**Security**

**_General_**

On the Issue Date, the Notes and the Note Guarantees in respect thereof will be secured on a first-priority basis
by the Escrow Charges. Upon receipt by the Trustee of either an Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate or a notice
of Special Mandatory Redemption, the Escrowed Property will be released and the first-priority security interests
over the Escrowed Property will automatically be released and terminate. In addition, the Notes and the Note
Guarantees in respect thereof will be secured on the Issue Date on a first-priority basis by (collectively, the
“Issue Date Collateral”):

- a share pledge in respect of Topco’s shares in the capital of the Company pursuant to a German law
governed share pledge agreement;

- a security assignment in respect of any structural intercompany receivables owed to Topco by the Company
pursuant to a German law governed security assignment agreement;

- a share pledge in respect of the Company’s shares in the capital of Newco pursuant to a German law
governed share pledge agreement;

- a security assignment in respect of any structural intercompany receivables owed to the Company by Newco
pursuant to a German law governed security assignment agreement;

- a pledge in respect of the Company’s material bank accounts in Germany (without control over use and
freely operational prior to acceleration) pursuant to a German law governed bank account pledge agreement;

- a share pledge in respect of Newco’s shares in the capital of Bidco pursuant to a German law governed share
pledge agreement;

- a security assignment in respect of any structural intercompany receivables owed to Newco by Bidco
pursuant to a German law governed security assignment agreement;

- a pledge in respect of Newco’s material bank accounts in Germany (without control over use and freely
operational prior to acceleration) pursuant to a German law governed bank account pledge agreement;

- a pledge in respect of Newco’s shares in the capital of the Dollar Issuer and all structural intercompany
receivables owed to Newco by the Dollar Issuer pursuant to a New York law governed security agreement;
and

- a pledge in respect of Bidco’s material bank accounts in Germany (without control over use and freely
operational prior to acceleration) pursuant to a German law governed bank account pledge agreement;

- security interests over all assets of the Dollar Issuer pursuant to a New York law governed security
agreement (subject to customary exclusions).

In addition, within 150 days from (and excluding) the Acquisition Closing Date, subject to the Agreed Security
Principles and substantially simultaneously with the obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Notes
and the Note Guarantees will be secured by (collectively, the “Post-Closing Collateral” and, together with the
Issue Date Collateral, the “Collateral”):

- share pledges in respect of the shares in the capital of thyssenkrupp Elevator Corp., thyssenkrupp Aufzüge
GmbH, Tepper Aufzüge GmbH, thyssenkrupp Elevator (Canada) Limited and thyssenkrupp Elevator
Manufacturing Inc.; and

- security over substantially all assets (subject to customary exceptions) of the Post-Closing Guarantors
incorporated in the United States and Canada.

The Collateral will also secure the Senior Facilities on a pari passu basis and may also secure certain Hedging
Obligations, any Additional Notes as well as certain other future Indebtedness. A portion of the Collateral, the
Topco Shared Collateral (as defined under “Description of the Senior Notes”), will also secure the Senior Notes
and certain other future Indebtedness on a senior subordinated basis. In addition, under certain circumstances,
including a repayment in full of the amounts outstanding under the Senior Term Facilities, any Revolving
Facility (including the Original Revolving Facility) Incurred pursuant to sub-clause (i)(A)(3), and any Guarantee

227


-----

Facility (including the Original Guarantee Facility) Incurred pursuant to sub-clause (i)(A)(4), in each case of the
second paragraph of the covenant described under “Limitation on Indebtedness” below, may be re-designated as
a “super senior” obligation under the Intercreditor Agreement, and following such re-designation, Holders will
only receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral after the obligations thereunder (and certain super
senior Hedging Obligations) have been paid in full. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
Intercreditor Agreement” and “—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.”

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—
Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the Company and the
Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with future issuances
of Indebtedness or Indebtedness of the Restricted Subsidiaries, including, subject to certain requirements
described herein, Additional Notes, as permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Collateral (other than the Escrow Charge) will be granted to the Security Agent on behalf of the Holders and
holders of the other secured obligations that are secured by the Collateral pursuant to the Security Documents.
Any other assets subject to Security Interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations under the
Notes, any Note Guarantees and the Indenture would also constitute “Collateral.” All Collateral will be subject to
the limitations that are applicable to Note Guarantees granted by the same entity, the operation of the Agreed
Security Principles and any Permitted Collateral Liens.

The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the
Holders. No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with the offering of the Notes. By its
nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value.
Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. The proceeds from the
enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders. See “Risk
Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—The value of the Collateral securing the Notes may not be sufficient to
satisfy our obligations under the Notes and such Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain
circumstances.”

The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or imposed
by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent
conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital
maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other
considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations, see “Certain Insolvency Law
Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security
Interests.”

Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of the covenant described below under “—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” certain property, rights and assets may not be pledged, and any pledge over
property, rights and assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed Security
Principles. The following is a non-exhaustive summary of certain terms of the Agreed Security Principles, which
include, among others:

- general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance, anti-trust and other
competition authority restrictions, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, equitable subordination,
“transfer pricing”, “thin capitalization”, “earnings stripping”, “controlled foreign corporation” and other tax
restrictions, “exchange control restrictions”, “capital maintenance” rules and “liquidity impairment” rules,
tax restrictions, retention of title claims, employee consultation or approval requirements and similar
principles may limit the ability of a member of the Group to provide a guarantee or security or may require
that the guarantee or security be limited as to amount or otherwise and, if so, the guarantee or security will
be limited accordingly provided that, to the extent requested by the Security Agent before signing any
applicable security or accession document, the relevant member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavors
(but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to
overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or security document shall be subject to such limit;

- a key factor in determining whether or not (and the terms on which) a guarantee or security will be taken
(and in respect of the security, the extent of its perfection and/or registration) is the applicable time and cost
(including adverse effects on taxes, interest deductibility, stamp duty, registration costs and taxes, notarial
costs, translation costs and all applicable legal fees and adverse effects on the ability of the Group to obtain
or maintain local facilities or other financing arrangements, including any factoring or similar arrangement
in each case permitted under the Indenture) which will not be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the
secured parties of obtaining such guarantee or security;

228


-----

- members of the Group will not be required to give guarantees or enter into security documents if they are
not wholly owned by another member of the Group or if it is not within the legal capacity of the relevant
members of the Group or if it would conflict with the fiduciary or statutory duties of their officers or
contravene any applicable legal, regulatory or contractual prohibition or restriction or have the potential to
result in a material risk of personal or criminal liability for any officer of or for any member of the Group;
_provided that, to the extent requested by the Security Agent before signing any applicable security document_
or accession document, the relevant member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavors (but without
incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such
obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or security document shall be subject to such limit;

- guarantees and security will be limited so that the aggregate of notarial costs and all registration and like
taxes and duties relating to the provision of security will not exceed an amount to be agreed between the
Company and the Security Agent;

- where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of granting security
over the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such security, security will be granted over
the material assets only;

- it is expressly acknowledged that it may be either impossible or impractical to create security over certain
categories of assets in which event security will not be taken over such assets;

- any asset subject to a legal requirement, contract, lease, license, instrument, regulatory constraint (including
any agreement with any government or regulatory body) or other third party arrangement (other than
restrictions contained in the constitutional documents of a member of the Group or in any intra-Group loan
agreement), which may prevent or condition the asset from being charged, secured or being subject to the
applicable security document (including requiring a consent of any third party, supervisory board or works
council (or equivalent)) and any asset which, if subject to the applicable security document, would give a
third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations with respect to
any member of the Group in respect of the asset or require the relevant chargor to take any action materially
adverse to the interests of the Group or any member thereof, in each case will be excluded from a guarantee
or security document;

- the giving of a guarantee, the granting of security and the registration and/or the perfection of the security
granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the relevant member
of the Group to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course as otherwise permitted by the
Finance Documents (as defined in the section entitled “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
Intercreditor Agreement” above) (including dealing with the secured assets and all contractual
counterparties or amending, waiving or terminating (or allowing to lapse) any rights, benefits or obligations,
in each case prior to an Acceleration Event (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) which is continuing),
and any requirement under the Agreed Security Principles to seek consent of any person or take or not take
any other action shall be subject to the Agreed Security Principles;

- any security document will only be required to be notarized if required by law in order for the relevant
security to become effective or admissible in evidence;

- no guarantee or security will be required to be given by or over any acquired person or asset (and no consent
shall be required to be sought with respect thereto) which are required to support Acquired Indebtedness to
the extent such Acquired Indebtedness is permitted by the Indenture to remain outstanding after an
acquisition. No member of a target group or other entity acquired pursuant to an acquisition permitted by the
Indenture shall be required to become a Guarantor or grant security with respect to the Notes if prevented by
the terms of the documentation governing that acquired indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness or
any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of such Acquired Indebtedness) or if becoming a Guarantor or the
granting of any security would give rise to an obligation (including any payment obligation) under or in
relation thereto; no security will be granted over any asset secured for the benefit of any debt permitted by
the Indenture and/or to the extent constituting a Permitted Lien unless specifically required by a Finance
Document to the contrary;

- no title investigations or other diligence on assets will be required and no title insurance will be required;

- security will not be required over any assets subject to security in favor of a third party (other than in
relation to security under general business conditions of account banks which do not prohibit or prevent the
creation of security over such accounts) or any cash constituting regulatory capital or customer cash (and
such assets or cash shall be excluded from any relevant security document);

229


-----

- to the extent legally effective, all security will be given in favor of the Security Agent and not the secured
creditors individually (with the Security Agent to hold one set of security documents for all secured parties);
“parallel debt” provisions will be used where necessary (and included in the Intercreditor Agreement and
not the individual security documents); no member of the Group will be required to take any action in
relation to any guarantees or security as a result of any assignment or transfer by a secured party;

- guarantees and security will not be required from or over the assets of, any joint venture or similar
arrangement, any minority interest or any member of the Group that is not wholly-owned by another
member of the Group;

- each security document shall be deemed not to restrict or condition any transaction permitted under the
Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement and the security granted under each security document shall be
deemed to be subject to these Agreed Security Principles, before and after the execution of the relevant
security document and creation of the relevant security;

- no security may be provided on terms which are inconsistent with the turnover or sharing provisions in the
Intercreditor Agreement;

- the secured parties (or any agent or similar representative appointed by them at the relevant time) will not be
able to exercise any power of attorney or set-off granted to them under the terms of the Finance Documents
prior to the occurrence of an Acceleration Event which is continuing;

- no guarantee or security shall guarantee or secure any “Excluded Swap Obligations” defined in accordance
with the LSTA Market Advisory Update dated February 15, 2013 entitled “Swap Regulations’ Implications
for Loan Documentation”, and any update thereto by the LSTA;

- other than a general filing relating to a floating charge or blanket lien, no perfection, filing or other action
will be required with respect to assets of a type not owned by members of the Group or not in Australia,
Canada, any member state of the EU, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Switzerland, the
United Kingdom and the United States (including any state thereof and the District of Columbia) (each, a
“Guarantor Jurisdiction”) or otherwise over the shares of a member of the Group not located in a Guarantor
Jurisdiction;

- no translation of any document relating to any security or any asset subject to any security will be required
to be prepared or provided to the secured parties, unless (i) required for such documents to become effective
or admissible in evidence and (ii) an Acceleration Event is continuing; and

- no security shall be provided to the extent it would constitute or may constitute unlawful financial assistance
within the meaning of articles 143 or 150 (as applicable) of the Spanish Companies Act or any equivalent
provision of any other applicable law.

The Agreed Security Principles with respect to the Notes will be interpreted and applied in good faith by the
Company.

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the Security
Documents (the “Security Interests” and each, a “Security Interest”) as between (a) the lenders under the Senior
Facilities Agreement, (b) the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations, (c) the Trustee, the Security
Agent and the Holders under the Indenture, (d) the trustee, the Security Agent and the holders under the Private
Senior Notes Indenture, (e) the trustee, the Security Agent and the holders under the Public Senior Notes
Indenture and (f) the creditors of certain other Indebtedness (including Indebtedness that may be Incurred in the
future) permitted to be secured by such Collateral, respectively, will be established by the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, which will provide, among other things, that the obligations under the Senior Facilities
Agreement, the Notes and certain Hedging Obligations and the guarantees thereof are secured equally and ratably
by first-priority Security Interests in the Collateral. In addition, any Revolving Facility (including the Original
Revolving Facility) Incurred pursuant to sub-clause (i)(A)(3), and any Guarantee Facility (including the Original
Guarantee Facility) Incurred pursuant to sub-clause (i)(A)(4), in each case of the second paragraph of the
covenant described under “Limitation on Indebtedness” below, may be re-designated as a “super senior”
obligation under the Intercreditor Agreement, and following such re-designation, Holders will only receive
proceeds from the enforcement of, or certain distressed disposals of, the Collateral after the obligations
thereunder (and certain super senior Hedging Obligations) have been paid in full. The obligations under the
Senior Note Guarantees shall rank in right of priority and payment after liabilities owed, among others, under the
Senior Facilities, the Notes and certain Hedging Obligations secured by the Collateral, and obligations under the

230


-----

Senior Note Guarantees will be postponed and subordinated to, among others, obligations under the Senior
Facilities, the Notes and certain Hedging Obligations and any guarantees thereof. See “Description of Certain
Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.”

**_Security Documents_**

Under the Security Documents, the Issuers and the Guarantors will grant security over the Collateral to secure the
payment when due of the Company’s and the Guarantors’ payment obligations under the Notes, the Note
Guarantees and the Indenture. The Security Documents will be entered into by the relevant security provider and
the Security Agent as agent for the secured parties. When entering into such Security Documents, the Security
Agent will act in its own name, but for the benefit of the secured parties (including itself, the Trustee and the
Holders from time to time). Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent also acts as an agent of the
lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the holders of any Topco Notes and the counterparties under
certain Hedging Obligations in relation to the Security Interests created in favor of such parties.

In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of Security
Interests, the relevant Security Documents will secure “parallel debt” obligations created under the Intercreditor
Agreement in favor of the Security Agent (and not the obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees). The
parallel debt construct has not been fully tested under the law in certain of these jurisdictions. See “Risk
Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—The security interests in the Notes Collateral will be granted to the
Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the
Notes Collateral may be restricted by local law.”

Each Escrow Charge shall be granted solely for the benefit of the Trustee on behalf of the Holders of the
applicable series of Notes, and no other persons (including for the avoidance of doubt any lender under the
Senior Facilities Agreement, any holder of Senior Notes, counterparties under any Hedging Obligations or any
other creditors) shall be entitled to benefit from the Escrow Charges.

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, only
the Security Agent will have the right to enforce the Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee and the
Holders. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, Holders will not be entitled to take enforcement action
in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee under the Indenture, who will (subject
to the provisions of the Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent.

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Notes and the Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by Security Interests in the Collateral until
all obligations under the Notes and the Indenture have been discharged. However, the Security Interests with
respect to the Notes and the Indenture may be released under certain circumstances as provided under
“—Security—Release of Liens.”

In the event that the Company or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the
Security Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in the
Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the Security
Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement was successful, the Holders may not be able to recover any
amounts under the Security Documents. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—The granting of the
Guarantees and security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the incurrence of permitted
debt in the future, may create or restart hardening or voidance periods for such security interests in accordance
with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions.”

**_Enforcement of Security Interest_**

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will restrict the ability of the Holders or the Trustee to enforce the
Security Interests and provide for the release of the Security Interests created by the Security Documents in
certain circumstances upon enforcement by the Security Agent in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement. These limitations are described under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
Intercreditor Agreement” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests.” The ability to enforce may also be restricted by
similar arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral in compliance with the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The creditors under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Notes, the counterparties to Hedging Obligations
secured by the Collateral and the Trustee have and, by accepting a Note as described below, each Holder will be
deemed to have, appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the
security documents securing such Indebtedness.

231


-----

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**

The Indenture will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, will be deemed (without any further consent of
the Holders) to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents and perform
the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents securing such Indebtedness, together with any other
incidental rights, power and discretions;

(2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements and the Security Documents; and

(3) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and comply with
the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security
Documents (including the execution of, and compliance with, any waiver, modification, amendment,
renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Trustee or the Security Agent on its behalf).

See the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—The security interests in the Notes
Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the
Security Agent to enforce the Notes Collateral may be restricted by local law.”

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as
defined below) entered into in compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional
Intercreditor Agreements.”

**_Release of Liens_**

Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, release of the
Security Interests in respect of the Collateral will be permitted under any one or more of the following
circumstances:

(1) other than the Liens over the Capital Stock of the Company, in connection with any sale or other disposition
of Collateral to (a) a Person that is not the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any
transaction subject to “—Merger and Consolidation”), if such sale or other disposition does not violate the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” and
is otherwise not prohibited by the Indenture or (b) any Restricted Subsidiary; provided that this clause 1(b)
shall not be relied upon in the case of a transfer of Capital Stock or of accounts receivable (including
intercompany loan receivables and hedging receivables) to a Restricted Subsidiary (except to a
Securitization Subsidiary) unless the relevant property and assets remain subject to, or otherwise become
subject to, a Lien in favor of the Notes following such sale or disposal;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Note Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the
release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

(3) as described under “Amendments and Waivers” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or legal defeasance,
covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided in “Defeasance” and
“Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(5) if the Company designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such
Unrestricted Subsidiary, and the release of any assets designated by the Company as Receivables Assets in
connection with a Receivables Facility;

(6) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization; or

(7) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture.

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Security Documents will be released (a) in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) as may be permitted by the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.” For the avoidance of doubt, Liens in
respect of Specified Assets will be released in connection with a Specified Asset Disposition.

The Security Interests over the assets subject to the Escrow Charges will be released upon the occurrence of the
Escrow Release or in connection with the Special Mandatory Redemption.

232


-----

The Security Agent and the Trustee (but only if required) will take all necessary action reasonably requested by,
and at the cost of, the Company to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Notes and the Note
Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Document. Each of the releases set forth above shall be
effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee (unless
action is required by it to effect such release). The Security Agent and the Trustee shall be entitled to request and
rely solely upon an Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel, each certifying which circumstance, as
described above, giving rise to a release of the Security Interests has occurred, and that such release complies
with the Indenture; provided, however, that with respect to the release of the Security Interests over the assets
subject to the Escrow Charge, the Trustee shall be entitled to additionally receive (i) in connection with the
Escrow Release, an Officer’s Certificate (which may, at the Company’s option, be the Escrow Release Officer’s
Certificate) certifying satisfaction of the conditions for the Escrow Release and (ii) in connection with the Special
Mandatory Redemption, a notice of the Special Mandatory Redemption.

**IPO Debt Pushdown**

On or following a public equity offering (an “IPO Event”) (or in contemplation of an IPO Event with respect to
the release of security if required to implement such IPO Event), the Company shall be entitled to require (by
written notice to the Trustee (a “Pushdown Notice”)) that the terms of the Debt Documents shall operate (with
effect from the date specified in the relevant Pushdown Notice (the “Pushdown Date”)) on the basis that:

(i) references to the Company and Restricted Subsidiaries (and all related provisions) shall apply only to the
IPO Pushdown Entity and its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time;

(ii) all financial ratio calculations, basket calculations and financial definitions shall exclude any parent entity of
the IPO Pushdown Entity and all reporting obligations shall be assumed at the level of the IPO Pushdown
Entity;

(iii) each reference in the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement)
to the “Company” shall be deemed to be a reference to the IPO Pushdown Entity (to the extent applicable
and unless the context requires otherwise); and provided that nothing in this paragraph, including the
deeming construct contemplated by this sub-clause (iii) and any action taken by the IPO Pushdown Entity
prior to it being deemed to be the Company, shall, or shall be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or
result in a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking, covenant or other term in the Indenture, the
Senior Facilities Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the
other collateral documents or a Default or an Event of Default;

(iv) none of the representations, warranties, undertakings, covenants or Events of Default, as applicable, in the
Debt Documents shall apply to any entity of which the IPO Pushdown Entity is a Subsidiary (whether in its
capacity as a Guarantor in respect of the Notes or otherwise);

(v) no event, matter or circumstance relating to any Parent Entity of the IPO Pushdown Entity (whether in its
capacity as a Guarantor or otherwise) shall, or shall be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or result
in a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking, covenant or other term in the Debt Documents or a
Default or an Event of Default;

(vi) each Parent Entity of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released from all
obligations and restrictions under the Debt Documents and any security granted by any such Parent Entity;

(vii) each Parent Entity of the IPO Pushdown Entity will not, on the Pushdown Date after giving pro forma effect
thereto, have any assets (other than shares in its subsidiaries and intercompany receivables) that are material
to, or reasonably necessary for the operation of, the business of the Group;

(viii) unless otherwise notified by the Company: (A) each Person which is party to the Intercreditor Agreement
(or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as a “Subordinated Creditor,” “Third Party Security Provider,”
“Investor” or “Topco Independent Obligor” (as such terms are defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) (each
in such capacity, a “Released Person”) shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released from the
Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and all obligations and restrictions
under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (and from the date specified
by the Company, that Person shall cease to be party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) in the applicable capacity as a Released Person and shall have no further rights or
obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) in that capacity);
and (B) there shall be no obligation or requirement for any Person to become party to the Intercreditor
Agreement as a Released Person; and

233


-----

(ix) in the event that any Person is released from or ceases to be or become party to the Intercreditor Agreement
(or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as a Released Person as a consequence of this paragraph, any
term of the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) which
requires or assumes that any Person be a Released Person or that any liabilities or obligations to such Person
be subject to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or otherwise
subordinated shall cease to apply.

The Trustee, the Security Agent and any other agents party thereto shall be required to enter into any amendment
to, release of, or replacement of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or the other security documents
required by the Company and/or take such other action as is required by the Company in order to facilitate or
reflect any of the matters contemplated by the first paragraph of this covenant (collectively, an “IPO
_Pushdown”); provided, that such amendment, replacement or other document or instrument will not impose any_
personal obligations on the Trustee, the Security Agent and any other agents party thereto or adversely affect the
rights, duties, liabilities, indemnifications or immunities of the Trustee, the Security Agent or any other agents
party thereto under the Indenture, Intercreditor Agreement or Security Documents. The Trustee, the Security
Agent and any other agents party thereto are each irrevocably authorized and instructed by the Holders of the
Notes (without any consent by the Holders of the Notes) to execute any such amended, released or replacement
documents and/or take other such action on behalf of the Holders (and shall do so on the request of the
Company).

For the purpose of this covenant, the “IPO Pushdown Entity” shall be any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company
or a Parent Entity of the Company notified to the Trustee by the Company in writing as the Person to be treated
as the IPO Pushdown Entity in relation to the relevant IPO Event; provided, that the IPO Pushdown Entity shall
be a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company which is a Parent Entity of the Dollar Issuer and which will issue
shares, or whose shares are to be sold, pursuant to that IPO Event (or a parent entity of such Restricted
Subsidiary) and, provided further, that (a) if the Topco Notes are not refinanced in full on or before the
Pushdown Date, this section “IPO Debt Pushdown” shall operate such that (i) for the purposes of the Topco
Group (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) or Topco Liabilities (as defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement), the Topco Borrower (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) shall be the IPO Pushdown Entity
as determined by the first clause of this paragraph and the Topco Group (and all related provisions) shall
comprise that IPO Pushdown Entity and its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time; and (ii) for the purposes of
the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries or Liabilities (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) other than
the Topco Liabilities (and all related provisions) references to the “IPO Pushdown Entity” shall be construed as
reference to the direct Subsidiary of the IPO Pushdown Entity as determined by the first clause of this paragraph
and its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time; or (b) if the Topco Notes have been refinanced in full on or
before the Pushdown Date but the Notes have not been refinanced in full on or before the Pushdown Date, the
Company shall be the IPO Pushdown Entity and the Group (and all related provisions) shall continue to comprise
the Company and its Subsidiaries from time to time.

If the Company delivers a Pushdown Notice to the Trustee pursuant to the first paragraph of this section “IPO
Debt Pushdown” in relation to a contemplated IPO Event, it shall be entitled to revoke that Pushdown Notice at
any time prior to the occurrence of the relevant IPO Event by written notice to the Trustee. In the event that any
Pushdown Notice is revoked in accordance with this paragraph: (i) the provisions of clauses (i) to (vii) of the first
paragraph of this covenant shall cease to apply in relation to that Pushdown Notice; (ii) if any security has been
released pursuant to the foregoing paragraphs in reliance on that Pushdown Notice, subject to the Agreed
Security Principles, the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary will as soon as reasonably practicable
execute a replacement Security Document in respect of that security; and (iii) if any Person party to the
Intercreditor Agreement in the capacity of a Released Person has been released from the Intercreditor Agreement
pursuant to clauses (vi) or (vii) of the first paragraph or the third paragraph of this covenant in reliance on that
Pushdown Notice, that Person shall as soon as reasonably practicable accede to the Intercreditor Agreement as
the applicable Released Person. For the avoidance of doubt: (A) nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit or
otherwise restrict the Company from delivering a further Pushdown Notice in relation to any actual or
contemplated IPO Event; and (B) revocation of a Pushdown Notice shall not, and shall not be deemed to, directly
or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking or other term in the
Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or a Default or an Event of Default (whether by reason of any action or
step taken by any Person, or any matter or circumstance arising or committed, while that Pushdown Notice was
effective or otherwise).

_Other Redemptions Terms_

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for any series of Notes, including a Change of
Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes of such series validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the
applicable Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of such Issuer, purchases all of the Notes
validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the applicable Issuer or such third party will have the right
upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase
date, to redeem all Notes of such series, in whole or in part, that remain outstanding following such purchase at a
price equal to the price offered to each other Holder (excluding any early tender or incentive fee) in such tender
offer plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the date of such redemption. Without prejudice to any provision of
the Indenture regarding Notes deemed not be outstanding for voting purposes if held by the Company or its
Affiliates, in determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes of a series have validly tendered and not validly withdrawn Notes in a tender offer, including a
Change of Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, Notes owned by an Affiliate of the Company or by funds
controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the Company, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be
outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer and such determination.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below.

236


-----

Notice of any redemption (other than a Special Mandatory Redemption) of the Notes may, at the applicable
Issuer’s discretion, be given prior to the completion of a transaction (including an Equity Offering, an incurrence
of Indebtedness, a Change of Control, an Asset Disposition or other transaction) and any redemption notice may,
at the applicable Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to,
completion of a related transaction. If such redemption or purchase is so subject to satisfaction of one or more
conditions precedent, such notice shall describe each such condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the
Company’s or the applicable Issuer’s discretion, the redemption or repurchase date may be delayed until such
time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption or offer to purchase was sent) as any or
all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the Company or the applicable Issuer in their sole discretion),
or such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such
conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived by the Company or the applicable Issuer in their sole
discretion) by the redemption or purchase date, or by the redemption or purchase date as so delayed, or that such
notice may be rescinded at any time in the Company’s or the applicable Issuer’s sole discretion if the Company
or the applicable Issuer determines that any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied or waived. In addition,
the Company or the applicable Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption or purchase
price and performance of the Company’s or the applicable Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption
may be performed by another Person.

The Issuers may redeem Notes pursuant to one or more of the relevant provisions in the Indenture, and a single
notice of redemption may be delivered with respect to redemptions made pursuant to different provisions. Any
such notice may provide that redemptions made pursuant to different provisions will have different redemption
dates.

If the optional redemption date is on or after a record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment
date, the accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date will be paid on the redemption
date to the Holder in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date in accordance
with the applicable procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, and no additional interest will be payable to
Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by an Issuer.

Unless the applicable Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the
Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

**Mandatory Redemption or Sinking Fund**

Except as described under the caption “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,” the Issuers are
not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.
However, under certain circumstances, the Issuers may be required to offer to purchase Notes as described under
“—Change of Control” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitations on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock.” As
market conditions warrant, we and our equity holders, including the Permitted Holders, their respective Affiliates
and members of our management, may from time to time seek to purchase our outstanding debt securities or
loans, including the Notes or derivative instruments related thereto, in privately negotiated or open market
transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Subject to any applicable limitations contained in the agreements
governing our indebtedness, including the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, any purchases made by us may be funded by the use of cash on our balance sheet or the
incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt, including borrowings under our credit facilities. The amounts
involved in any such purchase transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Any such
purchases may be with respect to a substantial amount of a particular class or series of debt, with the attendant
reduction in the trading liquidity of such class or series. In addition, any such purchases of Dollar Fixed Rate
Notes made at prices below the “adjusted issue price” (as defined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) may
result in taxable cancellation of indebtedness income to us, which amounts may be material, and in related
adverse tax consequences to us.

**Selection and Notice**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount
received by them in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection
with the redemption of such Book Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof).

Under the existing practices of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Euro Fixed Rate Notes,
the Euro FRN Notes or the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes, as applicable, are to be redeemed at any time, DTC,

237


-----

Euroclear or Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a pro rata basis (such as by way of
a pool factor), by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate and in accordance with the
applicable procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream; provided, however, that no Book Entry Interest of less
than €100,000 principal amount with respect to Euro Notes and less than $200,000 principal amount with respect
to Dollar Fixed Rate Notes may be redeemed in part. If the Notes are not held through DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream, the Notes will be selected on a pro rata basis, subject to adjustments so that no Note in an
unauthorized denomination remains outstanding after such redemption; provided, however, no such partial
redemption shall reduce the outstanding principal amount of any Euro Notes below €100,000 or of any Dollar
Fixed Rate Notes below $100,000. The Trustee, the Paying Agents and the Registrar shall not be liable for
selections made under this paragraph.

Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at least 10
days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at the address
of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of
DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, except that redemption notices may be delivered electronically or mailed more
than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a legal or covenant defeasance
of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture.

If and for so long as any Notes are listed on the Exchange and if and to the extent the rules of the Exchange so
require, the Issuers will notify the Exchange of any such notice to the Holders of the Notes and, in connection
with any redemption, the Issuers will notify the Exchange of any change in the principal amount of Notes
outstanding.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the portion
of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case a portion of the original Note will be issued in the
name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. In the case of a global note, an appropriate
notation will be made on such Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the
unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice (including any conditions
contained therein), Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the
redemption date, unless the applicable Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest ceases to
accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption.

Except as otherwise required under the Indenture, the Issuers may elect to redeem or repurchase one or more
series of Notes or a portion of a series of Notes without redeeming any other series of Notes.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Euro Issuer or the Dollar Issuer may redeem the Euro Notes or the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes in whole, but not
in part, at any time at its discretion upon giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice to the
Holders (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof,
together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax
_Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on_
the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts, as defined below under “Withholding Taxes,” if
any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise,
if the applicable Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations, official guidance or rulings
promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below under “—Withholding
Taxes”) affecting taxation; or

(2) any amendment to, or change in an official application, administration or written interpretation of such laws,
treaties, regulations, official guidance or rulings (including by reason of a holding, judgment or order by a
court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) (each of the foregoing in
clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

a Payor (as defined below under “—Withholding Taxes”) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the
applicable series of Notes would be, required to pay Additional Amounts (or increased Additional Amounts) with
respect to the applicable series of Notes (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such
requirement cannot be made by the Issuers or another Guarantor who can make such payment without the
obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures
available to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this
would be reasonable). Such Change in Tax Law must be formally announced and become effective on or after
the Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date

238


-----

after the Issue Date, such later date). The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time
as such Guarantor is obliged to make at least one payment on the Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any
successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax
Law occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under
“Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given earlier than
60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of Additional
Amounts. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the
applicable Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such
redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right to so redeem
have been satisfied and that the obligation to pay Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the relevant Payor
taking reasonable measures available to it (but in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such
requirement cannot be made by the Issuers or another Guarantor who can make such payment without the
obligation to pay Additional Amounts) and (b) a written opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized
standing qualified under the laws of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and satisfactory to the Trustee (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld) to the effect that the Payor has been or will become obligated to pay
Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely
conclusively on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions
precedent described above, without liability or further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding
on the Holders.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of any Issuer or any Guarantor (including any successor entity) (each, a
“Payor”) in respect of the Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee, as applicable, will be made free and clear
of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of
such Taxes is then required by law or by the relevant taxing authority’s interpretation or administration thereof. If
any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or Note Guarantee is made by or on
behalf of any Payor or the Paying Agent or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or
therein having the power to tax (including the jurisdiction of the Paying Agent); or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes,
or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental
authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing
_Jurisdiction”),_

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor or the
Paying Agent with respect to any Note or any Note Guarantee, including (without limitation) payments of
principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such
additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in
respect of such payments, after such withholding or deduction (including any such withholding or deduction
from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been received in respect of
such payments on any such Note or Note Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided,
_however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:_

(1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or
former connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member,
partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an estate,
nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
(including, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a
business or maintaining a permanent establishment in or place of management present in, or being
physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising
solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise
or enforcement of rights under such Note, the Indenture or a Note Guarantee;

(2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the
beneficial owner of the Note to comply with a reasonable written request of the Payor addressed to the
Holder or beneficial owner, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such withholding or
deduction would be payable), to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning

239


-----

the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or
similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a law,
statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to
exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, all or part of such Tax, but, in each case, only to the extent the
Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to do so;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed as a result of the presentation of the Note for payment
(where Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and presentation is required) more than 30 days
after the later of the applicable payment date or the date the relevant payment is first made available for
payment to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts
had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period);

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment with respect to the
Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(6) any Taxes imposed, deducted or withheld pursuant to section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the “Code”) or otherwise imposed pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code,
in each case, as of the Issue Date (and any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable),
any current or future regulations or agreements thereunder, official interpretations thereof or similar law or
regulation implementing an intergovernmental agreement relating thereto;

(7) any U.S. federal back-up withholding tax under section 3406 of the Code;

(8) any U.S. federal withholding taxes imposed, deducted or withheld by reason of the Holder of the Dollar
Fixed Rate Notes (or the beneficial owner for whose benefit such Holder holds such Dollar Fixed Rate
Notes, or a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of such Holder if such Holder is an estate,
trust, partnership, or corporation, or a person holding a power over an estate or trust administered by a
fiduciary Holder of such Notes) being or having been a “10-percent shareholder” of the Dollar Issuer as
defined in section 871(h)(3) of the Code or any successor provision;

(9) any U.S. federal withholding taxes that would not have been imposed or withheld but for the beneficial
owner being a bank purchasing the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes in the ordinary course of its lending business
within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code or any successor provision; or

(10) any combination of the items (1) through (9) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or
any Person other than the beneficial owner of the Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settler with respect
to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to
Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner held such Notes directly.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the relevant tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will provide certified copies
of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of such other
reasonable evidence as is available of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee (with a
copy to the Paying Agent). Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will
be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment made on any Note or any Note
Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying
Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated
to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts on
the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the
relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable
after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to
conclusively rely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” there is mentioned, in any
context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of the Notes;

240


-----

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Note Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context,
Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay and reimburse each applicable Holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration,
court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect
thereto) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest
or penalties with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, issuance,
delivery, registration, enforcement of, or receipt of payments with respect to any Notes, any Note Guarantee, the
Indenture, or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (in each case, other than in connection with a
transfer after this offering) and limited, solely to the extent of such taxes or similar charges or levies that arise
from the receipt of any payments of principal or interest on the Notes, to any such taxes or similar charges or
levies that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (3) and (5) through (10) (save that in respect of clause (5),
this proviso shall not apply in connection with transfer, personal property or similar Taxes).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any transfer by
a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a
Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes,
or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to the Notes (or any Note
Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such successor Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or
agency thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless (i) a third party makes a Change of Control
Offer or (ii) the Issuers have previously or substantially concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice
with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described in the seventh paragraph under this heading “—Change of
Control,” the Issuers will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes (provided that Euro Notes of €100,000 or
less in principal amount, and Dollar Fixed Rate Notes of $200,000 or less in principal amount, may only be
redeemed in whole and not in part) pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a
price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the date of repurchase; provided that if the repurchase date is on or
after the record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment date, then Holders in whose name the
Notes are registered at the close of business on such record date will receive interest on the repurchase date.
Within 60 days following any Change of Control, the Issuers will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such
Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes at the address of such
Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC,
Euroclear and Clearstream, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and
offering to repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date
will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the
procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of
Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control as described below.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuers will comply with the applicable securities
laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by
virtue thereof. The Issuers may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the
SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that
permit the Holders to require that the Issuers repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover,
recapitalization or similar transaction.

The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control may constitute a default under the Senior
Facilities Agreement that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder and trigger the
Change of Control offer requirement under the Senior Notes Indentures and other financing arrangements of a
Parent Entity. Future Indebtedness of the Issuers or the Company’s subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on
certain events which would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a
Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuers to repurchase the

241


-----

Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the
financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuers. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be
available when necessary to make any required repurchases.

The Issuers’ ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be
limited by their then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when
necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain
circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent
management.

Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuers could, in the future, enter into certain transactions,
including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control
under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise
affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are
contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the
Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in
such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders
protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.

The Issuers will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i) a third
party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuers and
purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of
redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described under “—Optional
Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable
redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in
the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of
Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of
case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under
applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a
particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and
whether a Holder of Notes may require the Issuers to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuers’ obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as
a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority
in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules
of the Exchange so require, the Issuers will notify the Exchange of any Change of Control Offer.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that will be contained in the Indenture. For the avoidance of
doubt, the consummation of the Transactions shall not be prohibited by the covenants below under “—Certain
Covenants.”

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

Following the first day:

(a) a series of Notes has achieved Investment Grade Status; and

(b) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture,

(the occurrence of such events, a “Covenant Suspension Event” and the date thereof being referred to as the
“Suspension Date”), then, beginning on the Suspension Date until the occurrence of the Reversion Date (as
defined below), (i) the amount of each basket set by reference to a monetary amount for which a specific amount
is set out in the Indenture and any definitions used therein (including all “annual,” “life of facilities”, “fiscal
year”, “financial year”, “calendar year”, “at any time” and “aggregate” baskets) shall be increased by fifty

242


-----

(50) per cent and (ii) the covenants specifically listed under the following captions in this offering memorandum
will no longer be applicable to the Notes (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”):

- “—Limitation on Indebtedness;”

- “—Limitation on Restricted Payments;”

- “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock;”

- “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions;”

- the provisions of clause (iv) under “Merger and Consolidation—Company;”

- the provisions of clause (iv) under “Merger and Consolidation—Dollar Issuer;”

- “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries;”

- “—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries;” and

- “—Impairment of Security Interest.”

During any period that the foregoing covenants have been suspended, the Company may not designate any of its
Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. If and while the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not
subject to the Suspended Covenants, the Notes will be entitled to substantially less covenant protection. In the
event that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants under the
Indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”)
the Notes no longer have an Investment Grade Rating or a Rating Agency withdraws its Investment Grade Rating
or downgrades the rating assigned to the relevant series of Notes below an Investment Grade Rating (in each
case, to the extent given an Investment Grade Rating by such Rating Agency), then the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture with
respect to future events. The period of time between the Suspension Date and the Reversion Date is referred to in
this description as the “Suspension Period.” The Note Guarantees (other than the Note Guarantee of the
Company in respect of the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes) will be suspended during the Suspension Period.
Additionally, upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event, the amount of Excess Proceeds from any
Asset Dispositions shall be reset to zero.

During the Suspension Period, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be entitled to incur Liens to the
extent provided for under “—Limitation on Liens” (including, without limitation, Permitted Liens) and any
Permitted Liens which may refer to one or more Suspended Covenants shall be interpreted as though such
applicable Suspended Covenant(s) continued to be applicable during the Suspension Period (but solely for
purposes of the “—Limitation on Liens” covenant and the “Permitted Liens” and “Permitted Collateral Liens”
definitions and for no other covenant).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any such reinstatement, no action taken or omitted to be taken by
the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries prior to such reinstatement will give rise to a Default or Event
of Default under the Indenture, and no Default or Event of Default will be deemed to exist or have occurred as a
result of any failure by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to comply with any of the Suspended
Covenants during the Suspension Period; provided, that (1) with respect to Restricted Payments (as defined
herein) made after such reinstatement, the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments will be calculated
as though the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect
prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period (including with respect to a Applicable Transaction entered into
during the Suspension Period); (2) all Indebtedness incurred, committed or issued during the Suspension Period
(or deemed incurred or issued in connection with an Applicable Transaction entered into during the Suspension
Period) will be classified to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (iv)(A) of the second paragraph of
“—Limitation on Indebtedness;” (3) any Affiliate Transaction (as defined herein) entered into after such
reinstatement pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be
permitted pursuant to clause (vi) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
Affiliate Transactions;” (4) any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not
the Dollar Issuer or a Guarantor to take any action described in clauses (i) through (iii) of the first paragraph of
the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” that
becomes effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (i) of the
second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted
Subsidiaries;” (5) no Subsidiary of the Company shall be required to comply with the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries” after such reinstatement with respect to
any guarantee or obligation entered into by such Subsidiary during any Suspension Period; and (6) all

243


-----

Investments made during the Suspension Period (or deemed made in connection with an Applicable Transaction
entered into during the Suspension Period) will be classified to have been made under clause (i) of the definition
of “Permitted Investments.”

Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated after the Reversion Date, (1) no Default, Event
of Default or breach of any kind will be deemed to exist under the Indenture, the Notes or the Note Guarantees
with respect to the Suspended Covenants, and none of Midco or any of its Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for
any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period, or any actions taken at any time pursuant to
any contractual obligation arising during any Suspension Period, in each case as a result of a failure to comply
with the Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period (or, upon termination of the Suspension Period or
after that time based solely on any action taken or event that occurred during the Suspension Period), and
(2) following a Reversion Date, the Company and each Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted, without causing
a Default or Event of Default, to honor, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments or
obligations arising during any Suspension Period and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.

There can be no assurance that any series of Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Rating.
The Trustee shall be notified of a Covenant Suspension Event. The Trustee shall have no duty to (i) monitor the
ratings of the Notes, (ii) ascertain whether a Covenant Suspension Event or Reversion Date have occurred, or
(iii) notify the Holders of any of the foregoing.

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness); provided that the Company and any of the Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur
Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), if on the Applicable Test Date and after giving pro forma effect
thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), either: (i) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is
at least 2.00:1.00 or (ii) the Total Net Leverage Ratio does not exceed 6.85:1.00.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness (collectively,
“Permitted Debt”):

Facility (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit, guarantees and bankers’ acceptances thereunder)

(D) the maximum amount of Indebtedness secured on the Collateral that is not Senior Secured
Indebtedness such that, on the Applicable Test Date after giving pro forma effect to such Incurrence,

_provided that any Indebtedness or unutilized commitments in respect of Indebtedness Incurred or deemed to_
be Incurred pursuant to this clause (i) may be refinanced at any time if such refinancing does not exceed the
greater of (1) the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred pursuant to this
clause (i) on the Applicable Test Date for such refinancing and (2) the aggregate principal amount of the
Indebtedness or unutilized commitments in respect of Indebtedness being refinanced at such time (together
with an amount necessary to pay accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and expenses (including original
issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees), including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees,
discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred or payable in connection with such refinancing)
and, in the case of a refinancing of Indebtedness under Facility B (EUR), Facility A, Facility B (USD), the
Original Revolving Facility, the Original Guarantee Facility or any additional facilities under the Senior
Facilities Agreement Incurred as at the Acquisition Closing Date, such Indebtedness shall be treated for all
purposes as Incurred pursuant to clause (A)(1), (A)(2), (A)(3) and (A)(4) above, respectively;

(ii) any (A) Guarantees by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness or other obligations of the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and (B) without limiting the covenant set out under “—Limitation on

(25) per cent. of LTM EBITDA as of the Applicable Test Date; plus

(B) unlimited additional Indebtedness to the extent that:

(1) after giving effect to such acquisition (including an acquisition of any assets), merger,

(I) if such Indebtedness is Senior Secured Indebtedness, either (x) the Company would be
permitted to Incur at least €1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to clause (i)(C) of this
paragraph or (y) the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio would not increase as a result;

(II) if such Indebtedness constitutes Indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral but is not

owning such assets, and any Indebtedness which refinances, replaces or refunds such Indebtedness
either:

(1) Incurred in the ordinary course of business; or otherwise

(2) in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with any Refinancing

For purposes of determining compliance with, and without prejudice to the section “Financial Calculations,” and
the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, and in compliance with,
this covenant:

(i) subject to clause (ii) below, in the event that all or any portion of any item of Indebtedness (or any portion

pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Company, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may
from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and will only be required to include, in any manner
that complies with this covenant, the amount and type of such Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) in the
first paragraph of this covenant or one of the clauses of the second paragraph of this covenant, and

and the Company shall not be permitted to reclassify all or a portion of such Indebtedness;

(iii) for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness Incurred under a
Credit Facility, re-borrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to a “cash sweep” or “clean down”
provisions or any similar provisions under a Credit Facility that provide that Indebtedness is deemed to have
been repaid periodically shall only be deemed for the purposes of this covenant to have been Incurred on the
date such Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on the date of any subsequent re-borrowing thereof;

(iv) in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, when measuring the outstanding amount of such Indebtedness,
such amount shall not include any amounts necessary to pay the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid
interest and any fees and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees), including
any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses
Incurred or payable in connection with such refinancing;

(v) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments
relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular
amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(vi) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred
pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to the first or the second paragraph

Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

(vii) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred
Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or
repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation
preference thereof;

(viii) in the event that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments under a
revolving credit facility, enters into any commitment to Incur or issue Indebtedness or commits to Incur any
Lien pursuant to clause (cc) of the definition of “Permitted Liens,” the Incurrence or issuance thereof for all
purposes under the Indenture, including for the purposes of calculating any Applicable Metric for
borrowings and reborrowings thereunder (and including issuance and creation of letters of credit and
bankers’ acceptances thereunder) may be determined, at the Company’s option (A) on the date of such
revolving credit facility or such entry into or increase in commitments or (B) on the date on which such
facility or commitments become available or, if applicable, any other Applicable Test Date (assuming, in the
case of (A) and (B) of this clause (viii) that the full amount thereof (or, at the option of the Company, a
portion thereof) has been borrowed as of such date) and, in either case, if any such Applicable Metric is
satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any borrowing or reborrowing thereunder (and the issuance and
creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant
irrespective of the Applicable Metric at the time of any borrowing or reborrowing (or issuance or creation of
letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the committed amount permitted to be borrowed or
reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances) on a date pursuant
to the operation of this clause (viii) but not actually borrowed on such date shall be the “Reserved
_Indebtedness Amount” as of such date for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Senior Secured_
Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable,
and, to the extent of any clause of the second paragraph of this covenant (if any), shall be deemed to be
Incurred and outstanding under such clauses);

(ix) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to
refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on the first paragraph of this covenant or any clause of
the second paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a percentage of LTM EBITDA as of the
Applicable Test Date, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction to be
exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of LTM EBITDA on the Applicable Test Date of such
refinancing, such percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the
principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such
Indebtedness being refinanced, plus the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and
expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees), including any premium and
defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred or payable in
connection with such refinancing; and

(x) except as otherwise specified herein, the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the
principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the
basis of IFRS.

Accrual and/or capitalization of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or
amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the
payment of dividends in the form of additional shares or Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the
reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS, will not be
deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this covenant; provided
that the amount of any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of any outstanding Indebtedness may (in the
Company’s sole discretion) be increased by the amount of all such accrued and/or capitalized interest, accreted
value, original issue discount and/or additional Indebtedness in respect of such Indebtedness and such Increased
Amount will not be deemed to be Indebtedness for the purpose of calculating any basket, permission or threshold
under which such Refinancing Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary
shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not
permitted to be Incurred as of such date under this covenant, the Company shall be in default of this covenant).

For the purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness or liquidation preference of
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant
currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred, or, at the option of the Company,
first committed or first incurred or upon execution of the definitive documentation in respect thereof (whichever
yields the lower Euro Equivalent); provided that, if such determination is made with respect to Indebtedness
Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause
the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in
effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been
exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (x) the principal
amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (y) the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid interest and
any fees and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees), including any premium
and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred or payable in
connection with such refinancing.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company
or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a
result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to
refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be
calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing
Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

same fiscal unity (steuerliche Organschaft) for German corporate income tax and trade tax purposes;
_provided that:_

(A) where payments under a German fiscal unity are required to be made by any Parent Entity to cover
Taxes on a consolidated basis on behalf of the Group, a tax distribution shall be made in cash to such
Parent Entity in accordance with the definition of Permitted Tax Distribution; and

(B) the remainder of such tax distribution in excess of the amount permitted pursuant to clause (A) above
shall not be paid to such Parent Entity in cash but instead be converted into an intercompany loan made
by such Parent Entity to the Company which constitutes Subordinated Liabilities (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement), save to the extent otherwise agreed by the Agent.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a Restricted Payment (or portion
thereof) (i) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Payments described in the second
paragraph of this covenant, and/or (ii) is permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and/or
(iii) constitutes a Permitted Investment, the Company will be entitled to classify such Restricted Payment or
Investment (or portion thereof) on the date of its payment or later reclassify (based on circumstances existing on
the date of such reclassification) such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) in any manner that
complies with this covenant, including as a Permitted Investment.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the Applicable Test
Date of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value of any cash
Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted Payment,
property or assets other than cash shall be determined conclusively by the Company acting in good faith.

Unrestricted Subsidiaries may use value transferred from the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries in a
Permitted Investment or a Restricted Investment not prohibited under this covenant to purchase or otherwise
acquire Indebtedness or Capital Stock of the Company, any Parent Entity or any of the Company’s Restricted
Subsidiaries, and to transfer value to the holders of the Capital Stock or any Parent Entity and to Affiliates
thereof, and such purchase, acquisition, or transfer will not be deemed to be a “direct or indirect” action by the
Company or the Restricted Subsidiaries.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Company will not, and the Company will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly,
create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Company), whether owned on the Acquisition Closing Date or acquired after that date, or any
interest therein or any income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the
“Initial Lien”), except:

(i) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral:

(A) Permitted Liens; or

(B) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if obligations under the Notes and the Indenture
are directly secured equally and ratably with, or prior to, in the case of Liens with respect to
Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such
Indebtedness is so secured; and

(ii) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any Lien created in favor of the Notes pursuant to sub-clause (i)(B) of the first paragraph of this covenant will be
automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to
which it relates and (ii) otherwise as set forth in the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and/or under the
relevant Security Document.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of the
Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms,
accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of
property securing Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Disposition
unless:

(i) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including by way of
relief from, or by any other person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) at
least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be determined on the date of contractually
agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined in good faith by the Company, of the shares and assets
subject to such Asset Disposition (including, for the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a
Permitted Asset Swap);

(ii) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions, with a purchase price in excess of the
greater of (x) €265 million and (y) an amount equal to twenty (20) per cent. of LTM EBITDA, except in the
case of a Permitted Asset Swap, at least seventy-five (75) per cent. of the consideration for such Asset
Disposition, together with all other Asset Dispositions since the Acquisition Closing Date (on a cumulative
basis), received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of Cash
Equivalent Investments; and provided that the amount of:

(A) the greater of the principal amount and the carrying value of any liabilities (as reflected on the
Company’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent consolidated balance sheet or in the footnotes
thereto or, if Incurred or increased subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, such liabilities that
would have been reflected on the Company’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s consolidated balance
sheet or in the footnotes thereto if such incurrence or increase had taken place on or prior to the date of
such balance sheet, as determined by the Company) of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary,
other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes, that are (1) assumed by the
transferee of any such assets (or a third party in connection with such transfer) pursuant to a written
agreement which releases or indemnifies the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from such
liabilities or (2) otherwise cancelled or terminated in connection with the transaction;

(B) any securities, notes or other obligations or assets received by the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted or reasonably expected by the Company acting in
good faith to be converted by Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into Cash Equivalent
Investments (to the extent of the Cash Equivalent Investments received or expected to be received) or
by their terms are required to be satisfied for Cash Equivalent Investments within one hundred and
eighty (180) days following the closing of such Asset Disposition; and

(C) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary in
such Asset Disposition having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated
Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (C) that is at that time outstanding, not to
exceed the greater of (x) €331 million and (y) an amount equal to twenty-five (25) per cent. of LTM
EBITDA at the time of the receipt of such Designated Non-Cash Consideration (or, at the Company’s
option, at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition), with the fair market value of
each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without
giving effect to subsequent changes in value,

shall each be deemed to be Cash Equivalent Investments for purposes of this provision and for no other
purpose;

(iii) an amount equal to one hundred (100) per cent. of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is
applied, to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (at its sole
discretion):

(A) to prepay, repay or purchase:

(1) any Senior Secured Indebtedness; and/or

(2) any other Permitted Debt (provided that such application would comply with the covenant
described under “Limitation on Restricted Payments”),

(in each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary);

(B) to invest in or commit to invest in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in
Additional Assets by a Restricted Subsidiary equal to the amount of Net Available Cash received by
the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary); and/or

259


-----

(C) to make any Restricted Payment or Permitted Payment permitted to be made under the covenant
described under “Limitation on Restricted Payments” or any Permitted Investment,

in each case, within five hundred and forty-five (545) days from the later of (1) the date of such Asset
Disposition and (2) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided that:

(1) in connection with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to sub-clause
(iii)(A) above, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will
cause the related commitment (if any) (other than in the case of any asset-based credit facility, any
revolving credit facility (including a Revolving Facility) or a Guarantee Facility) to be reduced in
an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased;

(2) a binding commitment or letter of intent entered into not later than such 545th day shall be treated
as a permitted application of the Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment or letter of
intent so long as the Company, or such Restricted Subsidiary, enters into such commitment or
letter of intent with the good faith expectation that such Net Available Cash will be applied to
satisfy such commitment or letter of intent within the later of such 545th day and one hundred and
eighty (180) days of such commitment or letter of intent (an “Acceptable Commitment”) or, in the
event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before the Net
Available Cash is applied in connection therewith, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary
enters into another Acceptable Commitment (a “Second Commitment”) within one hundred and
eighty (180) days of such cancellation or termination; provided further that if any Second
Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Net Available Cash is
applied, then such Net Available Cash shall constitute Excess Proceeds; and

(3) pending the final application of the amount of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with
sub-clauses (iii)(A) to (iii)(C) above, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries may
temporarily reduce Indebtedness or otherwise use such Net Available Cash in any manner
permitted by the Indenture.

The following amount of Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or
committed to be applied or invested as provided in the first paragraph of this covenant will be deemed to
constitute “Excess Proceeds” under the Indenture:

(i) if the Total Net Leverage Ratio as at the Applicable Test Date in respect of the relevant Asset Disposition
exceeds 6.00:1.00, one hundred (100) per cent of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition; or

(ii) if the Total Net Leverage Ratio as at the Applicable Test Date in respect of the relevant Asset Disposition
exceeds 5.75:1.00 but does not exceed 6.00:1.00, fifty (50) per cent. of the Net Available Cash from such
Asset Disposition; or

(iii) if the Total Net Leverage Ratio as at the Applicable Test Date in respect of the relevant Asset Disposition
does not exceed 5.75:1.00, zero (0) per cent of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition;

in each case, provided that:

(A) to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary has elected to prepay, repay or purchase any amount
of Notes or other Senior Secured Indebtedness (other than the Notes) at a price of no less than one hundred
(100) per cent. of the principal amount thereof, and has extended such offer to the Holders of the Notes on at
least a pari passu basis to the extent the creditors in respect of such Senior Secured Indebtedness (including
the Holders) elect not to tender their Senior Secured Indebtedness for such prepayment, repayment or
purchase, the Company will be deemed to have applied an amount of Net Available Cash equal to such
amount not tendered under this clause (A), and such amount shall not increase the amount of Excess
Proceeds (such amount, together with the aggregate amount described under the fourth paragraph of this
covenant, the “Declined Proceeds”); and

(B) for the avoidance of doubt, Net Available Cash that will not constitute Excess Proceeds pursuant to clause
(ii) or (iii) of this paragraph above shall be immediately available to the Group for any purposes permitted
by the Indenture, including to make Restricted Payments in accordance with clause (xxvi) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “Limitation on Restricted Payments,” without regard to the
periods specified in clause (iii) of the first paragraph of this covenant.

On the 546th day (or such longer period permitted by the first paragraph of this covenant) after the later of an
Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds under
this covenant exceeds the greater of (x) €397 million and (y) an amount equal to thirty (30) per cent. of LTM

260


-----

EBITDA in a single transaction, the Company will within ten (10) Business Days make an offer (an “Asset
_Disposition Offer”) to all Holders of the Notes and, if required or permitted by the terms of any other Senior_
Secured Indebtedness, to the holders of such Senior Secured Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum aggregate
principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Notes and such Senior Secured Indebtedness that may
be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to (i) in the case of the
Notes, 100% of the principal amount thereof (or accreted value, if less), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
to the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture, and
(ii) in the case of such other Senior Secured Indebtedness, the offer price required by the terms thereof, in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the agreement(s) governing such Senior Secured Indebtedness.

The Company may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Available Cash from an Asset
Disposition by making an Asset Disposition Offer with respect to such Net Available Cash prior to the expiration
of the relevant five hundred and forty-five (545) days (or such longer period provided above) (the “Asset
_Disposition Offer Period”) with respect to all or part of the Net Available Cash (the “Advance Portion”) in_
advance of being required to do so by the Indenture (an “Advance Offer”).

If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes and other Senior Secured
Indebtedness, as the case may be, surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the amount offered in the Asset
Disposition Offer (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Company shall prepay, repay or
purchase the Notes and such Senior Secured Indebtedness, as the case may be, on a pro rata basis based on the
aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of the Notes or such Senior Secured Indebtedness,
as the case may be, tendered with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes or Senior Secured Indebtedness, as
the case may be, will be repurchased in part in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any such
Asset Disposition Offer (or Advance Offer), the amount of Excess Proceeds that resulted in the requirement to
make an Asset Disposition Offer shall be reset to zero (0) (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess
Proceeds upon such completion). Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset Disposition Offer, any
remaining Net Available Cash shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Company may use such Net
Available Cash for any purpose permitted by the Indenture.

To the extent that the aggregate amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes and Senior Secured
Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the amount offered
in the Asset Disposition Offer (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Company may use
any remaining Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) for any purposes not
otherwise prohibited under the Indenture.

An Asset Disposition Offer or Advance Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with
respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, the Notes and/or the Note Guarantees (but the
Asset Disposition Offer or Advance Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents).

Pending the final application of the amount of any Net Available Cash pursuant to this covenant, the Company
and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness, or otherwise use such Net Available Cash
in any manner permitted by the Indenture.

The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities
laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the
repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer or an Advance Offer. To the extent that the
provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Company will
comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its
obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

The provisions under the Indenture related to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes
as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes.

For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such indebtedness not denominated in euro, such
Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amount into its Euro Equivalent amount
determined as of a date selected by the Company that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period.

The Senior Facilities Agreement may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which
the Company becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuers from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this
covenant. In the event the Issuers are prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuers could seek the consent of
their lenders to the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such
prohibition. If the Issuers do not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from

261


-----

purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuers’ failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of
Default under the Indenture.

**Limitation on Affiliate Transactions**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into or conduct any transaction or
series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of
any service) with any Affiliate of the Company (any such transaction or series of related transactions being an
“Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of (x) €132 million and (y) an amount
equal to ten (10) per cent. of LTM EBITDA unless:

(i) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Company or

transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such transaction
in arm’s length dealings with a person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(ii) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of (x)
€198 million and (y) an amount equal to fifteen (15) per cent. of LTM EBITDA, the terms of such Affiliate
Transaction have been approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company;

Company, if any.

Entity, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation rights plans, participation plans,

Affiliate of such directors, officers, contractors, consultants, distributors or employees);

(vi) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries under
the terms of any transaction arising out of, and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any

the Company or the senior management of the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on
terms no less favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an
unaffiliated party;

(ix) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among the Company or any Restricted

Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any Permitted Holder owns an equity interest in, or otherwise controls
such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity; or

(B) due to the fact that a director of such person is also a director of the Company or any direct or indirect

faith by the Company;

of the Restricted Subsidiaries the majority of which Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock is purchased by

(xvii) any:

(A) Investments by Affiliates in securities of the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries (and

(ii) make any loans or advances to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(iii) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to_
dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the
application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to
constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(i) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Senior Facilities), (b) the
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (c) any other agreement or

Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Company or was merged, consolidated or otherwise combined
with or into the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or entered into in contemplation of or in connection
with such transaction) and outstanding on such date; provided that, for the purposes of this clause, if another
Person is the Successor Company (as defined below), any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of
such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary when such Person becomes the Successor Company;

assignment or transfer of any property or asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract or
agreement, or the assignment or transfer of any lease, license or other contract or agreement; (B) contained

265


-----

in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted under this Indenture or securing
Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted under this Indenture to the extent such

mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements; (C) contained in any trading, netting, operating,
construction, service, supply, purchase, sale or other agreement to which the Company or any of the
Restricted Subsidiaries is a party entered into in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past
practice; provided that such agreement prohibits the encumbrance of solely the property or assets of the

under “Limitation on Indebtedness” if the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such agreement
or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Holders (taken as a whole) than
(i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in (A) the Senior Facilities or the Indenture, together with
the Security Documents associated therewith, or the Senior Notes Indentures, together with the Topco
Security Documents associated therewith, and (B) the Intercreditor Agreement, in each case, as in effect on

material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the
Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other
modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Company).

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company may designate any Restricted Subsidiary (other than the Dollar Issuer) to be an Unrestricted
Subsidiary if that designation would not cause a Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate fair market value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Company
and the Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be
an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted
Payments pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” or under one or more
clauses of the definition of “Permitted Payments” or “Permitted Investments,” as determined by the Company.
That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted
Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The Company may redesignate any
Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if that redesignation would not cause a Default.

Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Company as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the Trustee
on the date of such designation by delivering to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such
designation complies with the preceding conditions and was permitted by the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Restricted Payments.” If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the
preceding requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for
purposes of the Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted
Subsidiary as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Company will be in default
of such covenant.

The Company may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that
such designation will be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any
outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (1) such
Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” (including
pursuant to clause (v) of the second paragraph thereof treating such redesignation as an acquisition for the
purpose of such clause), calculated on a pro forma basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of
the Applicable Test Date; and (2) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence following such
designation. Any such designation by the Company shall be evidenced to the Trustee by filing with the Trustee
an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complies with the preceding conditions.

**_Reports_**

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Company will furnish to the Trustee the following reports following
the Issue Date:

(1) within 120 days (or, in the case of the fiscal year ending September 30, 2020, 150 days) after the end of
each fiscal year of the Company, commencing with the fiscal year ending September 30, 2020, annual

provided in a previous report pursuant to clause (2) or (3) below); provided that such pro forma financial
information will be provided only to the extent available without unreasonable expense, in which case the
Company will provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired company financials; (iv) a brief
description of the business, management and shareholders of the Company, all material affiliate transactions
and a description of all material debt instruments and (v) a summary description of material risk factors and

December 31, 2020, quarterly financial statements containing the following information: (i) the Company’s
unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as at the end of such quarter and unaudited condensed

(ii) unaudited pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of the Company, together with
explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred
since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to which such quarterly report relates;
_provided that such pro forma financial information will be provided only to the extent available without_
unreasonable expense, in which case the Company will provide, in the case of a material acquisition,
acquired company financials; (iii) an operating and financial review of the unaudited financial statements,
including a discussion of the consolidated financial condition, results of operations, EBITDA and material
changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Company and (iv) material recent developments; and

(4) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Company announces publicly or any acquisition,
disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction that is material to the Company and the Restricted
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a change in a senior executive officer of the Company or a change in
auditors of the Company, a report containing a description of such event.

In addition, the Company shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of such
parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for so long
as the Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons who are not “affiliates” under the
Securities Act.

All financial statement information (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the calculations made under any
incurrence covenant, which shall be prepared in accordance with the terms of this Indenture) shall be prepared in
accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of
IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for the periods presented, except as may otherwise be described
in such information; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (3) and (4) above may, in the
event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods. No report need include
separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the Company or any disclosure with respect to the results of
operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure. In addition, the reports set forth above will not be
required to contain any reconciliation to U.S. GAAP.

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to be material if the entity or
business acquired or disposed of represents greater than 20% of the Company’s pro forma consolidated revenue
or LTM EBITDA for the most recent four quarters for which annual or quarterly financial reports have been
delivered to the Trustee.

At any time that any of the Company’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the
Company, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of this “Reports”
covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the
footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and the Restricted
Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the
Company.

In the event that (i) the Company becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports required by
Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Company elects to provide to the Trustee reports which, if filed with the
SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Company) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or
15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision of U.S. GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or
information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it elects, the Company will make available to
the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Company is, or would be,
required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d).

All reports provided pursuant to this “Reports” covenant shall be in English, or with a certified English
translation.

Subject to compliance with the next subsequent paragraph, in the event that, and for so long as, the equity
securities of the Company, the Target or any Parent Entity or IPO Entity are listed on the Main Market of the
London Stock Exchange (or one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange,

268


-----

the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange) and the Company,
the Target or such Parent Entity or IPO Entity is subject to the admission and disclosure standards applicable to
issuers of equity securities admitted to trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange (or the
equivalent standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to trading on one or more of the
equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange), for so long as it elects, the Company will make available to the
Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Company is, or would be, required
to file with the London Stock Exchange (or one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt
Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange)
pursuant to such admission and disclosure standards (or the applicable standards of one or more of the equivalent
regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
or the New York Stock Exchange, as applicable). Upon complying with the foregoing requirements, and
_provided that such requirements require the Company, the Target or any Parent Entity or IPO Entity to prepare_
and file annual reports, information, documents and other reports with the Main Market of the London Stock
Exchange, or one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock
Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange, as applicable, the Company will
be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in this “Reports” covenant.

The Company may comply with any requirement to provide reports or financial statements under this “Reports”
covenant by providing (x) any report or financial statements of a direct or indirect Parent Entity of the Company
so long as such reports (if an annual, half-yearly or quarterly report) (a) meet the requirements (including as to
content and time of delivery) of this “Reports” covenant as if references to the Company therein were references
to such Parent Entity and (b) include condensed consolidated financial information together with separate
columns for: (i) such Parent Entity; (ii) the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries on a combined basis;
(iii) any other Subsidiaries of the Parent Entity that are not the Company or Subsidiaries of the Company on a
combined basis; (iv) consolidating adjustments; and (v) the total consolidated amounts; or (y) any report or
financial statements of a direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company (including the Target) that represents
substantially all the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries (the “Reporting Subsidiary”) so long as
such reports (if an annual, half yearly or quarterly report) (a) meet the requirements (including as to content and
time of delivery) of this “Reports” covenant as if references to the Company therein were references to the
Reporting Subsidiary and (b) include condensed consolidated financial information together with separate
columns for: (i) the Company, (ii) the Reporting Subsidiary and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a combined basis;
(iii) any other Subsidiaries of the Company that are not the Reporting Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of the Reporting
Subsidiary on a combined basis; (iv) consolidating adjustments; and (v) the total consolidated amounts. Upon
complying with the requirements set forth in the preceding sentence, the Company will be deemed to have
complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

Any reports in respect of periods commencing prior to the Acquisition Closing Date (including in respect of any
comparative information) may, upon the election of the Company, include only the consolidated financial
information of the Target without any other financial information, after giving pro forma effect to the
Transactions. For purposes of this covenant and any determination or calculation to be made under the Indenture,
the Company may use financial statements of a predecessor of the Company or the Target for reporting or
making calculations with respect to periods commencing prior to the Acquisition Closing Date.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or negligently omit
to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security Interest with respect to the
Collateral (it being understood that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens, or the confirmation or
affirmation of security interests in respect of the Collateral, shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially
impair the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the
Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security
Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security
Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest in any of the
Collateral that is prohibited by the covenants described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “—Limitation
on Liens”; provided, that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur any Lien over any of the
Collateral that is not prohibited by the covenants described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” and
“—Limitation on Liens”, including Permitted Collateral Liens, and the Collateral may be discharged, transferred
or released in any circumstances not prohibited by the Indenture or the Security Documents.

269


-----

Notwithstanding the first paragraph of this covenant, nothing in this covenant shall restrict the discharge, transfer
or release of any Collateral or Lien in any circumstance in accordance with the Indenture and the Security
Documents. Subject to the foregoing, the Security Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented, replaced or otherwise modified or released (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at
least equivalent ranking over the same assets) (1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency
therein; (2) for the purposes of Incurring Permitted Collateral Liens; (3) to add to the Collateral; (4) to make any
other change thereto that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect; or (5) to amend, extend,
renew, restate, supplement, replace or otherwise modify or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien
of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets) any Security Documents for the purposes of undertaking a
Permitted Reorganization and/or Permitted Tax Restructuring or a transaction not prohibited by the covenants
described under “Merger and Consolidation”; provided, however, that in the case of clauses (4) and (5) above, no
Security Document may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, replaced or otherwise modified
or released (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets),
unless contemporaneously with such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement supplement, replacement or
modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same
assets), the Company delivers to the Security Agent and the Trustee, either (i) a solvency opinion, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Security Agent and the Trustee, from an Independent Financial Advisor
or appraiser or investment bank of international standing which confirms the solvency of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension,
renewal, restatement, supplement, replacement, modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a
Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), (ii) a certificate from the chief financial officer or the
Board of Directors of the relevant Person which confirms the solvency of the person granting any such Lien after
giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement,
replacement, modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking
over the same assets), or (iii) an Opinion of Counsel (subject to any qualifications customary for this type of
Opinion of Counsel), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving
effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, replacement,
modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same
assets), the Lien or Liens created under the Security Document, so amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented, replaced, modified or released (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent
ranking over the same assets) are valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection
or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately
prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, replacement, modification or release
(followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets) and to which
the new Indebtedness secured by the Permitted Collateral Lien is not subject.

In the event that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries comply with the requirements of this covenant, the
Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such
actions without the need for instructions from the Holders.

**_Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries_**

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Company shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary, other than a
Guarantor or a Securitization Subsidiary, to guarantee the payment of (i) any syndicated Credit Facility or
(ii) Public Debt of the Company or any Guarantor in an aggregate principal amount in excess of the greater of (x)
€331 million and (y) 25% of LTM EBITDA at such time, unless such Restricted Subsidiary within 60 days after
the guarantee of such Indebtedness executes and delivers a supplemental indenture to the Indenture providing for
a Note Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary, except that with respect to a guarantee of Indebtedness of the
Company or any Guarantor, if such Indebtedness is by its express terms subordinated in right of payment to the
Notes or such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee, any such guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary with respect to
such Indebtedness shall be subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee substantially to the same
extent as such Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes; provided that this covenant shall not be applicable to
any guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary that existed at the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary
and was not incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary.
The Company may elect, in its sole discretion, to cause any Subsidiary that is not otherwise required to be a
Guarantor to become a Guarantor, in which case such Subsidiary shall not be required to comply with the 60-day
period described in this paragraph.

At the option of the Company, any Note Guarantee may contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the extent
reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate

270


-----

to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital
maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other
considerations under applicable law.

Future Note Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under “Note
Guarantees—Note Guarantee Releases.” A Note Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the
option of the Company if at the date of such release there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding
which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with this
Indenture as at the date of such release if such Guarantor were not designated as a Guarantor as at that date. The
Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers
under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, reasonably requested by, and at the
cost of, the Company to effectuate any release of a Note Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject
to customary protections and indemnifications.

The validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of each
Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the
Notes—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Guarantees
and the Notes Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Notes
Collateral” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of
the Note Guarantees and Security Interests.”

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Company, in connection with the Incurrence by the
Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of: (i) any Indebtedness secured on Collateral or as otherwise
required herein; and (ii) any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness referred to in sub-clause
(i) above, the Company, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into
with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an
“Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) or a restatement, amendment or other modification of the existing
Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially
less favorable to the Holders (taken as a whole)), including substantially the same terms with respect to release of
Note Guarantees and priority and release of the Security Interests, provided that: (A) such Additional
Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent or, in the
reasonable opinion of the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties,
liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent under the Indenture, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement; (B) if more than one such intercreditor agreement is outstanding at
any time, the correlative terms of such intercreditor agreements must not conflict; and (C) regardless of the
number of Intercreditor Agreements or Additional Intercreditor agreements, only one payment blockage notice
may be served in any period of 360 consecutive days or in respect of the same event or circumstance and any
such payment blockages may not be in effect for more than 179 days in the aggregate during any consecutive
360-day period.

The Indenture will also provide that, at the direction of the Company and without the consent of Holders, the
Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, manifest error
or inconsistency of any such agreement; (ii) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such
agreement that may be Incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such
agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the
addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior to the Topco Notes); (iii) add Restricted
Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement; (iv) further secure the
Notes (including Additional Notes); (v) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure
Additional Notes; (vi) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens; (vii) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof; or (viii) make any other change to any
such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders (taken as a whole) in any material respect, making all
necessary provisions to ensure that the Notes and the Note Guarantees are secured by first-priority Liens over the
Collateral. In formulating its decisions on such matters, the Trustee and the Security Agent, if applicable, shall be
entitled to require and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including Officer’s Certificates
and Opinions of Counsel.

The Indenture will also provide that the Company shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to
enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, other than:
(i) in accordance with the second paragraph of this covenant; or (ii) with the consent of the requisite majority of

271


-----

Holders except as otherwise permitted below under “—Amendments and Waivers”, and the Company may only
direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not
impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent or, in the reasonable opinion of the Trustee
or the Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under this
Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the requisite majority of
Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of
any obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby, provided that such transaction would comply with the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and
accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
(whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein), and to have
directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Financial Calculations_**

When calculating the satisfaction of or availability under any Applicable Metric in the Indenture in connection
with any Applicable Transaction, the date of determination of such Applicable Metric shall, at the option of the
Company, be any Applicable Test Date. If the Company elects to determine any Applicable Metric as of any
Applicable Test Date, it shall give pro forma effect to any other Applicable Transactions that have occurred up to
(and including) such Applicable Test Date; provided that the pro forma calculation may exclude any
non-recurring fees, costs and expenses attributable to any Applicable Transaction.

If compliance with an Applicable Metric is established in accordance with the preceding paragraph, such
Applicable Metric shall be deemed to have been complied with (or satisfied) for all purposes; provided that
(a) the Company may elect, in its sole discretion, to recalculate any Applicable Metric on the basis of a more
recent Applicable Test Date, in which case, such date of redetermination shall thereafter be deemed to be the
relevant Applicable Test Date for purposes of such Applicable Metrics; and (b) save as contemplated in clause
(a) above, compliance with any Applicable Metric shall not be determined or tested at any time after the relevant
Applicable Test Date for such transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto.

If any Applicable Metric for which compliance was determined or tested as of an Applicable Test Date would at
any time after the Applicable Test Date have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been complied with as a
result of fluctuations in such Applicable Metric (or any other Applicable Metric), such Applicable Metric will not
be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to have been complied with as a result of such fluctuations.

If any related requirements and conditions (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of
Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was determined or tested as of the Applicable Test Date would at
any time after the Applicable Test Date not have been complied with or satisfied (including due to the occurrence
or continuation of a Default or an Event of Default), such requirements and conditions will not be deemed to
have been failed to be complied with or satisfied (and such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed not to
have occurred or be continuing).

If an item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) is committed, incurred or issued, any Lien is committed or
incurred or any other transaction is undertaken or any Applicable Metric is tested in reliance on a ratio-based
basket based on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Secured Net
Leverage Ratio or the Total Net Leverage Ratio or any other ratio based Applicable Metric, such ratios shall be
calculated without regard to the Incurrence of any Indebtedness to finance the working capital needs of the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries under any revolving facility, letter of credit facility or bank guarantee
facility and/or other debt which is available to be re-drawn (including under any Revolving Facility, any
Guarantee Facility or any ancillary facility under the Senior Facilities Agreement) and, for the avoidance of
doubt, any undrawn commitments for Indebtedness (including under a Revolving Facility or Guarantee Facility)
shall be disregarded for the purposes of testing the Applicable Metric.

If any Applicable Metric is determined by reference to the greater of a fixed amount (the “numerical
_permission”) and a percentage of LTM EBITDA (the “grower permission”) and the grower permission of the_
Applicable Metric exceeds the applicable numerical permission at any time as a result of an acquisition or
Investment that is permitted under the Indenture, the numerical permission shall be deemed to be increased to the
highest amount of the grower permission reached from time to time as a result of any such acquisitions and/or
investments and shall not subsequently be reduced as a result of any decrease in the grower permission.

272


-----

Subject to the limitations imposed under clause (ii) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under
“Limitation on Indebtedness,” if a proposed action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) is
incurred or entered into pursuant to a fixed permission and at a later time would subsequently be permitted under
a ratio-based permission, unless otherwise elected by the Company, such action, matter, transaction or amount
(or a portion thereof) shall automatically be reclassified to such ratio-based permission.

For any relevant Applicable Metric set by reference to a fiscal year, a calendar year, a Relevant Period, a fourquarter period, a twelve-month period or any other similar annual period (each an “Annual Period”):

(i) at the option of the Company, the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during such
Annual Period may be increased by: (A) an amount equal to 100% of the difference (if positive) between the
permitted amount in the immediately preceding Annual Period and the amount thereof actually used or
applied by the Group during such preceding Annual Period (the “Carry Forward Amount”); and/or (B) an
amount equal to 100% of the permitted amount in the immediately following Annual Period and the
permitted amount in such immediately following Annual Period shall be reduced by such corresponding
amount (the “Carry Back Amount”); and

(ii) to the extent that the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during such Annual
Period is increased in accordance with clause (i) above, any usage of such Applicable Metric during such
Annual Period shall be deemed to be applied in the following order: (A) first, against the Carry Forward
Amount; (B) second, against the maximum amount so permitted during such Annual Period prior to any
increase in accordance with clause (i) above; and (C) third, against the Carry Back Amount.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Company_

The Company will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise
dispose of all or substantially all its assets, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any person,
unless:

(i) the resulting, surviving or transferee person (the “Successor Company”) will be a person organised and
existing under the laws of England, Luxembourg, United States, Germany, a Member State of the European
Union (or any other jurisdiction approved by all of the Holders) and the Successor Company (if not the
Company) will expressly assume, by way of supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee,
all the obligations of the Company under the Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable;

(ii) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the applicable Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the applicable Successor Company as
a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the applicable Successor Company or such
Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and:

(A) the Company or the Successor Company would be able to Incur at least an additional €1.00 of
Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under “Limitation on
Indebtedness;” or

(B) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not be lower, or the Total Net Leverage Ratio would not be
higher, than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction;

(iii) the Company or the Successor Company, as the case may be, shall have delivered to the Trustee an
Officer’s Certificate to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental
indenture comply with the Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental
indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable, are legal and binding
agreements enforceable against the Successor Company; provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel,
counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact; and

(iv) the Holders (or the Security Agent on their behalf) will continue to have the same or substantially equivalent
(ignoring for the purposes of assessing such equivalency any limitations required in accordance with the
Agreed Security Principles or hardening periods (or any similar or equivalent concept)) guarantees and
security over the same or substantially equivalent assets and over the shares (or other interests) in the
Company or the Successor Company, save to the extent such assets or shares (or other interests) cease to
exist (provided that if the shares (or other interests) in the Company cease to exist, security will be granted
(subject to the Agreed Security Principles) over the shares (or other interests) in the Successor Company).

273


-----

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the
Company under the Notes and the Indenture.

_Dollar Issuer_

The Dollar Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise
dispose of all or substantially all its assets, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any person,
unless:

(i) the resulting, surviving or transferee person (the “Successor Dollar Issuer”) will be a person organised and
existing under the laws of England, Luxembourg, United States, Germany, a Member State of the European
Union (or any other jurisdiction approved by all of the Holders) and the Successor Dollar Issuer (if not the
Dollar Issuer) will expressly assume, by way of supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the
Trustee, all the obligations of the Dollar Issuer under the Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as
applicable;

(ii) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the applicable Successor Dollar Issuer or any Subsidiary of the applicable Successor Dollar
Issuer as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the applicable Successor Dollar Issuer or
such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing
and:

(A) the Dollar Issuer or the Successor Dollar Issuer would be able to Incur at least an additional €1.00 of
Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under “Limitation on
Indebtedness;” or

(B) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not be lower, or the Total Net Leverage Ratio would not be
higher, than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction;

(iii) the Dollar Issuer or the Successor Dollar Issuer, as the case may be, shall have delivered to the Trustee an
Officer’s Certificate to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental
indenture comply with the Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental
indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable, are legal and binding
agreements enforceable against the Successor Dollar Issuer; provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel,
counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact; and

(iv) the Holders (or the Security Agent on their behalf) will continue to have the same or substantially equivalent
(ignoring for the purposes of assessing such equivalency any limitations required in accordance with the
Agreed Security Principles or hardening periods (or any similar or equivalent concept)) guarantees and
security over the same or substantially equivalent assets and over the shares (or other interests) in the Dollar
Issuer or the Successor Dollar Issuer, except to the extent such assets or shares (or other interests) cease to
exist (provided that if the shares (or other interests) in the Dollar Issuer cease to exist, security will be
granted (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) over the shares (or other interests) in the Successor
Dollar Issuer).

The Successor Dollar Issuer will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of,
the Dollar Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture.

_Guarantors_

No Guarantor may:

(i) consolidate with or merge with or into any person;

(ii) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or dispose of, all or substantially all its assets, in one transaction or a
series of related transactions, to any person; or

(iii) permit any person to merge with or into such Guarantor,

unless:

(A) the other person is the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor (or becomes a Guarantor
substantially concurrently with the transaction); or

(B) either (x) the Company or a Guarantor is the continuing person or (y) the resulting, surviving or transferee
person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor under the Indenture and all obligations of

274


-----

the Company under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security
Documents, as applicable, and immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default is continuing;
or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the
Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (in each case other
than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Indenture.

_General_

The provisions set forth in this covenant “Merger and Consolidation” shall not restrict (and shall not apply to):

(i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Company, the Dollar Issuer or a Guarantor from consolidating with,
merging or liquidating into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Company,
Dollar Issuer, a Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Company, Dollar Issuer or a
Guarantor;

(ii) any Guarantor from merging or liquidating into or transferring all or part of its properties and assets to the
Company, Dollar Issuer or another Guarantor;

(iii) any consolidation or merger of the Company or the Dollar Issuer into any Guarantor; provided that, if the
Company or the Dollar Issuer, as applicable, is not the surviving entity of such merger or consolidation:

(A) the relevant Guarantor will assume the obligations of the Company or the Dollar Issuer, as applicable,
under the Notes, the Indenture, the Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents and:

(1) with respect to a merger or consolidation involving the Company, clauses (i), (iii) and (iv) of the
covenant described under “Merger and Consolidation—Company” above shall apply to such
transaction; and

(2) with respect to a merger or consolidation involving the Dollar Issuer, clauses (i), (iii) and (iv) of
the covenant described under “Merger and Consolidation—Dollar Issuer” shall apply to such
transaction; and

(B) to the extent that any Collateral previously granted over the shares in the capital of the relevant
Guarantor would not, in accordance with applicable law, constitute a Lien over the shares in the capital
of the surviving entity, the direct Holding Company of the surviving entity shall, subject to the Agreed
Security Principles, grant Collateral in the form of Security Interests over the shares in the capital of
the surviving entity on substantially equivalent terms to any Security Interests granted over the shares
in the capital of such predecessor Guarantor immediately prior to such merger or consolidation;

(iv) the Company, the Dollar Issuer or any Guarantor consolidating into or merging or combining with an
Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of such entity,
reincorporating such entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such entity; provided that,
in the case of a consolidation, merger or combination of:

(A) the Company into or with an Affiliate that is not a Guarantor, clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of the
covenant described under “Merger and Consolidation—Company” shall apply to such transaction;

and

(C) any Guarantor into or with an Affiliate, sub-clause (iii) above shall apply to such transaction; or

(v) the Transactions or any Permitted Transaction.

_Other Merger and Consolidation Terms_

A Permitted Specified Asset Disposition shall not be deemed to be the sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer,
lease or disposal of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company or one or more
Subsidiaries of the Company (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Dollar Issuer), and such Permitted
Specified Asset Disposition shall not be subject to the covenants described under “—Merger and
Consolidation—Company” and “—Merger and Consolidation—Dollar Issuer” and this “Merger and
Consolidation—Guarantors” covenant.

275


-----

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve
“all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, this covenant will not prohibit or restrict to the
Transactions or the creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary.

**Events of Default**

Subject to the two succeeding paragraphs, each of the following is an Event of Default under the Indenture:

(a) default in any payment of interest on any Note when due and payable, continued for thirty (30) days;

(b) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note when due at its Stated
Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;

(c) failure by the Company or any Guarantor to comply for sixty (60) days after written notice by the Trustee on
behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Notes with any agreement or obligation contained in the Indenture;

(d) the occurrence of any default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued
or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or
any Significant Subsidiary or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Company or any Significant
Subsidiary in each case other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, whether
such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the date hereof, which default:

(i) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness, at its stated final maturity (after giving
effect to any applicable grace periods) provided in such Indebtedness (a “payment default”); or

(ii) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity (the “cross-acceleration
_provision”),_

and, in each case, the aggregate principal amount of all Indebtedness subject to such payment defaults or
accelerations (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), is in excess of the greater of (x)
€331 million and (y) an amount equal to twenty-five (25) per cent. of LTM EBITDA;

(e) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of Topco, the Company, the Dollar Issuer or a
Significant Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”) which, in each case, are sanctioned by a court and
become unconditional;

(f) failure by the Company, the Dollar Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in
excess of the greater of (x) €331 million and (y) an amount equal to twenty-five (25) per cent. of LTM
EBITDA, other than any judgments covered by indemnities provided by, or insurance policies issued by,
reputable and creditworthy companies, which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for
a period of more than sixty (60) days (after receipt of notice from the Agent) after such judgment becomes
final, and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been
commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed (the “judgment
_default provision”);_

(g) any Security Interest under the Security Documents having a fair market value in excess of €132 million
shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant
Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture)
for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture or the release of any
such Security Interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents or any such Security Interest created
thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary shall
assert in writing that any such Security Interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default continues
for 10 days (the “security default provisions”);

(h) except as permitted under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (including with respect to any limitations), any Note Guarantee of any one or more Guarantors
that is an Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary is held in any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid
or ceases for any reason to be in full force and effect, or any one or more Guarantors that is an Issuer or a
Significant Subsidiary denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Note Guarantee (the “guarantee default
_provisions”); and_

276


-----

(i) the failure by the Company to consummate the Special Mandatory Redemption to the extent required, as
described under “Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

However, a Default under clauses (d) or (f) of the first paragraph above will not constitute an Event of Default
unless (i) the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have
notified the Company of the Default and (ii) the Company has not cured such Default within sixty (60) days after
receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (e) of the first paragraph of this section
“Events of Default”) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by written notice to the Company, or the Holders of at
least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may,
and the Trustee (subject to certain conditions) at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of and
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such
principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a
declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (d) has occurred and is
continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or
payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to such clause (d) shall be remedied or cured, or
waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have
been discharged in full, in each case, within thirty (30) days after the declaration of acceleration with respect
thereto and the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a
court of competent jurisdiction.

If an Event of Default described in clause (e) of the first paragraph of this section “Events of Default” occurs and
is continuing, the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes will become and be
immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the
Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive
all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to non-payment of principal, premium,
interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note held by a non-consenting Holder, which may only be waived
with the consent of Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes) and
rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences (including the payment default that
resulted from such acceleration) if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of
competent jurisdiction.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in
connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such
Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default that
resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or
Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant titled “—Certain
Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the
Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such
notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the
Indenture.

The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request
or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security
satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right
to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the
Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the Trustee
to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security and/or indemnity
satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and the
offer of security and/or indemnity; and

277


-----

(5) the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a
written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day
period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given
the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, of which a
responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its
powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee,
however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee
determines (after consultation with counsel) is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would
involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be
entitled to indemnification and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against all fees, losses,
liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.

The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed in writing of
such occurrence by the Company, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after
being notified by the Company. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if
any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith
determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders.

The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s
Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year.
The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of
any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the
Company is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Except as provided in the next two succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture and the other Note Documents may be
amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender
offer or exchange offer for, such Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any existing Default or Event of
Default (other than a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal or premium, Additional Amounts, if
any, or interest on any Note (including in connection with an offer to purchase), except a payment default
resulting from an acceleration that has been rescinded) or compliance with any provision of the Indenture and the
other Note Documents may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or
tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes). If any amendment, supplement or waiver will only affect one or
more series of Notes (but not all series of Notes), only the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the then outstanding Notes of the series so affected (and not the consent of the Holders of at least a
majority in aggregate principal amount of all Notes then outstanding), shall be required.

However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% (or, in the case of clause (7) of this
paragraph, 80%) of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes (provided, however, that if any
amendment, supplement, waiver or other modification or consent will only affect one or more series of Notes
(but not all series of Notes), only the consent of the holders of at least 90% (or, in the case of clause (7) below,
80%) of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of the series so affected will be required),
an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Note (other than
provisions relating to a Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(2) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Note (other than provisions relating to a
Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(3) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Note or change the time at which any such
Note may be redeemed, in each case as described under “Optional Redemption” and “Redemption for
Taxation Reasons”;

(4) make any such Note payable in currency other than that stated in such Note;

278


-----

(5) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal of, or interest
or Additional Amounts, if any, on such Holder’s Notes on or after the due dates therefor;

(6) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture described under “Withholding Taxes” that adversely
affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the terms of such Notes in a
way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an exemption
from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder unless the applicable Payor agrees
to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(7) release all or substantially all Security Interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral (taken
as a whole) other than in accordance with the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement,
any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture; provided that, for the avoidance of
doubt and without prejudice to the provisions governing a Change of Control, the release of less than all or
substantially all Security Interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral (taken as a whole)
shall only require the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer
for, Notes) and any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of
the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents
obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes);

(8) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest or
Additional Amounts, if any (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at
least a majority in principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from
such acceleration);

(9) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Note Guarantee or this Indenture, except in
accordance with the terms of this Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(10) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose holders must consent to any amendment, waiver or
modification or make any other change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’
consent described in this sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Company, the Issuers, the Trustee and the
other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Note Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect, error or inconsistency or reduce the minimum denomination
of the Notes;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person or a co-issuer of the obligations of the Issuers or a
Guarantor under any Note Document, including, without limitation, in connection with a Permitted
Reorganization);

(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Note Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any right or
power conferred upon the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or make
any change (including changing the ISIN, common code, CUSIP or other identifying number on any Notes)
that does not adversely affect the rights of the Trustee or any Holder in any material respect;

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a member of
senior management of the Issuers) for the issuance of Additional Notes that may be issued in compliance
with this Indenture;

(6) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the covenants described
under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness
by Restricted Subsidiaries,” to add Note Guarantees with respect to the Notes, to add security to or for the
benefit of the Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any
Guarantee or Lien with respect to or securing the Notes when such release, termination, discharge or
retaking is provided for under the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under any Debt Document of a successor Trustee
pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee to any Note Document;

(8) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a Security Interest in favor
of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior

279


-----

Notes Indenture or the Private Senior Notes Indenture, in any property which is required by the Security
Documents to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a Security Interest is required to be
granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a Security Interest in the Collateral for the
benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such Security Interest is not prohibited by the Indenture,
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant described under
“—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” is complied with;

(9) conform the text of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Notes to any provision of this “Description
of the Senior Secured Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of the Senior Secured
Notes” was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Security Documents or
the Notes;

(10) make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of Notes as
permitted by the Indenture, including to facilitate the issuance and administration of Notes; provided,
_however, that (i) compliance with the this Indenture as so amended would not result in Notes being_
transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any other applicable securities law and (ii) such amendment
does not adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer Notes in any material respect;

(11) comply with the rules of any applicable securities depositary;

(12) facilitate any transaction that complies with the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” and “—Merger and Consolidation”, relating to
mergers, consolidations and sales of assets; and

(13) comply with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements”.

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of, or actions taken in compliance with, the covenants
described under “—Certain Covenants” or this section “Amendments and Waivers” shall be deemed to impair or
affect any rights of Holders to receive payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on the Notes.

In formulating its decisions on such matters, the Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to
require and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including Officer’s Certificates and
Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed
amendment, supplement or waiver of any Note Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance
thereof. A consent to any amendment, supplement or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder given in
connection with a sale or tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such sale or tender.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the paragraphs above, in order to effect an amendment authorized by
clauses (3) and (6) of the third paragraph of this section “Amendments and Waivers” to add a Guarantor under
the Indenture, it shall only be necessary for the supplemental indenture providing for the accession of such
additional Guarantor to be duly authorized and executed by (i) the Issuers, (ii) such additional Guarantor and
(iii) the Trustee. Any other amendments permitted by the Indenture need only be duly authorized and executed
by the Issuers, the Trustee and the Security Agent (to the extent applicable).

The Indenture will not contain a covenant regulating the offer and/or payment of a consent fee to Holders.

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of Notes have concurred in any direction,
waiver or consent, Notes owned by the Company, or by any Person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled
by or under direct or indirect common control with the Company, will be considered as though not outstanding,
except that for the purposes of determining whether the Trustee will be protected in relying on any such
direction, waiver or consent, only Notes that a responsible officer of the Trustee actually knows are so owned
will be so disregarded. For the avoidance of doubt, any Independent Debt Fund shall not be considered to be a
Person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the
Company.

**Defeasance**

The Company at any time may terminate all obligations of Topco, the Company, the Issuers and the Guarantors
under the Note Documents (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except
for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties,
immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Company in connection therewith and
obligations concerning issuing temporary Notes, registrations of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes
and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to

280


-----

the foregoing, if the Company exercises its legal defeasance option, the Security Documents and the rights of the
Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at
such time will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Company at any time may terminate the obligations of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries under
the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (i), (iii) and (iv) of each of “—Certain
Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Company” and “—Certain Covenants—Merger and
Consolidation—The Dollar Issuer”) and “—Change of Control” and the default provisions relating to such
covenants described under “—Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross-default upon a payment
default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions (other than with respect to the Issuers), the
judgment default provision, the guarantee provision, and the security default provision described under
“—Events of Default” above (“covenant defeasance”).

The Company at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise
of its covenant defeasance option. If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes
may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. If the Company exercises its
covenant defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an
Event of Default specified in clause (c), (d), (e) (with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries other than the
Dollar Issuer), (f) or (g) under “—Events of Default” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Company (i) must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance
_trust”) with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for this purpose) (a)_
for the benefit of the Holders of the Euro Notes, cash in euro or European Government Obligations or a
combination thereof; and (b) for the benefit of the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes, cash in U.S. dollars or U.S.
Government Securities or a combination thereof, for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on
the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be; provided, that upon any redemption that requires the
payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the
extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of
the notice of redemption, with any deficit as of the date of redemption (any such amount, the “Applicable
_Premium Deficit”) only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption. Any_
Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee simultaneously
with the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit shall be
applied toward such redemption, and (ii) must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the
Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, to the effect that Holders and
beneficial owners will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of
such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts and in the
same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not
occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel must be based on a ruling of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Service or change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law since the issuance of the
Notes);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Company with the intent of defeating,
hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Company; and

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to customary
assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to legal
defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, will be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except
as to surviving rights of transfer or exchange of the Notes and rights of the Trustee, as expressly provided for in
the Indenture) as to all Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than
certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes and certain Notes for which provision for payment was previously made
and thereafter the funds have been released to the Company) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation;
or (b) all Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will
become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within
one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee or
the Paying Agent in the name, and at the expense, of the Company; (2) the Company has deposited or caused to

281


-----

be deposited with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for this
purpose), (i) for the benefit of the Holders of the Euro Notes, money in euro or European Government
Obligations, or a combination thereof, and (ii) for the benefit of the Holders of the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes,
money in U.S. dollars or U.S. Government Securities or a combination thereof, as applicable, in an amount
sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of deposit
(in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case
may be; provided that upon any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount
deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the
Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any
Applicable Premium Deficit only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption,
and any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee
simultaneously with the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable Premium
Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption; (3) the Issuers have paid or caused to be paid all other sums
payable under the Indenture; (4) the Issuers have delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the
Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption date,
as the case may be; and (5) the Issuers have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel each stating that all conditions precedent under the “—Satisfaction and Discharge” section of the
Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with; provided that any
such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the
foregoing clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4)).

If requested in writing by the Company to the Trustee and the Principal Paying Agent, the Trustee will distribute
any amounts deposited to the Holders prior to Stated Maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be;
_provided, however, that the Holders shall have received at least five Business Days’ notice from the Company of_
such earlier repayment date (which may be included in the notice of redemption). For the avoidance of doubt, the
distribution and payment to Holders prior to the maturity or redemption date as set forth above will not include
any negative interest, present value adjustment, break costs or any other premium on such amounts.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Note Documents or for
any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a
Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of
the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the
view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee**

Deutsche Trustee Company Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will provide
that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has
written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in such Indenture. During the
existence of an Event of Default, of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the
Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of
care that a prudent person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or
refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.
Furthermore, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at
the request of any Holder, unless such Holder has offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to
the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the
Company, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of
any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee or any Agent will be permitted to engage in other
transactions with the Company and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced. Such terms
will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Company
and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated or
(b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Company may remove the

282


-----

Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than 6 months may petition any court for
removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the
successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, taxes and
expenses incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or in connection with
the acceptance or administration of the Indenture. In formulating its decisions, the Trustee and the Security
Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate,
including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

**Notices**

If and for so long as Notes are listed on the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules of the Exchange so
require, notices of the Company with respect to the Notes will be sent to the Exchange.

All notices to Holders of Notes will be validly given if electronically delivered or mailed to them at their
respective addresses in the register of the Holders, if any, maintained by the registrar. For so long as any Notes
are represented by global notes, all notices to Holders will be delivered to DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream in
accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, delivery of which shall be
deemed to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph, which will give such notices to the Holders of book-entry
interests.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more than
once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed, such
notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after being so
mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or
other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed.
Failure to electronically deliver or mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuers or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, premium, if any, or Additional
Amounts, if any, on the Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof.
Claims against the Issuers or any Guarantor for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed six years

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions**

Euro, with respect to the Euro Notes and the Euro Issuer, and U.S. dollars, with respect to the Dollar Fixed Rate
Notes and the Dollar Issuer, are the required currencies (each, a “Required Currency”) of account and payment
for all sums payable by the Issuers and the Guarantors, if any, under or in connection with the Notes and the Note
Guarantees thereof, if any, including damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than the
applicable Required Currency, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any
jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuers, any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder, any
Paying Agent or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuers or a Guarantor
will only constitute a discharge to the Issuers or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the amount of the
applicable Required Currency which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in
that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that
date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so). If the amount of the applicable Required Currency is
less than the amount of the Required Currency expressed to be due to the recipient, any Paying Agent or the
Trustee under any Note, the Issuers and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such
recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuers and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient, any
Paying Agent or the Trustee on a joint and several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the
purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the
Holder of a Note or any Paying Agent or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the
applicable Issuer (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase.

283


-----

These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuers’ and the Guarantors’ other
obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver
granted by any Holder of a Note, any Paying Agent or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out
herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a
liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or any Note Guarantee, or to the Trustee. Except as
otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated
restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a non-euro currency
shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such non-euro amount is
Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Listing**

Application will be made to list the Notes on the Exchange and for permission to be granted to deal in the Notes
on the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the application to list the Notes on the Exchange will be
approved or that permission to deal in the Notes thereon will be granted, and settlement of the Notes is not
conditioned on obtaining this listing or permission.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since a material portion of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries are located outside the United States,
any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuers or the Guarantors, including judgments with
respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and
any purchase price with respect to the Notes, may not be collectable within the United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the Notes, the
Issuers and the Guarantors will in the Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state
courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City, County and State of New York, in the United States of America.
The Indenture will provide that each of the Issuers and the Guarantors will appoint an agent for service of process
in any suit, action or proceeding with respect to the Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees brought in any
U.S. federal or New York state court located in the City of New York.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Notes, including any Note Guarantees, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. For the avoidance of
doubt, the governing law of the Indenture and the Notes may be amended with the consent of Holders of at least
a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a

**DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR NOTES**

The following is a description of the €650,000,000 aggregate principal amount of % Senior Notes due 2028
(the “Euro Fixed Rate Notes”) and the €400,000,000 (USD equivalent) aggregate principal amount of %
Senior Notes due 2028 (the “Dollar Fixed Rate Notes” and, together with the Euro Fixed Rate Notes, the
“Notes”). The Notes will be issued by Vertical Holdco GmbH, a Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung
organized under the laws of Germany (the “Company”). For purposes of this “Description of the Senior Notes,”
references to (i) the “Company” refer only to Vertical Holdco GmbH and none of its subsidiaries and (ii) “we,”
“our,” “Group” and “us” refer only to the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries.

The proceeds from the offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date and the Equity Contribution (as defined
below) will be provided by the Company to Midco to be used, together with the proceeds of the Secured Notes
(as defined below) sold on the Issue Date and borrowings under the Senior Facilities Agreement (as defined
below), to finance the Acquisition and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions, as
set forth in this offering memorandum under the caption “Use of Proceeds.” Pending consummation of the
Acquisition and the satisfaction of certain other conditions as described below, the Company will, concurrently
with the closing of the offering of the Notes on the Issue Date, deposit, or cause to be deposited on its behalf, an
amount in cash equal to (i) the gross proceeds of the Euro Fixed Rate Notes sold on the Issue Date into the Euro
Escrow Account (as defined below) and (ii) the gross proceeds of the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes sold on the Issue
Date into the Dollar Escrow Account (as defined below). In the event that (i) the Escrow Longstop Date (as
defined below) occurs and the Escrow Agent (as defined below) shall not have received the Escrow Release
Officer’s Certificate (as defined below) on or prior to such date or (ii) the Company informs the Escrow Agent in
writing that, in the good faith judgment of the Company, the Acquisition will not be consummated on or prior to
the Escrow Longstop Date, the Company will redeem the entire outstanding aggregate principal amount of each
series of the Notes at a price equal to 100% of the issue price of the Notes as stated on the cover page of this
offering memorandum, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes and Additional Amounts, if any, from, and
including, the Issue Date to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below). See
“Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” Upon the initial issuance of the Notes on the Issue Date,
the Notes will only be obligations of the Company and the Initial Guarantors (as defined below) and will not be
guaranteed by the Target or any of its Subsidiaries. Assuming the Acquisition Closing Date occurs on or prior to
the Escrow Longstop Date and the funds are released from the Escrow Accounts (as defined below), the PostClosing Guarantors will, within 150 days from (and excluding) the Acquisition Closing Date, subject to the
Agreed Security Principles and substantially concurrently with the guarantees granted in favor of obligations
under the Senior Facilities Agreement, accede to the Indenture (as defined below) and the Intercreditor
Agreement and guarantee the Notes on a senior subordinated basis.

Prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, neither the Company nor the Initial Guarantors will control the Target or
any of its Subsidiaries, and none of the Target or any of its Subsidiaries will be subject to the covenants
described in this “Description of the Senior Notes.” As such, we cannot assure you that, prior to the Acquisition
Closing Date, the Target Group will not engage in activities that would otherwise have been prohibited by the
Indenture had those covenants been applicable to such entities as of the Issue Date and any such non-compliance
will not constitute a Default or Event of Default under the Indenture prior to the Acquisition Closing Date.

The Company will issue the Notes under an indenture (the “Indenture”), to be dated as of the Issue Date, among,
_inter alios, the Company, the other Initial Guarantors (as defined below), Deutsche Trustee Company Limited, as_
trustee (the “Trustee”), and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as security agent (the “Security Agent”). The
Notes will be issued in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities
Act. See “Notice to Certain Investors.” The Notes are subject to all such terms pursuant to the provisions of the
Indenture, and Holders are referred to the Indenture for a statement thereof.

The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and refers to the Notes, the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Topco Security Documents and the Escrow Agreement. Because this is a summary, it may not
contain all the information that is important to you. You should read each of the Indenture, the Notes, the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Topco Security Documents and the Escrow Agreement in their entirety. Copies of
such documents are available as described under “Where You Can Find Other Information.” You can find the
definitions of certain terms used in this description under “—Certain Definitions” below. The capitalized terms
defined in “—Certain Definitions” below are used in this “Description of the Senior Notes” as so defined.

The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements (as defined below) and in the case of a conflict between anything in the Indenture, the Notes or the
Topco Security Documents (other than any Topco Security Documents which are governed by German law and
which need to be notarized) and anything in the Intercreditor Agreement, the terms of the Intercreditor

332


-----

Agreement will prevail. The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the relative
ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, the procedures
for undertaking enforcement action, the subordination of certain indebtedness, enforcement standstills, payment
blockages, turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees, and the payment waterfall for amounts
received by the Security Agent. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”
for a description of certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Company will not be required to, nor does the Company currently intend to, offer to exchange the Notes for
notes registered under the Securities Act or otherwise register or qualify by prospectus the Notes for resale under
the Securities Act. The Indenture will not be qualified under, or incorporate by reference or include, or be subject
to, any provisions of the Trust Indenture Act, including Section 316(b) thereof. Accordingly, the terms of the
Notes include only those stated in the Indenture, and the Holders will not be entitled to the protections provided
under the Trust Indenture Act to holders of debt securities issued under a qualified indenture, including among
other things, those requiring the Trustee to resign in the event of certain conflicts of interest and to inform
Holders of certain relationships between it and us.

**Brief Description of the Notes and the Note Guarantees**

Prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, the Notes will initially be senior obligations solely of the
Company, guaranteed solely by the Initial Guarantors, secured (i) on a first-priority basis by the Independent
Topco Collateral (as defined below), (ii) on a second-priority basis by the Topco Shared Collateral (as defined
below) and (iii) on a first-priority basis by the respective Escrowed Property (as defined below) and will not have
the benefit of any Guarantees or any other credit support from thyssenkrupp Elevator AG (the “Target”) or any
of its Subsidiaries (together, the “Target Group”). See “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”
Prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, neither the Company nor the Initial Guarantors will control the Target or
any of its Subsidiaries, and none of the Target or any of its Subsidiaries will be subject to the covenants
described in this “Description of the Senior Notes.” As such, we cannot assure you that, prior to the Acquisition
Closing Date, the Target Group will not engage in activities that would otherwise have been prohibited by the
Indenture had those covenants been applicable to such entities as of the Issue Date and any such non-compliance
will not constitute a Default or Event of Default under the Indenture prior to the Acquisition Closing Date.

From and after the consummation of the Acquisition, the Notes will:

- be general senior obligations of the Company, secured as set forth under “Security”;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of the Company that is not
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including the Private Notes;

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of the Company that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

- be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or other liabilities of the Company and its
subsidiaries that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes (including obligations under
the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Secured Notes and certain Hedging Obligations), to the extent of the
property and value of the assets securing such Indebtedness or liabilities;

- be structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities, including preferred
stock and obligations to trade creditors, of Subsidiaries of the Company that are not Guarantors;

- be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis (i) on the Issue Date, by the Initial Guarantors and (ii) within
150 days from the Acquisition Closing Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and substantially
concurrently with the guarantees granted in favor of obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the
Post-Closing Guarantors; and

- be represented by one or more registered Notes in global form, but in certain circumstances may be
represented by certificated Notes. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.”

Each Note Guarantee (as defined below) will:

 - be a general senior subordinated obligation of the Guarantor, secured as set forth under “Security”;

 - be subordinated in right of payment to any existing and future senior indebtedness of that Guarantor,
including its obligations under the Senior Facilities, the Secured Notes and certain Hedging Obligations;

 - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of such Guarantor that is not
subordinated in right of payment to the Note Guarantee of such Guarantor including the guarantees of the
Private Notes;

333


-----

 - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of such Guarantor that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Note Guarantee of such Guarantor;

 - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness or other liabilities of such Guarantor and
its subsidiaries that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes or the Note Guarantees, or
that is secured on a first-priority basis over property or assets that secure the Notes or the Note Guarantees
on a second-priority basis (including obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Secured Notes
and certain Hedging Obligations), to the extent of the value of the assets securing such Indebtedness or
liabilities; and

 - be structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities, including preferred
stock and obligations to trade creditors, of Subsidiaries of such Guarantor that are not Guarantors.

As of March 31, 2020, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries would have had € million (equivalent) of total Indebtedness, including (i) € million
(equivalent) of Indebtedness secured, among other things, on the Topco Shared Collateral on a first-priority
basis, consisting of € million (equivalent) of term loan drawings under the Senior Facilities Agreement
and € million (equivalent) under the Secured Notes and (ii) € million (equivalent) of Indebtedness
secured on the Topco Shared Collateral on a second-priority basis and the Independent Topco Collateral on a
first-priority basis, consisting of € million (equivalent) under the Notes and € million (equivalent)
under the Private Notes.

**Principal and Maturity**

On the Issue Date, the Company will issue € million aggregate principal amount Euro Fixed Rate Notes
and $ million aggregate principal amount Dollar Fixed Rate Notes. The Notes will mature on,
2028. The Euro Fixed Rate Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Dollar Fixed Rate Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of
$200,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream are not required to monitor or enforce the minimum amount. The rights of Holders of beneficial
interests in the Notes to receive the payments on such Notes are subject to applicable procedures of DTC,
Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a
Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to
payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any
further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

**Interest**

_Euro Fixed Rate Notes_

Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from
the date of original issuance. Interest on overdue principal and interest on the Euro Fixed Rate Notes will accrue

cancellation on a date that is on or after the record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment date,

the Holder in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date in accordance with
the applicable procedures of DTC, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be
subject to redemption by the Company.

Any Notes represented by global notes held by a nominee of DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream will be subject

Clearstream’s current practice is to make payments in respect of global notes to participants of record that hold
an interest in the relevant global notes on the business day immediately preceding the applicable interest payment
date.

**Additional Notes**

The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which € million aggregate principal
amount Euro Fixed Rate Notes and $ million aggregate principal amount Dollar Fixed Rate Notes will be
issued in this offering. The Company may issue additional Euro Fixed Rate Notes (the “Additional Euro Fixed
_Rate Notes”) and additional Dollar Fixed Rate Notes (the “Additional Dollar Fixed Rate Notes” and, together_
with any Additional Euro Fixed Rate Notes, the “Additional Notes”), from time to time under the Indenture,
subject to compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture. Any series of Additional Euro Fixed Rate
Notes and Additional Dollar Fixed Rate Notes shall have terms substantially identical to the Euro Fixed Rate

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Notes;

(3) the date or dates on which such Additional Notes will be issued and will mature;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Notes shall bear interest and, if

or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment dates on which such interest shall be
payable or the method by which such dates will be determined, the record dates for the determination of
holders thereof to whom such interest is payable and the basis upon which such interest will be calculated;

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Notes shall be denominated and the currency in which
cash or government obligations in connection with such series of Additional Notes may be payable;

(6) the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which, and the terms and
conditions upon which, such Additional Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part;

thereof, in the case of Additional Dollar Fixed Rate Notes, the denominations in which such Additional
Notes shall be issued and redeemed; and

(8) the ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification numbers with respect to such Additional
Notes.

Such Additional Notes will be treated, along with all other Notes, as a single class for the purposes of the
Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments and all other matters which are not specifically distinguished for
such series in such Officer’s Certificate; provided that any Additional Notes that are not fungible with the
applicable series of Notes offered hereunder for U.S. federal income tax purposes shall have a separate ISIN,
Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number from such Notes. Unless the context otherwise
requires, for all purposes of the Indenture and this “Description of the Senior Notes,” references to “Notes” shall
be deemed to include references to the Notes initially issued on the Issue Date as well as any Additional Notes.

shall be deemed to form one series and references to such series of Notes shall be deemed to include the Notes
initially issued on the Issue Date as well any such Additional Notes.

336


-----

Official List of The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Exchange”) and if and to the extent
that the rules of the Exchange so require, the Company will notify the Exchange of any change of Paying Agent,
Registrar or Transfer Agent. The Company or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in
respect of the Notes provided that it segregates and holds in a separate trust fund for the benefit of the Holders all
money held by it as paying agent.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The applicable registrar and the
Trustee may require a Holder to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents in connection with a

made without charge to Holders, other than any taxes payable in connection with such transfer. The Company

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

As of the Issue Date, each Initial Guarantor will be a “Restricted Subsidiary” of the Company for the purposes of
the Indenture. Immediately after the completion of the Acquisition on the Acquisition Closing Date, the Target
and all of its subsidiaries as of such date will become Restricted Subsidiaries of the Company. However, in the
circumstances described below under “—Certain Covenants—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted
Subsidiaries,” the Company will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries.
Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not
guarantee, or provide security with respect to, the Notes.

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption**

This offering of the Notes will be consummated prior to the consummation of the Acquisition. Substantially
concurrently with the closing of the offering of the Notes on the Issue Date, the Company will enter into an
escrow agreement (as amended, supplemented or modified from time to time, the “Escrow Agreement”) among
the Company, the Trustee, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch as euro escrow agent (in such capacity, together
with its successors, the “Euro Escrow Agent”) and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch as dollar escrow agent (in
such capacity, together with its successors, the “Dollar Escrow Agent”), pursuant to which the Company will
deposit, or cause to be deposited on its behalf, an amount in cash equal to (y) the gross proceeds of the Euro
Fixed Rate Notes sold on the Issue Date into one escrow account (the “Euro Escrow Account”) and (z) the gross
proceeds of the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes sold on the Issue Date into another escrow account (the “Dollar Escrow
_Account” and, together with the Euro Escrow Account, the “Escrow Accounts”). The Escrow Accounts_
established will each be segregated from the Company’s other funds. The Euro Escrow Account will be
controlled by the Euro Escrow Agent, and the Dollar Escrow Account will be controlled by the Dollar Escrow
Agent, in each case subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders of the
applicable series of Notes. The initial funds deposited in the Escrow Accounts, and all other funds, securities,
interest, dividends, distributions and other property and payments credited to the Escrow Accounts in connection
with the Notes (less any property and/or funds paid in accordance with the Escrow Agreement such as ordinary
course charges and fees paid to the bank holding the Escrow Accounts) are referred to, collectively, as the
“Escrowed Property.” Interest will be calculated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Notes.

To secure the payment of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price (as defined below) of the Euro Fixed Rate
Notes and the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes, as applicable, the Company will grant the Trustee, for its benefit and the
benefit of the Holders of the applicable series of Notes, subject to certain liens of the Escrow Agent, a firstpriority security interest in the Euro Escrow Account and the Dollar Escrow Account, as applicable, and the
Company’s rights under the Escrow Agreement, pursuant to one or more escrow account charges dated the Issue
Date between the Company, the Trustee and the Escrow Agent (the “Escrow Charges”); provided, however that
such liens and security interest shall automatically be released and terminate upon receipt by the Trustee of either
an Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate (as defined below) or a notice of Special Mandatory Redemption (as
defined below). The Escrow Charges will provide that the funds will be segregated and held for the purposes
specified herein. By its acceptance of the Notes, each Holder shall be deemed to authorize and direct the Trustee
to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent will invest the

337


-----

Escrowed Property as directed by the Company in such short-term liquid investments (including bank deposit
products) as permitted under the Escrow Agreement, and liquidate such investments, as the Company will from
time to time direct in writing.

The Escrow Agreement shall provide for the Escrow Agent to release from each Escrow Account, upon
instruction of the Company, a portion of the Escrowed Property in an amount equal to the amount of accrued and
unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from, and including, the Issue Date or the most recent interest
payment date, as applicable, to, but excluding, any interest payment date prior to the Escrow Release in order to
satisfy the interest payment obligations in respect of the Euro Fixed Rate Notes or the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes,
as applicable, under the Indenture as set forth under “—Principal, Maturity and Interest.” In addition, the Escrow
Agent will be entitled pursuant to the Escrow Agreement to deduct amounts from the Escrowed Property in
respect of negative interest having accrued on the Escrowed Property.

Other than in connection with the payment of interest and Additional Amounts, if any, as set forth in the previous
paragraph, the Company will be entitled to cause the Escrow Agent to release Escrowed Property (in which case
the Escrowed Property will be paid to, or as directed by, the Company) (the “Escrow Release”) (the date of the
Escrow Release being referred to as the “Escrow Release Date”) upon delivery to the Escrow Agent, on or prior
to December 31, 2020 (the “Escrow Longstop Date”), of an Officer’s Certificate (the “Escrow Release Officer’s
_Certificate”), upon which the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely absolutely without further investigation,_
certifying that the following conditions (collectively, the “Escrow Conditions”) will be met substantially
concurrently with or promptly following the Release on the Escrow Release Date:

(1) the funds required to pay the consideration for the Acquisition will be required promptly (and in any event
within two Business Days) following the release of the Escrowed Property to consummate the Acquisition
substantially on the terms set forth under “Summary-The Transactions”; and

(2) the conditions precedent to borrowing under the Senior Facilities (other than any condition precedent
relating to the Release or satisfaction of the Escrow Conditions) shall have been, or substantially
concurrently shall be, satisfied or waived in all material respects.

Upon the Escrow Release, the Escrowed Property will be paid out of the Escrow Accounts in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement for the purposes described under “Use of Proceeds” and the Escrow Accounts will be reduced
to zero.

In the event that (i) the Escrow Longstop Date occurs and the Escrow Agent shall not have received the Escrow
Release Officer’s Certificate on or prior to such date or (ii) the Company informs the Escrow Agent and the
Trustee in writing that, in the good faith judgment of the Company, the Acquisition will not be consummated on
or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, (the date of any such event being the “Special Termination Date”), the
Company will redeem the entire outstanding aggregate principal amount of each series of the Notes (the “Special
_Mandatory Redemption”) at a price (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Price”) equal to 100% of the issue_
price of such series of Notes as stated on the cover page of this offering memorandum, plus accrued and unpaid
interest on the Notes and Additional Amounts, if any, from, and including, the Issue Date to, but excluding, the
Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below), subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date.

Notice of the Special Mandatory Redemption will be delivered by the Company no later than one Business Day
following the Special Termination Date, to the Trustee, the Escrow Agent and the Paying Agents, and will
provide that the Notes shall be redeemed on a date that is no later than the tenth Business Day after such notice is
given by the Company in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement (the “Special Mandatory
_Redemption Date”). On the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Paying_
Agents for payment to each Holder of Notes the Special Mandatory Redemption Price for such Holder’s Notes,
shall be entitled to use the Escrowed Property to make such payments and, concurrently with the payment to such
Holders, deliver any excess Escrowed Property (if any) to the Company. Notice of such Special Mandatory
Redemption shall be given to the Holders of the Notes at least five Business Days before the Special Mandatory
Redemption Date.

The Escrow Accounts will not include cash to fund any accrued and unpaid interest owing to Holders of the
Notes, which is included in the Special Mandatory Redemption Price. In the event that the Special Mandatory
Redemption Price payable upon such Special Mandatory Redemption of the Euro Fixed Rate Notes or Dollar
Fixed Rate Notes exceeds the amount of the applicable Escrowed Property, Parentco will be required to make an
equity contribution to the Company to fund the difference between the applicable Special Mandatory
Redemption Price and the amount of the Escrowed Property pursuant to a commitment provided by it.

-----

The Company from time to time, but not more than twice in aggregate, may open one or more replacement or
additional accounts at an alternative bank or banks, which in each case must be an Initial Purchaser or one or
more of their respective banking affiliates, and may transfer any portion of the Escrowed Property to any such
replacement or additional accounts (a “Transfer”) without such Transfer being deemed a Release; provided that
the Company provide a substantially equivalent security interest to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders over
such replacement or additional account or accounts if such security interest was initially granted in connection
with the original Escrow Account; and provided further that use of the funds from any such account shall be
subject to the same conditions as applied to the original Escrow Account. In such an event, any replacement or
alternative accounts into which Escrowed Property is transferred shall be deemed to be an Escrow Account.
Receipt by the Trustee from the Company of an Officer’s Certificate in connection with a Transfer shall
constitute deemed consent by the Trustee for the transfer of the Escrowed Property from the original Escrow
Account to a new Escrow Account.

If at the time of such Special Mandatory Redemption, the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange
and the rules of the Exchange so require, the Company will notify the Exchange that the Special Mandatory
Redemption has occurred and any relevant details relating to such Special Mandatory Redemption.

In addition, the conditions applicable to a Special Mandatory Redemption may be waived or modified by Holders
representing a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

**Note Guarantees**

**_General_**

On the Issue Date, the obligations of the Company under the Notes and the Indenture will be, jointly and
severally, unconditionally guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis (the “Note Guarantees”) by the Initial
Guarantors. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, within 150 days from the Acquisition Closing Date and
substantially concurrently with the guarantees granted in favor of obligations under the Senior Facilities
Agreement, the Notes are expected to be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by thyssenkrupp Elevator
Corp., thyssenkrupp Aufzüge GmbH, Tepper Aufzüge GmbH, thyssenkrupp Elevator (Canada) Limited.,
thyssenkrupp Elevator Manufacturing Inc., thyssenkrupp Stairlifts B.V., and SkyLift B.V. (the “Post-Closing
_Guarantors”). The Senior Facilities will be guaranteed on a senior basis by each Post-Closing Guarantor. In_
addition, the Original Guarantee Facility and the Original Revolving Credit Facility made available under the
Senior Facilities Agreement will be guaranteed by thyssenkrupp Elevadores, S.L.U. which is barred from
granting a guarantee of the Senior Term Facilities and a Note Guarantee pursuant to Spanish financial assistance
laws. In addition, if required by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees
of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries” and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security
Principles, certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Note Guarantee in the future and accede to the
Intercreditor Agreement. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2020, on a consolidated basis and excluding
statistical corporate cost allocations, the Post-Closing Guarantors generated 62.8% of the Target Group’s
consolidated EBITDA and 44.5% of the Target Group’s consolidated sales. As of March 31, 2020, on a
consolidated basis and excluding the value of the “thyssenkrupp” brand (the license for which will automatically
terminate 18 months after the Acquisition Closing Date), the Post-Closing Guarantors accounted for 36.4% of the
Target Group’s consolidated assets.

The obligations of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would
not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law to comply with corporate benefit,
financial assistance and other laws. In addition, the Note Guarantees will be further limited as required under the
Agreed Security Principles as described below under “Security—General.” The Agreed Security Principles apply
to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the
Secured Notes and the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees
where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or
requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent preference rules, “thin capitalization”
rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims and similar matters, or where the time and cost of
granting the guarantee would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders. By virtue of these
limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable
with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee. For
example, due to Spanish financial assistance laws thyssenkrupp Elevadores, S.L.U. is barred from granting a
guarantee of the Senior Term Facilities and a Note Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Each Series
of Notes—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Note

339


-----

Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the
Collateral” and “—The insolvency laws of Germany and other applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable to
you as the insolvency laws of the United States or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other
limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests (as defined herein), including fraudulent
conveyance statutes, may adversely affect their validity and enforceability.” The validity and enforceability of
the Note Guarantees and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in “Certain
Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and
Security Interests.”

The Company is a holding company and its only material assets are its interests in the capital and loan stock of
its Subsidiaries. As such, the Company will be dependent upon the Restricted Subsidiaries to make payments to it
to service interest, principal and other payments on the Notes.

A significant portion of the operations of the Company will be conducted through Subsidiaries that are not
expected to become Guarantors, including Subsidiaries exempt from becoming Guarantors or having security
granted over their shares or assets under the Agreed Security Principles. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantors,
including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those
Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries and claims against
joint ventures generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries and joint
ventures over the claims of creditors of the Company and the Guarantors, including Holders. The Notes and each
Note Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred
and minority stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Company (other than the Guarantors) and joint ventures.
Although the Indenture limits the incurrence of Indebtedness (including Disqualified Stock, and Preferred Stock
of Restricted Subsidiaries), the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the
Indenture does not impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not
considered Indebtedness under the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

**_Subordination of the Note Guarantees_**

The Note Guarantees will be senior subordinated indebtedness, which means that, pursuant to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture, the Note Guarantees will rank behind, and will be expressly
subordinated to, all the existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantors, including any obligations
under the Senior Facilities, the Secured Notes and any future Indebtedness ranking pari passu therewith. As a
result of this subordination, holders of Senior Indebtedness of any Guarantor will be entitled to receive full
payment on all obligations owed to them before any payment can be made to Holders of the Notes in respect of
such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee. The ability to take enforcement action against the Guarantors is subject to
significant restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement, and potentially any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements entered into after the Issue Date. For example, the ability of the Trustee or the Holders to take
enforcement action with respect to the Note Guarantees will be subject to certain standstill provisions and
payment blockage and other limitations on enforcement. The Trustee and the Holders will not be able to enforce
the Note Guarantees until the expiration of the applicable standstill period (generally 179 days) for so long as
amounts under Senior Indebtedness remain outstanding. In addition, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral
securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be subject to release under certain circumstances, including, but
not limited to, the sale of Midco pursuant to an enforcement of security over shares of Midco taken by the
Security Agent acting at the direction of an instructing group of senior secured creditors. Because of the
foregoing subordination provisions, it is likely that holders of Senior Indebtedness and other creditors (including
trade creditors) of the Guarantors would recover disproportionately more than the holders of the Notes recover in
any insolvency or similar proceeding relating to such entity. In any such case, there may be insufficient assets, or
no assets, remaining to pay the principal of or interest on the Notes after the repayment in full of all Senior
Indebtedness. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Senior Notes—Your right to receive payment under the
Senior Note Guarantees is contractually subordinated to senior ranking debt of the Guarantors.”

**_Note Guarantee Releases_**

The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon:

(1) a direct or indirect sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including by way of merger, amalgamation,
consolidation, dividend distribution or otherwise) of (i) the Capital Stock of such Guarantor (as a result of
which such Guarantor would no longer be a Restricted Subsidiary), or (ii) all or substantially all the assets
of the Guarantor, to a Person other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary and otherwise in
compliance with the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(2) the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

340


-----

(3) legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes and the Indenture, as
provided in “— Defeasance” and “— Satisfaction and Discharge;”

(4) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(5) upon the release or discharge of the Guarantee and any other obligations of such Guarantor under the Senior
Facilities Agreement, provided that (i) as of the next applicable test date after giving effect to such release
and any applicable clean-up period, the Guarantor Coverage Test (as defined in the Senior Facilities
Agreement) is met, calculated in accordance with, and in the manner provided by and subject to the same
exceptions as those set forth in the Senior Facilities Agreement as in effect on the Acquisition Closing Date
and (ii) such Guarantor also releases its Note Guarantee under the Secured Notes and the Private Notes;

(6) as described in the second paragraph of the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(7) upon the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of any Guarantor with and into the Company or another
Guarantor or upon the liquidation of such Guarantor, in each case, in compliance with the covenant under
“—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”;

(8) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization;

(9) upon the achievement of Investment Grade Status by the Notes; and

(10) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers.”

The Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, shall, subject to receipt of certain documentation requested
pursuant to the Indenture, take all necessary actions at the reasonable request and cost of the Company, including
the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
to effectuate any release of a Note Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary
protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee without the
consent of the Holders and will not require any other action or consent on the part of the Trustee. Neither the
Trustee nor the Company will be required to make a notation on the Notes to reflect any such release, termination
or discharge. The Company may in its sole discretion elect to have any Note Guarantee remain in place, as
opposed to being released.

**Security**

**_General_**

On the Issue Date, the Notes and the Note Guarantees in respect thereof will be secured on a first-priority basis
by the Escrow Charges. Upon receipt by the Trustee of either an Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate or a notice
of Special Mandatory Redemption, the Escrowed Property will be released and the first-priority security interests
over the Escrowed Property will automatically be released and terminate. In addition, the Notes and the Note
Guarantees in respect thereof will be secured on the Issue Date (collectively, the “Collateral”):

- on a first-priority basis by: (i) a share pledge in respect of Parentco’s shares in the capital of the Company
pursuant to a German law governed share pledge agreement; (ii) a security assignment in respect of any
structural intercompany receivables owed to Parentco by the Company pursuant to a German law governed
security assignment agreement; and (iii) a pledge in respect of the Company’s material bank accounts in
Germany (without control over use and freely operational prior to acceleration) pursuant to a German law
governed bank account pledge agreement (collectively, the “Topco Independent Collateral”); and

- on a second-priority basis by: (i) a share pledge in respect of the Company’s shares in the capital of Midco
pursuant to a German law governed share pledge agreement; and (ii) a security assignment in respect of any
structural intercompany receivables owed to the Company by Midco pursuant to a German law governed
security assignment agreement (collectively, the “Topco Shared Collateral”).

The Collateral will also secure the Private Notes, and may also secure any Additional Notes, as well as certain
future Indebtedness, on a pari passu basis. The Topco Shared Collateral will also secure the Senior Facilities and
the Secured Notes, and may also secure certain Hedging Obligations and certain future Indebtedness, on a firstpriority basis. The Notes will not benefit from any security interests in the Post-Closing Collateral (as defined
under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes”).

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—
Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the Company and the
Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with future issuances
of Indebtedness or Indebtedness of the Restricted Subsidiaries, including, subject to certain requirements
described herein, Additional Notes, as permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

341


-----

The Collateral (other than the Escrow Charge) will be granted to the Security Agent on behalf of the Holders and
holders of the other secured obligations that are secured by the Collateral pursuant to the Topco Security
Documents. Any other assets subject to Security Interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations
under the Notes, any Note Guarantees and the Indenture would also constitute “Collateral.” All Collateral will be
subject to the limitations that are applicable to Note Guarantees granted by the same entity, the operation of the
Agreed Security Principles and any Permitted Collateral Liens.

The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the
Holders. No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with the offering of the Notes. By its
nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value.
Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. The proceeds from the
enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders. See “Risk
Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—The value of the Collateral securing the Notes may not be sufficient to
satisfy our obligations under the Notes and such Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain
circumstances.”

The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or imposed
by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent
conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital
maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other
considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations, see “Certain Insolvency Law
Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security
Interests.”

Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of the covenant described below under “—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” certain property, rights and assets may not be pledged, and any pledge over
property, rights and assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed Security
Principles. The following is a non-exhaustive summary of certain terms of the Agreed Security Principles, which
include, among others:

- general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance, anti-trust and other
competition authority restrictions, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, equitable subordination,
“transfer pricing”, “thin capitalization”, “earnings stripping”, “controlled foreign corporation” and other tax
restrictions, “exchange control restrictions”, “capital maintenance” rules and “liquidity impairment” rules,
tax restrictions, retention of title claims, employee consultation or approval requirements and similar
principles may limit the ability of a member of the Group to provide a guarantee or security or may require
that the guarantee or security be limited as to amount or otherwise and, if so, the guarantee or security will
be limited accordingly provided that, to the extent requested by the Security Agent before signing any
applicable security or accession document, the relevant member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavors
(but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to
overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or security document shall be subject to such limit;

- a key factor in determining whether or not (and the terms on which) a guarantee or security will be taken
(and in respect of the security, the extent of its perfection and/or registration) is the applicable time and cost
(including adverse effects on taxes, interest deductibility, stamp duty, registration costs and taxes, notarial
costs, translation costs and all applicable legal fees and adverse effects on the ability of the Group to obtain
or maintain local facilities or other financing arrangements, including any factoring or similar arrangement
in each case permitted under the Indenture) which will not be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the
secured parties of obtaining such guarantee or security;

- members of the Group will not be required to give guarantees or enter into security documents if they are
not wholly owned by another member of the Group or if it is not within the legal capacity of the relevant
members of the Group or if it would conflict with the fiduciary or statutory duties of their officers or
contravene any applicable legal, regulatory or contractual prohibition or restriction or have the potential to
result in a material risk of personal or criminal liability for any officer of or for any member of the Group;
_provided that, to the extent requested by the Security Agent before signing any applicable security document_
or accession document, the relevant member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavors (but without
incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such
obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or security document shall be subject to such limit;

- guarantees and security will be limited so that the aggregate of notarial costs and all registration and like
taxes and duties relating to the provision of security will not exceed an amount to be agreed between the
Company and the Security Agent;

342


-----

- where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of granting security
over the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such security, security will be granted over
the material assets only;

- it is expressly acknowledged that it may be either impossible or impractical to create security over certain
categories of assets in which event security will not be taken over such assets;

- any asset subject to a legal requirement, contract, lease, license, instrument, regulatory constraint (including
any agreement with any government or regulatory body) or other third party arrangement (other than
restrictions contained in the constitutional documents of a member of the Group or in any intra-Group loan
agreement), which may prevent or condition the asset from being charged, secured or being subject to the
applicable security document (including requiring a consent of any third party, supervisory board or works
council (or equivalent)) and any asset which, if subject to the applicable security document, would give a
third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations with respect to
any member of the Group in respect of the asset or require the relevant chargor to take any action materially
adverse to the interests of the Group or any member thereof, in each case will be excluded from a guarantee
or security document;

- the giving of a guarantee, the granting of security and the registration and/or the perfection of the security
granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the relevant member
of the Group to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course as otherwise permitted by the
Finance Documents (as defined in the section entitled “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
Intercreditor Agreement” above) (including dealing with the secured assets and all contractual
counterparties or amending, waiving or terminating (or allowing to lapse) any rights, benefits or obligations,
in each case prior to an Acceleration Event (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) which is continuing),
and any requirement under the Agreed Security Principles to seek consent of any person or take or not take
any other action shall be subject to the Agreed Security Principles;

- any security document will only be required to be notarized if required by law in order for the relevant
security to become effective or admissible in evidence;

- no guarantee or security will be required to be given by or over any acquired person or asset (and no consent
shall be required to be sought with respect thereto) which are required to support Acquired Indebtedness to
the extent such Acquired Indebtedness is permitted by the Indenture to remain outstanding after an
acquisition. No member of a target group or other entity acquired pursuant to an acquisition permitted by the
Indenture shall be required to become a Guarantor or grant security with respect to the Notes if prevented by
the terms of the documentation governing that acquired indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness or
any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of such Acquired Indebtedness) or if becoming a Guarantor or the
granting of any security would give rise to an obligation (including any payment obligation) under or in
relation thereto; no security will be granted over any asset secured for the benefit of any debt permitted by
the Indenture and/or to the extent constituting a Permitted Lien unless specifically required by a Finance
Document to the contrary;

- no title investigations or other diligence on assets will be required and no title insurance will be required;

- security will not be required over any assets subject to security in favor of a third party (other than in
relation to security under general business conditions of account banks which do not prohibit or prevent the
creation of security over such accounts) or any cash constituting regulatory capital or customer cash (and
such assets or cash shall be excluded from any relevant security document);

- to the extent legally effective, all security will be given in favor of the Security Agent and not the secured
creditors individually (with the Security Agent to hold one set of security documents for all secured parties);
“parallel debt” provisions will be used where necessary (and included in the Intercreditor Agreement and
not the individual security documents); no member of the Group will be required to take any action in
relation to any guarantees or security as a result of any assignment or transfer by a secured party;

- guarantees and security will not be required from or over the assets of, any joint venture or similar
arrangement, any minority interest or any member of the Group that is not wholly-owned by another
member of the Group;

- each security document shall be deemed not to restrict or condition any transaction permitted under the
Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement and the security granted under each security document shall be
deemed to be subject to these Agreed Security Principles, before and after the execution of the relevant
security document and creation of the relevant security;

343


-----

- no security may be provided on terms which are inconsistent with the turnover or sharing provisions in the
Intercreditor Agreement;

- the secured parties (or any agent or similar representative appointed by them at the relevant time) will not be
able to exercise any power of attorney or set-off granted to them under the terms of the Finance Documents
prior to the occurrence of an Acceleration Event which is continuing;

- no guarantee or security shall guarantee or secure any “Excluded Swap Obligations” defined in accordance
with the LSTA Market Advisory Update dated February 15, 2013 entitled “Swap Regulations’ Implications
for Loan Documentation”, and any update thereto by the LSTA;

- other than a general filing relating to a floating charge or blanket lien, no perfection, filing or other action
will be required with respect to assets of a type not owned by members of the Group or not in Australia,
Canada, any member state of the EU, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Switzerland, the
United Kingdom and the United States (including any state thereof and the District of Columbia) (each, a
“Guarantor Jurisdiction”) or otherwise over the shares of a member of the Group not located in a Guarantor
Jurisdiction;

- no translation of any document relating to any security or any asset subject to any security will be required
to be prepared or provided to the secured parties, unless (i) required for such documents to become effective
or admissible in evidence and (ii) an Acceleration Event is continuing; and

- no security shall be provided to the extent it would constitute or may constitute unlawful financial assistance
within the meaning of articles 143 or 150 (as applicable) of the Spanish Companies Act or any equivalent
provision of any other applicable law.

The Agreed Security Principles with respect to the Notes will be interpreted and applied in good faith by the
Company.

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the Topco Security
Documents (the “Security Interests” and each, a “Security Interest”) as between (a) the lenders under the Senior
Facilities Agreement, (b) the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations, (c) the Trustee, the Security
Agent and the Holders under the Secured Notes Indenture, (d) the trustee, the Security Agent and the holders
under the Private Notes Indenture, (e) the trustee, the Security Agent and the holders under the Indenture and
(e) the creditors of certain other Indebtedness (including Indebtedness that may be Incurred in the future)
permitted to be secured by such Collateral, respectively, will be established by the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, which will provide, among other things, that (i) the obligations under the Senior Facilities
Agreement, the Secured Notes and certain Hedging Obligations and the guarantees thereof are secured equally
and ratably by, among other things, first-priority Security Interests in the Topco Shared Collateral and (ii) the
Notes and the Private Notes and the guarantees thereof are secured equally and ratably by first-priority Security
Interests in the Independent Topco Collateral and second-priority Security Interests in the Topco Shared
Collateral. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders will receive proceeds from the
enforcement of, or certain distressed disposals of, the (y) Independent Topco Collateral on a pari passu basis
with all indebtedness of the Company that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and (z) the Topco
Shared Collateral only after any existing or future Indebtedness with a prior-ranking Lien on such Topco Shared
Collateral is repaid in full, including the Senior Facilities, the Secured Notes and certain Hedging Obligations.
See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement restricts the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes to instruct
the Security Agent to take enforcement action. The circumstances in which the holders of the Notes may instruct
the Security Agent to take enforcement action in respect of the Security Interests over the Topco Shared
Collateral are significantly limited. Generally, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the holders of firstranking security interests in the Topco Shared Collateral will be entitled to control virtually all decisions relating
to the exercise of remedies with respect to these security interests, will be able to block enforcement of such
security interests, will be able to release the security interests constituting Topco Shared Collateral in certain
circumstances and will receive any proceeds from the enforcement of those security interests before amounts will
be available to the holders of the Notes.

In general, the rights of the Security Agent (acting on its own behalf or on behalf of the holders of the Notes) to
take enforcement action under the Security Documents with respect to the Topco Shared Collateral are subject to
certain standstill provisions and payment blockage and other limitations on enforcement. The Trustee and the
holders of the Notes may only act through the Security Agent and will not be able to independently pursue the

344


-----

remedies of a secured creditor under the Security Documents or until the expiration of the applicable standstill
period (being a period of up to 179 days subject to certain exceptions) and for so long as any amounts under the
Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes, certain Hedging Obligations and any such other Senior
Indebtedness or obligations remain outstanding, force a sale of such Topco Shared Collateral. See “Description
of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.”

**_Security Documents_**

Under the Topco Security Documents, the Company and Parentco will grant security over the Collateral to secure
the payment when due of the Company’s and the Guarantors’ payment obligations under the Notes, the Note
Guarantees and the Indenture. The Topco Security Documents will be entered into by the relevant security
provider and the Security Agent as agent for the secured parties. When entering into such Topco Security
Documents, the Security Agent will act in its own name, but for the benefit of the secured parties (including
itself, the Trustee and the Holders from time to time). Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent also
acts as an agent of the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the holders of the Secured Notes and the
counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations in relation to the Security Interests created in favor of such
parties.

In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of Security
Interests, the relevant Topco Security Documents will secure “parallel debt” obligations created under the
Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent (and not the obligations under the Notes and the Note
Guarantees). The parallel debt construct has not been fully tested under the law in certain of these jurisdictions.
See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—The security interests in the Notes Collateral will be granted to
the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce
the Notes Collateral may be restricted by local law.”

Each Escrow Charge shall be granted solely for the benefit of the Trustee on behalf of the Holders of the
applicable series of Notes, and no other persons (including for the avoidance of doubt any lender under the
Senior Facilities Agreement, any holder of Secured Notes or Private Notes, counterparties under any Hedging
Obligations or any other creditors) shall be entitled to benefit from the Escrow Charges.

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, only
the Security Agent will have the right to enforce the Topco Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee and the
Holders. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, Holders will not be entitled to take enforcement action
in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee under the Indenture, who will (subject
to the provisions of the Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent. In addition, prior to the discharge
of obligations under the Senior Facilities, the Secured Notes, certain Hedging Obligations and other obligations
constituting priority indebtedness under the Intercreditor Agreement, the representatives of the Holders will be
subject to a 179-day standstill on the taking of any enforcement action over the Topco Shared Collateral. See
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Topco Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes and the Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by Security Interests in the
Collateral until all obligations under the Notes and the Indenture have been discharged. However, the Security
Interests with respect to the Notes and the Indenture may be released under certain circumstances as provided
under “—Security—Release of Liens.”

In the event that the Company or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the
Security Interests created under the Topco Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in the
Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the Security
Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement was successful, the Holders may not be able to recover any
amounts under the Topco Security Documents. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—The granting of
the Guarantees and security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the incurrence of permitted
debt in the future, may create or restart hardening or voidance periods for such security interests in accordance
with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions.”

**_Enforcement of Security Interest_**

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will restrict the ability of the Holders or the Trustee to enforce the
Security Interests and provide for the release of the Security Interests created by the Topco Security Documents
in certain circumstances upon enforcement by the Security Agent in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement. These limitations are described under “Description of Certain Financing
Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the

345


-----

Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests.” The ability to enforce may also be
restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral in
compliance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The creditors under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Secured Notes, the Private Notes, the counterparties to
Hedging Obligations secured by the Collateral and the Trustee have and, by accepting a Note as described below,
each Holder will be deemed to have, appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent under the Intercreditor
Agreement and the security documents securing such Indebtedness.

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**

The Indenture will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, will be deemed (without any further consent of
the Holders) to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Topco Security Documents and
perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Topco Security Documents securing such Indebtedness, together with any
other incidental rights, power and discretions;

(2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements and the Topco Security Documents; and

(3) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and comply with
the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Topco
Security Documents (including the execution of, and compliance with, any waiver, modification,
amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Trustee or the Security Agent on its
behalf).

See the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—The security interests in the Notes
Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the
Security Agent to enforce the Notes Collateral may be restricted by local law.”

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as
defined below) entered into in compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional
Intercreditor Agreements.”

**_Release of Liens_**

Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, release of the
Security Interests in respect of the Collateral will be permitted under any one or more of the following
circumstances:

(1) other than the Liens over the Capital Stock of the Company, in connection with any sale or other disposition
of Collateral to (a) a Person that is not the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any
transaction subject to “—Merger and Consolidation”), if such sale or other disposition does not violate the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” and
is otherwise not prohibited by the Indenture or (b) any Restricted Subsidiary; provided that this clause 1(b)
shall not be relied upon in the case of a transfer of Capital Stock or of accounts receivable (including
intercompany loan receivables and hedging receivables) to a Restricted Subsidiary (except to a
Securitization Subsidiary) unless the relevant property and assets remain subject to, or otherwise become
subject to, a Lien in favor of the Notes following such sale or disposal;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Note Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the
release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

(3) as described under “Amendments and Waivers” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or legal defeasance,
covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided in “Defeasance” and
“Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(5) if the Company designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such
Unrestricted Subsidiary, and the release of any assets designated by the Company as Receivables Assets in
connection with a Receivables Facility;

346


-----

(6) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization; or

(7) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture.

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Topco Security Documents will be released (a) in accordance
with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) as may be permitted by the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.” For the avoidance of doubt,
Liens in respect of Specified Assets will be released in connection with a Specified Asset Disposition.

The Security Interests over the assets subject to the Escrow Charges will be released upon the occurrence of the
Escrow Release or in connection with the Special Mandatory Redemption.

The Security Agent and the Trustee (but only if required) will take all necessary action reasonably requested by,
and at the cost of, the Company to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Notes and the Note
Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Topco Security Document. Each of the releases set forth above shall be
effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee (unless
action is required by it to effect such release). The Security Agent and the Trustee shall be entitled to request and
rely solely upon an Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel, each certifying which circumstance, as
described above, giving rise to a release of the Security Interests has occurred, and that such release complies
with the Indenture; provided, however, that with respect to the release of the Security Interests over the assets
subject to the Escrow Charge, the Trustee shall be entitled to additionally receive (i) in connection with the
Escrow Release, an Officer’s Certificate (which may, at the Company’s option, be the Escrow Release Officer’s
Certificate) certifying satisfaction of the conditions for the Escrow Release and (ii) in connection with the Special
Mandatory Redemption, a notice of the Special Mandatory Redemption.

**IPO Debt Pushdown**

On or following a public equity offering (an “IPO Event”) (or in contemplation of an IPO Event with respect to
the release of security if required to implement such IPO Event), Midco shall be entitled to require (by written
notice to the trustee under the Secured Notes Indenture (a “Pushdown Notice”)) that the terms of the Debt
Documents shall operate (with effect from the date specified in the relevant Pushdown Notice (the “Pushdown
_Date”)) as described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—IPO Debt Pushdown.”_

For the purpose of this covenant, the “IPO Pushdown Entity” shall be any Restricted Subsidiary of Midco or a
Parent Entity of Midco notified to the trustee under the Secured Notes Indenture by Midco in writing as the
Person to be treated as the IPO Pushdown Entity in relation to the relevant IPO Event; provided, that the IPO
Pushdown Entity shall be a Restricted Subsidiary of Midco which will issue shares, or whose shares are to be
sold, pursuant to that IPO Event (or a parent entity of such Restricted Subsidiary) and, provided further, that
(a) if the Topco Notes (including the Notes) are not refinanced in full on or before the Pushdown Date, this
section “IPO Debt Pushdown” shall operate such that (i) for the purposes of the Topco Group (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement) or Topco Liabilities (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), the Topco Borrower
(as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) shall be the IPO Pushdown Entity as determined by the first clause of
the first paragraph under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—IPO Debt Pushdown” and the Topco Group
(and all related provisions) shall comprise that IPO Pushdown Entity and its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to
time; and (ii) for the purposes of Midco and its Restricted Subsidiaries or Liabilities (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement) other than the Topco Liabilities (and all related provisions) references to the “IPO
Pushdown Entity” shall be construed as reference to the direct Subsidiary of the IPO Pushdown Entity, as
determined by the first clause of the first paragraph under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—IPO Debt
Pushdown,” and its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time; or (b) if the Topco Notes (including the Notes)
have been refinanced in full on or before the Pushdown Date but the Secured Notes have not been refinanced in
full on or before the Pushdown Date, Midco shall be the IPO Pushdown Entity.

_Other Redemptions Terms_

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for any series of Notes, including a Change of
Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes of such series validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the
Company, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Company, purchases all of the Notes
validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Company or such third party will have the right upon
not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase date,
to redeem all Notes of such series, in whole or in part, that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price
equal to the price offered to each other Holder (excluding any early tender or incentive fee) in such tender offer
plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts,
if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the date of such redemption. Without prejudice to any provision of the
Indenture regarding Notes deemed not be outstanding for voting purposes if held by the Company or its
Affiliates, in determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes of a series have validly tendered and not validly withdrawn Notes in a tender offer, including a
Change of Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, Notes owned by an Affiliate of the Company or by funds
controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the Company, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be
outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer and such determination.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below.

Notice of any redemption (other than a Special Mandatory Redemption) of the Notes may, at the Company’s
discretion, be given prior to the completion of a transaction (including an Equity Offering, an incurrence of
Indebtedness, a Change of Control, an Asset Disposition or other transaction) and any redemption notice may, at
the Company’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to,
completion of a related transaction. If such redemption or purchase is so subject to satisfaction of one or more
conditions precedent, such notice shall describe each such condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the
Company’s discretion, the redemption or repurchase date may be delayed until such time (including more than
60 days after the date the notice of redemption or offer to purchase was sent) as any or all such conditions shall
be satisfied (or waived by the Company in its sole discretion), or such redemption or purchase may not occur and
such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived
by the Company in its sole discretion) by the redemption or purchase date, or by the redemption or purchase date
as so delayed, or that such notice may be rescinded at any time in the Company’s sole discretion if the Company
determines that any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied or waived. In addition, the Company may
provide in such notice that payment of the redemption or purchase price and performance of the Company’s
obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person.

The Company may redeem Notes pursuant to one or more of the relevant provisions in the Indenture, and a
single notice of redemption may be delivered with respect to redemptions made pursuant to different provisions.
Any such notice may provide that redemptions made pursuant to different provisions will have different
redemption dates.

If the optional redemption date is on or after a record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment
date, the accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date will be paid on the redemption
date to the Holder in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date in accordance
with the applicable procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, and no additional interest will be payable to
Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Company.

Unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or
portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

**Mandatory Redemption or Sinking Fund**

Except as described under the caption “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,” the Company is
not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.
However, under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to offer to purchase Notes as described
under “—Change of Control” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitations on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock.”
As market conditions warrant, we and our equity holders, including the Permitted Holders, their respective
Affiliates and members of our management, may from time to time seek to purchase our outstanding debt
securities or loans, including the Notes or derivative instruments related thereto, in privately negotiated or open
market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Subject to any applicable limitations contained in the
agreements governing our indebtedness, including the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, any purchases made by us may be funded by the use of cash on our balance sheet or the
incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt, including borrowings under our credit facilities. The amounts
involved in any such purchase transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Any such
purchases may be with respect to a substantial amount of a particular class or series of debt, with the attendant
reduction in the trading liquidity of such class or series.

**Selection and Notice**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount
received by them in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection
with the redemption of such Book Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof).

Under the existing practices of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Euro Fixed Rate Notes
or the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes, as applicable, are to be redeemed at any time, DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream
will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a pro rata basis (such as by way of a pool factor), by lot or
on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate and in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC,
Euroclear and Clearstream; provided, however, that no Book Entry Interest of less than €100,000 principal
amount with respect to Euro Fixed Rate Notes and less than $200,000 principal amount with respect to Dollar
Fixed Rate Notes may be redeemed in part. If the Notes are not held through DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream,
the Notes will be selected on a pro rata basis, subject to adjustments so that no Note in an unauthorized
denomination remains outstanding after such redemption; provided, however, that no Euro Fixed Rate Note of
€100,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part and only Euro Fixed Rate Notes in
integral multiples of €1,000 shall be redeemed and that no Dollar Fixed Rate Note of $200,000 in aggregate
principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part and only Dollar Fixed Rate Notes in integral multiples of
$1,000 shall be redeemed. The Trustee, the Paying Agents and the Registrar shall not be liable for selections
made under this paragraph.

Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at least 10
days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at the address
of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of
DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, except that redemption notices may be delivered electronically or mailed more
than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a legal or covenant defeasance
of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture.

If and for so long as any Notes are listed on the Exchange and if and to the extent the rules of the Exchange so
require, the Company will notify the Exchange of any such notice to the Holders of the Notes and, in connection
with any redemption, the Company will notify the Exchange of any change in the principal amount of Notes
outstanding.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the portion
of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case a portion of the original Note will be issued in the
name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. In the case of a global note, an appropriate
notation will be made on such Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the
unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice (including any conditions
contained therein), Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the
redemption date, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest ceases to accrue
on Notes or portions of them called for redemption.

Except as otherwise required under the Indenture, the Company may elect to redeem or repurchase one or more
series of Notes or a portion of a series of Notes without redeeming any other series of Notes.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Company may redeem the Euro Fixed Rate Notes or Dollar Fixed Rate Notes, as applicable, in whole, but
not in part, at any time at its discretion upon giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice to
the Holders (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount
thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax
_Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on_
the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts, as defined below under “Withholding Taxes,” if
any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise,
if the Company determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations, official guidance or rulings
promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below under “—Withholding
Taxes”) affecting taxation; or

(2) any amendment to, or change in an official application, administration or written interpretation of such laws,
treaties, regulations, official guidance or rulings (including by reason of a holding, judgment or order by a
court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) (each of the foregoing in
clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

a Payor (as defined below under “—Withholding Taxes”) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the
applicable series of Notes would be, required to pay Additional Amounts (or increased Additional Amounts) with
respect to the applicable series of Notes (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such
requirement cannot be made by the Company or a Guarantor who can make such payment without the obligation
to pay Additional Amounts), and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to
the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be
reasonable). Such Change in Tax Law must be formally announced and become effective on or after the Issue
Date (or if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the
Issue Date, such later date). The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such
Guarantor is obliged to make at least one payment on the Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor
Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law
occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under
“Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given earlier than
60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of Additional
Amounts. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the
Company will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption
and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right to so redeem have been
satisfied and that the obligation to pay Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the relevant Payor taking
reasonable measures available to it (but in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such
requirement cannot be made by the Company or another Guarantor who can make such payment without the
obligation to pay Additional Amounts) and (b) a written opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized
standing qualified under the laws of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and satisfactory to the Trustee (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld) to the effect that the Payor has been or will become obligated to pay
Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely
conclusively on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions
precedent described above, without liability or further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding
on the Holders.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Company or any Guarantor (including any successor entity) (each, a
“Payor”) in respect of the Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee, as applicable, will be made free and clear
of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of
such Taxes is then required by law or by the relevant taxing authority’s interpretation or administration thereof. If
any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or Note Guarantee is made by or on
behalf of any Payor or the Paying Agent or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or
therein having the power to tax (including the jurisdiction of the Paying Agent); or

351


-----

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes,
or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental
authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing
_Jurisdiction”),_

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor or the
Paying Agent with respect to any Note or any Note Guarantee, including (without limitation) payments of
principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such
additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in
respect of such payments, after such withholding or deduction (including any such withholding or deduction
from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been received in respect of
such payments on any such Note or Note Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided,
_however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:_

(1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or
former connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member,
partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an estate,
nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
(including, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a
business or maintaining a permanent establishment in or place of management present in, or being
physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising
solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise
or enforcement of rights under such Note, the Indenture or a Note Guarantee;

(2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the
beneficial owner of the Note to comply with a reasonable written request of the Payor addressed to the
Holder or beneficial owner, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such withholding or
deduction would be payable), to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning
the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or
similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a law,
statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to
exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, all or part of such Tax, but, in each case, only to the extent the
Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to do so;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed as a result of the presentation of the Note for payment
(where Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and presentation is required) more than 30 days
after the later of the applicable payment date or the date the relevant payment is first made available for
payment to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts
had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period);

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment with respect to the
Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(6) any Taxes imposed, deducted or withheld pursuant to section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the “Code”) or otherwise imposed pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code,
in each case, as of the Issue Date (and any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable),
any current or future regulations or agreements thereunder, official interpretations thereof or similar law or
regulation implementing an intergovernmental agreement relating thereto;

(7) any U.S. federal back-up withholding tax under section 3406 of the Code; or

(8) any combination of the items (1) through (7) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or
any Person other than the beneficial owner of the Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settler with respect
to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to
Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner held such Notes directly.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the relevant tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will provide certified copies
of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of such other
reasonable evidence as is available of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee (with a

352


-----

copy to the Paying Agent). Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will
be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment made on any Note or any Note
Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying
Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated
to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts on
the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the
relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable
after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to
conclusively rely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Senior Notes” there is mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of the Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Note Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context,
Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay and reimburse each applicable Holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration,
court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect
thereto) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest
or penalties with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, issuance,
delivery, registration, enforcement of, or receipt of payments with respect to any Notes, any Note Guarantee, the
Indenture, or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (in each case, other than in connection with a
transfer after this offering) and limited, solely to the extent of such taxes or similar charges or levies that arise
from the receipt of any payments of principal or interest on the Notes, to any such taxes or similar charges or
levies that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (3) and (5) through (8) (save that in respect of clause (5),
this proviso shall not apply in connection with transfer, personal property or similar Taxes).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any transfer by
a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a
Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes,
or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to the Notes (or any Note
Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such successor Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or
agency thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless a (i) third party makes a Change of Control
Offer or (ii) the Company previously or substantially concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice with
respect to all the outstanding Notes as described in the seventh paragraph under this heading “—Change of
Control,” the Company will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes (provided that Euro Fixed Rate Notes of
€100,000 or less in principal amount, and Dollar Fixed Rate Notes of $200,000 or less in principal amount, may
only be redeemed in whole and not in part) pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”)
at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the date of repurchase; provided that if the repurchase date is on or
after the record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment date, then Holders in whose name the
Notes are registered at the close of business on such record date will receive interest on the repurchase date.
Within 60 days following any Change of Control, the Company will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of
such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes at the address of such
Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC,
Euroclear and Clearstream, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and
offering to repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date
will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the
procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of
Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control as described below.

353


-----

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable
securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the
Indenture by virtue thereof. The Company may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the
staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that
permit the Holders to require that the Company repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover,
recapitalization or similar transaction.

The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control may constitute a default under the Senior
Facilities Agreement that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder and trigger the
Change of Control offer requirement under the Secured Notes Indenture, the Private Notes Indenture and other
financing arrangements of a Parent Entity. Future Indebtedness of the Company or its subsidiaries may contain
prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be
repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the
Company to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control
itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Company. There can be no assurance that
sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases.

The Company’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may
be limited by their then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when
necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain
circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent
management.

Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Company could, in the future, enter into certain transactions,
including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control
under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise
affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are
contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the
Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in
such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders
protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.

The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i) a third
party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and
purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of
redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described under “—Optional
Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable
redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in
the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of
Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of
case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under
applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a
particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and
whether a Holder of Notes may require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described
above.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes
as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules
of the Exchange so require, the Company will notify the Exchange of any Change of Control Offer.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that will be contained in the Indenture. For the avoidance of
doubt, the consummation of the Transactions shall not be prohibited by the covenants below under “—Certain
Covenants.”

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

Following the first day:

(a) a series of Notes has achieved Investment Grade Status; and

(b) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture,

(the occurrence of such events, a “Covenant Suspension Event” and the date thereof being referred to as the
“Suspension Date”), then, beginning on the Suspension Date until the occurrence of the Reversion Date (as
defined below), (i) the amount of each basket set by reference to a monetary amount for which a specific amount
is set out in the Indenture and any definitions used therein (including all “annual,” “life of facilities”, “fiscal
year”, “financial year”, “calendar year”, “at any time” and “aggregate” baskets) shall be increased by fifty
(50) per cent and (ii) the covenants specifically listed under the following captions in this offering memorandum
will no longer be applicable to the Notes (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”):

- “—Limitation on Indebtedness;”

- “—Limitation on Restricted Payments;”

- “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock;”

- “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions;”

- the provisions of clause (iv) under “Merger and Consolidation—Company;”

- “— Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries;”

- “—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries;” and

- “—Impairment of Security Interest.”

During any period that the foregoing covenants have been suspended, the Company may not designate any of its
Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. If and while the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not
subject to the Suspended Covenants, the Notes will be entitled to substantially less covenant protection. In the
event that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants under the
Indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”)
the Notes no longer have an Investment Grade Rating or a Rating Agency withdraws its Investment Grade Rating
or downgrades the rating assigned to the relevant series of Notes below an Investment Grade Rating (in each
case, to the extent given an Investment Grade Rating by such Rating Agency), then the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture with
respect to future events. The period of time between the Suspension Date and the Reversion Date is referred to in
this description as the “Suspension Period.” The Note Guarantees will be suspended during the Suspension
Period. Additionally, upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event, the amount of Excess Proceeds from
any Asset Dispositions shall be reset to zero.

During the Suspension Period, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be entitled to incur Liens to the
extent provided for under “—Limitation on Liens” (including, without limitation, Permitted Liens) and any
Permitted Liens which may refer to one or more Suspended Covenants shall be interpreted as though such
applicable Suspended Covenant(s) continued to be applicable during the Suspension Period (but solely for
purposes of the “—Limitation on Liens” covenant and the “Permitted Liens” and “Permitted Collateral Liens”
definitions and for no other covenant).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any such reinstatement, no action taken or omitted to be taken by
the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries prior to such reinstatement will give rise to a Default or Event
of Default under the Indenture, and no Default or Event of Default will be deemed to exist or have occurred as a
result of any failure by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to comply with any of the Suspended
Covenants during the Suspension Period; provided, that (1) with respect to Restricted Payments (as defined
herein) made after such reinstatement, the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments will be calculated
as though the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect
prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period (including with respect to a Applicable Transaction entered into

355


-----

during the Suspension Period); (2) all Indebtedness incurred, committed or issued during the Suspension Period
(or deemed incurred or issued in connection with an Applicable Transaction entered into during the Suspension
Period) will be classified to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (iv)(A) of the second paragraph of
“—Limitation on Indebtedness;” (3) any Affiliate Transaction (as defined herein) entered into after such
reinstatement pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be
permitted pursuant to clause (vi) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
Affiliate Transactions;” (4) any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not
a Guarantor to take any action described in clauses (i) through (iii) of the first paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes
effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (i) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted
Subsidiaries;” (5) no Subsidiary of the Company shall be required to comply with the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries” after such reinstatement with respect to
any guarantee or obligation entered into by such Subsidiary during any Suspension Period; and (6) all
Investments made during the Suspension Period (or deemed made in connection with an Applicable Transaction
entered into during the Suspension Period) will be classified to have been made under clause (i) of the definition
of “Permitted Investments.”

Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated after the Reversion Date, (1) no Default, Event
of Default or breach of any kind will be deemed to exist under the Indenture, the Notes or the Note Guarantees
with respect to the Suspended Covenants, and none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall bear any
liability for any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period, or any actions taken at any time
pursuant to any contractual obligation arising during any Suspension Period, in each case as a result of a failure
to comply with the Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period (or, upon termination of the Suspension
Period or after that time based solely on any action taken or event that occurred during the Suspension Period),
and (2) following a Reversion Date, the Company and each Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted, without
causing a Default or Event of Default, to honor, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments
or obligations arising during any Suspension Period and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.

There can be no assurance that any series of Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Rating.
The Trustee shall be notified of a Covenant Suspension Event. The Trustee shall have no duty to (i) monitor the
ratings of the Notes, (ii) ascertain whether a Covenant Suspension Event or Reversion Date have occurred, or
(iii) notify the Holders of any of the foregoing.

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness); provided that the Company and any of the Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur
Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), if on the Applicable Test Date and after giving pro forma effect
thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), either: (i) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is
at least 2.00:1.00 or (ii) the Total Net Leverage Ratio does not exceed 6.85:1.00.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness (collectively,
“Permitted Debt”):

Facility (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit, guarantees and bankers’ acceptances thereunder)

(2) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is at least 2.00:1.00; plus

(E) the maximum amount of Indebtedness not secured on Collateral or unsecured such that on the

_provided that any Indebtedness or unutilized commitments in respect of Indebtedness Incurred or deemed to_
be Incurred pursuant to this clause (i) may be refinanced at any time if such refinancing does not exceed the
greater of (1) the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred pursuant to this
clause (i) on the Applicable Test Date for such refinancing and (2) the aggregate principal amount of the
Indebtedness or unutilized commitments in respect of Indebtedness being refinanced at such time (together
with an amount necessary to pay accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and expenses (including original

discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred or payable in connection with such refinancing)
and, in the case of a refinancing of Indebtedness under Facility B (EUR), Facility A, Facility B (USD), the
Original Revolving Facility, the Original Guarantee Facility or any additional facilities under the Senior
Facilities Agreement Incurred as at the Acquisition Closing Date, such Indebtedness shall be treated for all
purposes as Incurred pursuant to clause (A)(1), (A)(2), (A)(3) and (A)(4) above, respectively;

outstanding as of the Acquisition Closing Date (and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof) shall
be deemed to have been Incurred pursuant to:

(A) clause (i)(A)(1) above, in the case of Indebtedness under Facility B (EUR);

(B) clause (i)(A)(2), in the case of Indebtedness under Facility A and Facility B (USD);

the Private Notes, as applicable, are lent to the Company,

and the Company shall not be permitted to reclassify all or a portion of such Indebtedness;

(iii) for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness Incurred under a
Credit Facility, re-borrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to a “cash sweep” or “clean down”
provisions or any similar provisions under a Credit Facility that provide that Indebtedness is deemed to have
been repaid periodically shall only be deemed for the purposes of this covenant to have been Incurred on the
date such Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on the date of any subsequent re-borrowing thereof;

(iv) in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, when measuring the outstanding amount of such Indebtedness,
such amount shall not include any amounts necessary to pay the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid
interest and any fees and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees), including
any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses
Incurred or payable in connection with such refinancing;

relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular
amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(vi) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred
pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to the first or the second paragraph
of this covenant and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other
Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

(vii) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred
Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or
repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation
preference thereof;

(viii) in the event that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments under a
revolving credit facility, enters into any commitment to Incur or issue Indebtedness or commits to Incur any
Lien pursuant to clause (cc) of the definition of “Permitted Liens,” the Incurrence or issuance thereof for all
purposes under the Indenture, including for the purposes of calculating any Applicable Metric for
borrowings and reborrowings thereunder (and including issuance and creation of letters of credit and
bankers’ acceptances thereunder) may be determined, at the Company’s option (A) on the date of such
revolving credit facility or such entry into or increase in commitments or (B) on the date on which such
facility or commitments become available or, if applicable, any other Applicable Test Date (assuming, in the
case of (A) and (B) of this clause (viii) that the full amount thereof (or, at the option of the Company, a
portion thereof) has been borrowed as of such date) and, in either case, if any such Applicable Metric is
satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any borrowing or reborrowing thereunder (and the issuance and
creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant
irrespective of the Applicable Metric at the time of any borrowing or reborrowing (or issuance or creation of
letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the committed amount permitted to be borrowed or
reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances) on a date pursuant
to the operation of this clause (viii) but not actually borrowed on such date shall be the “Reserved
_Indebtedness Amount” as of such date for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Senior Secured_
Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable,
and, to the extent of any clause of the second paragraph of this covenant (if any), shall be deemed to be
Incurred and outstanding under such clauses);

-----

(ix) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to
refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on the first paragraph of this covenant or any clause of
the second paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a percentage of LTM EBITDA as of the
Applicable Test Date, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction to be
exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of LTM EBITDA on the Applicable Test Date of such
refinancing, such percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the
principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such
Indebtedness being refinanced, plus the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and
expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees), including any premium and
defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred or payable in
connection with such refinancing; and

(x) except as otherwise specified herein, the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the
principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the
basis of IFRS.

Accrual and/or capitalization of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or
amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the
payment of dividends in the form of additional shares or Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the
reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS, will not be
deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this covenant; provided
that the amount of any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of any outstanding Indebtedness may (in the
Company’s sole discretion) be increased by the amount of all such accrued and/or capitalized interest, accreted
value, original issue discount and/or additional Indebtedness in respect of such Indebtedness and such Increased
Amount will not be deemed to be Indebtedness for the purpose of calculating any basket, permission or threshold
under which such Refinancing Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary
shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not
permitted to be Incurred as of such date under this covenant, the Company shall be in default of this covenant).

For the purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness or liquidation preference of
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant
currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred, or, at the option of the Company,
first committed or first incurred or upon execution of the definitive documentation in respect thereof (whichever
yields the lower Euro Equivalent); provided that, if such determination is made with respect to Indebtedness
Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause
the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in
effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been
exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (x) the principal
amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (y) the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid interest and
any fees and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees), including any premium
and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred or payable in
connection with such refinancing.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company
or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a
result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to
refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be
calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing
Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

The Company will not Incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) that is contractually
subordinated in right of payment to any Senior Indebtedness of the Company unless such Indebtedness is also
contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes on substantially identical terms, and no Guarantor
will Incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) that is contractually subordinated in right of
payment to any Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor unless such Indebtedness ranks pari passu with such
Guarantor’s Note Guarantee or is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantor’s Note
Guarantee on substantially identical terms; provided that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually
subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Company or any Guarantor solely by virtue of
being unsecured or by virtue of being secured with different collateral or by virtue of being secured on a junior

priority basis or by virtue of the application of waterfall or other payment ordering provisions affecting different
tranches of the Notes or where such ranking or subordination arises as a matter of law.

made pursuant to this clause (xxviii) shall reduce the amount which may be Incurred under clause (xxi) of
the second paragraph of the covenant described under “Limitation on Indebtedness” above on a
euro-for-euro basis; and

(xxix) any dividends, repayments of equity, reductions of capital, loans or any other distribution (a “tax
_distribution”) by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Parent Entity that is a member of the_
same fiscal unity (steuerliche Organschaft) for German corporate income tax and trade tax purposes;
_provided that:_

(A) where payments under a German fiscal unity are required to be made by any Parent Entity to cover
Taxes on a consolidated basis on behalf of the Group, a tax distribution shall be made in cash to such
Parent Entity in accordance with the definition of Permitted Tax Distribution; and

(B) the remainder of such tax distribution in excess of the amount permitted pursuant to clause (A) above
shall not be paid to such Parent Entity in cash but instead be converted into an intercompany loan
made by such Parent Entity to the Company which constitutes Subordinated Liabilities (as defined in
the Intercreditor Agreement), save to the extent otherwise agreed by the Agent.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a Restricted Payment (or portion
thereof) (i) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Payments described in the second
paragraph of this covenant, and/or (ii) is permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and/or
(iii) constitutes a Permitted Investment, the Company will be entitled to classify such Restricted Payment or
Investment (or portion thereof) on the date of its payment or later reclassify (based on circumstances existing on
the date of such reclassification) such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) in any manner that
complies with this covenant, including as a Permitted Investment.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the Applicable Test
Date of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value of any cash
Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted Payment,
property or assets other than cash shall be determined conclusively by the Company acting in good faith.

Unrestricted Subsidiaries may use value transferred from the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries in a
Permitted Investment or a Restricted Investment not prohibited under this covenant to purchase or otherwise
acquire Indebtedness or Capital Stock of the Company, any Parent Entity or any of the Company’s Restricted
Subsidiaries, and to transfer value to the holders of the Capital Stock or any Parent Entity and to Affiliates
thereof, and such purchase, acquisition, or transfer will not be deemed to be a “direct or indirect” action by the
Company or the Restricted Subsidiaries.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Company will not, and the Company will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly,
create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Company), whether owned on the Acquisition Closing Date or acquired after that date, or any
interest therein or any income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the
“Initial Lien”), except:

(i) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral:

(A) Permitted Liens; or

370


-----

(B) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if obligations under the Notes and the Indenture
are directly secured equally and ratably with or prior to, or, in the case of Liens with respect to Senior
Indebtedness, (at the Company’s option) junior to, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so
long as such Indebtedness is so secured; and

(ii) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any Lien created in favor of the Notes pursuant to sub-clause (i)(B) of the first paragraph of this covenant will be
automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to
which it relates and (ii) otherwise as set forth in the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and/or under the
relevant Topco Security Document.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of the
Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms,
accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of
property securing Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Disposition
unless:

(i) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including by way of
relief from, or by any other person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) at
least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be determined on the date of contractually
agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined in good faith by the Company, of the shares and assets
subject to such Asset Disposition (including, for the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a
Permitted Asset Swap);

(ii) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions, with a purchase price in excess of the
greater of (x) €265 million and (y) an amount equal to twenty (20) per cent. of LTM EBITDA, except in the
case of a Permitted Asset Swap, at least seventy-five (75) per cent. of the consideration for such Asset
Disposition, together with all other Asset Dispositions since the Acquisition Closing Date (on a cumulative
basis), received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of Cash
Equivalent Investments; and provided that the amount of:

(A) the greater of the principal amount and the carrying value of any liabilities (as reflected on the
Company’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent consolidated balance sheet or in the footnotes
thereto or, if Incurred or increased subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, such liabilities that
would have been reflected on the Company’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s consolidated balance
sheet or in the footnotes thereto if such incurrence or increase had taken place on or prior to the date of
such balance sheet, as determined by the Company) of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary,
other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes, that are (1) assumed by the
transferee of any such assets (or a third party in connection with such transfer) pursuant to a written
agreement which releases or indemnifies the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from such
liabilities or (2) otherwise cancelled or terminated in connection with the transaction;

(B) any securities, notes or other obligations or assets received by the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted or reasonably expected by the Company acting in
good faith to be converted by Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into Cash Equivalent
Investments (to the extent of the Cash Equivalent Investments received or expected to be received) or
by their terms are required to be satisfied for Cash Equivalent Investments within one hundred and
eighty (180) days following the closing of such Asset Disposition; and

(C) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary in
such Asset Disposition having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated
Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (C) that is at that time outstanding, not to
exceed the greater of (x) €331 million and (y) an amount equal to twenty-five (25) per cent. of LTM
EBITDA at the time of the receipt of such Designated Non-Cash Consideration (or, at the Company’s

371


-----

option, at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition), with the fair market value of
each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without
giving effect to subsequent changes in value,

shall each be deemed to be Cash Equivalent Investments for purposes of this provision and for no other
purpose;

(iii) an amount equal to one hundred (100) per cent. of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is
applied, to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (at its sole
discretion):

(A) to prepay, repay or purchase:

(1) any Senior Indebtedness; and/or

(2) any other Permitted Debt (provided that such application would comply with the covenant
described under “Limitation on Restricted Payments”),

(in each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary);

(B) to invest in or commit to invest in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in
Additional Assets by a Restricted Subsidiary equal to the amount of Net Available Cash received by
the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary); and/or

(C) to make any Restricted Payment or Permitted Payment permitted to be made under the covenant
described under “Limitation on Restricted Payments” or any Permitted Investment,

in each case, within six hundred and thirty-five (635) days from the later of (1) the date of such Asset
Disposition and (2) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided that:

(1) in connection with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to sub-clause
(iii)(A) above, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will
cause the related commitment (if any) (other than in the case of any asset-based credit facility, any
revolving credit facility (including a Revolving Facility) or a Guarantee Facility) to be reduced in
an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased;

(2) a binding commitment or letter of intent entered into not later than such 635th day shall be treated
as a permitted application of the Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment or letter of
intent so long as the Company, or such Restricted Subsidiary, enters into such commitment or
letter of intent with the good faith expectation that such Net Available Cash will be applied to
satisfy such commitment or letter of intent within the later of such 635th day and one hundred and
eighty (180) days of such commitment or letter of intent (an “Acceptable Commitment”) or, in the
event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before the Net
Available Cash is applied in connection therewith, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary
enters into another Acceptable Commitment (a “Second Commitment”) within one hundred and
eighty (180) days of such cancellation or termination; provided further that if any Second
Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Net Available Cash is
applied, then such Net Available Cash shall constitute Excess Proceeds; and

(3) pending the final application of the amount of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with
sub-clauses (iii)(A) to (iii)(C) above, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries may
temporarily reduce Indebtedness or otherwise use such Net Available Cash in any manner
permitted by the Indenture.

The following amount of Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or
committed to be applied or invested as provided in the first paragraph of this covenant will be deemed to
constitute “Excess Proceeds” under the Indenture:

(i) if the Total Net Leverage Ratio as at the Applicable Test Date in respect of the relevant Asset Disposition
exceeds 6.00:1.00, one hundred (100) per cent of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition; or

(ii) if the Total Net Leverage Ratio as at the Applicable Test Date in respect of the relevant Asset Disposition
exceeds 5.75:1.00 but does not exceed 6.00:1.00, fifty (50) per cent. of the Net Available Cash from such
Asset Disposition; or

(iii) if the Total Net Leverage Ratio as at the Applicable Test Date in respect of the relevant Asset Disposition
does not exceed 5.75:1.00, zero (0) per cent of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition;

372


-----

in each case, provided that:

(A) to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary has elected to prepay, repay or purchase any amount
of Notes or other Pari Passu Indebtedness at a price of no less than one hundred (100) per cent. of the
principal amount thereof, to the extent the creditors in respect of such Pari Passu Indebtedness (including
the Holders) elect not to tender their Pari Passu Indebtedness for such prepayment, repayment or purchase,
the Company will be deemed to have applied an amount of Net Available Cash equal to such amount not
tendered under this clause (A), and such amount shall not increase the amount of Excess Proceeds (such
amount, together with the aggregate amount described under the fourth paragraph of this covenant, the
“Declined Proceeds”); and

(B) for the avoidance of doubt, Net Available Cash that will not constitute Excess Proceeds pursuant to clause
(ii) or (iii) of this paragraph above shall be immediately available to the Group for any purposes permitted
by the Indenture, including to make Restricted Payments in accordance with clause (xxvi) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “Limitation on Restricted Payments,” without regard to the
periods specified in clause (iii) of the first paragraph of this covenant.

On the 635th day (or such longer period permitted by the first paragraph of this covenant) after the later of an
Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds under
this covenant exceeds the greater of (x) €397 million and (y) an amount equal to thirty (30) per cent. of LTM
EBITDA in a single transaction, the Company will within ten (10) Business Days make an offer (an “Asset
_Disposition Offer”) to all Holders of the Notes and, if required or permitted by the terms of any Pari Passu_
Indebtedness, to the holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum aggregate principal
amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness that may be purchased
out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to (i) in the case of the Notes, 100% of the
principal amount thereof (or accreted value, if less), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for
the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture, and (ii) in the case of such
Pari Passu Indebtedness, the offer price required by the terms thereof, in accordance with the procedures set forth
in the agreement(s) governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness.

The Company may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Available Cash from an Asset
Disposition by making an Asset Disposition Offer with respect to such Net Available Cash prior to the expiration
of the relevant six hundred and thirty-five (635) days (or such longer period provided above) (the “Asset
_Disposition Offer Period”) with respect to all or part of the Net Available Cash (the “Advance Portion”) in_
advance of being required to do so by the Indenture (an “Advance Offer”).

If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes and other Pari Passu Indebtedness, as
the case may be, surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the amount offered in the Asset Disposition Offer
(or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Company shall prepay, repay or purchase the
Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, on a pro rata basis based on the aggregate principal
amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of the Notes or such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be,
tendered with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes or Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, will be
repurchased in part in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any such Asset Disposition Offer (or
Advance Offer), the amount of Excess Proceeds that resulted in the requirement to make an Asset Disposition
Offer shall be reset to zero (0) (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds upon such
completion). Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset Disposition Offer, any remaining Net Available
Cash shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Company may use such Net Available Cash for any purpose
permitted by the Indenture.

To the extent that the aggregate amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness,
as the case may be, tendered pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the amount offered in the Asset
Disposition Offer (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Company may use any
remaining Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) for any purposes not
otherwise prohibited under the Indenture.

An Asset Disposition Offer or Advance Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with
respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, the Notes and/or the Note Guarantees (but the
Asset Disposition Offer or Advance Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents).

Pending the final application of the amount of any Net Available Cash pursuant to this covenant, the Company
and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness, or otherwise use such Net Available Cash
in any manner permitted by the Indenture.

373


-----

The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities
laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the
repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer or an Advance Offer. To the extent that the
provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Company will
comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its
obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

The provisions under the Indenture related to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes
as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes.

For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such indebtedness not denominated in euro, such
Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amount into its Euro Equivalent amount
determined as of a date selected by the Company that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period.

The Senior Facilities Agreement and the Secured Notes Indenture may prohibit or limit, and future credit
agreements or other agreements to which the Company becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Company from
purchasing any Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Company is prohibited from purchasing the
Notes, the Company could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to
refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Company does not obtain such consent or repay
such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Company’s failure to
purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture.

**Limitation on Affiliate Transactions**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into or conduct any transaction or
series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of
any service) with any Affiliate of the Company (any such transaction or series of related transactions being an
“Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of (x) €132 million and (y) an amount
equal to ten (10) per cent. of LTM EBITDA unless:

(i) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Company or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable

amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in clauses (i) to (iv) of this
paragraph or this clause (xv); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to

material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the
Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other
modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Company).

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation
would not cause a Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate
fair market value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries in the
Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of
the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments pursuant to the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” or under one or more clauses of the definition of “Permitted
Payments” or “Permitted Investments,” as determined by the Company. That designation will only be permitted
if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition
of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The Company may redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted
Subsidiary if that redesignation would not cause a Default.

Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Company as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the Trustee
on the date of such designation by delivering to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such
designation complies with the preceding conditions and was permitted by the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Restricted Payments.” If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the
preceding requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for
purposes of the Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted
Subsidiary as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Company will be in default
of such covenant.

The Company may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that
such designation will be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any
outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (1) such
Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” (including
pursuant to clause (v) of the second paragraph thereof treating such redesignation as an acquisition for the
purpose of such clause), calculated on a pro forma basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of
the Applicable Test Date; and (2) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence following such
designation. Any such designation by the Company shall be evidenced to the Trustee by filing with the Trustee
an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complies with the preceding conditions.

**_Reports_**

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Company will furnish to the Trustee the following reports following
the Issue Date:

(1) within 120 days (or, in the case of the fiscal year ending September 30, 2020, 150 days) after the end of

unreasonable expense, in which case the Company will provide, in the case of a material acquisition,
acquired company financials; (iii) an operating and financial review of the unaudited financial statements,
including a discussion of the consolidated financial condition, results of operations, EBITDA and material
changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Company and (iv) material recent developments; and

parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for so long
as the Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons who are not “affiliates” under the
Securities Act.

All financial statement information (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the calculations made under any
incurrence covenant, which shall be prepared in accordance with the terms of this Indenture) shall be prepared in
accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of
IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for the periods presented, except as may otherwise be described
in such information; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (3) and (4) above may, in the
event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods. No report need include
separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the Company or any disclosure with respect to the results of
operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure. In addition, the reports set forth above will not be
required to contain any reconciliation to U.S. GAAP.

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to be material if the entity or
business acquired or disposed of represents greater than 20% of the Company’s pro forma consolidated revenue
or LTM EBITDA for the most recent four quarters for which annual or quarterly financial reports have been
delivered to the Trustee.

At any time that any of the Company’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the

380


-----

Company, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of this “Reports”
covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the
footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and the Restricted
Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the
Company.

In the event that (i) the Company becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports required by
Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Company elects to provide to the Trustee reports which, if filed with the
SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Company) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or
15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision of U.S. GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or
information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it elects, the Company will make available to
the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Company is, or would be,
required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d).

securities of the Company, the Target or any Parent Entity or IPO Entity are listed on the Main Market of the
London Stock Exchange (or one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange,

the Target or such Parent Entity or IPO Entity is subject to the admission and disclosure standards applicable to
issuers of equity securities admitted to trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange (or the
equivalent standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to trading on one or more of the
equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange), for so long as it elects, the Company will make available to the

_provided that such requirements require the Company, the Target or any Parent Entity or IPO Entity to prepare_

be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in this “Reports” covenant.

The Company may comply with any requirement to provide reports or financial statements under this “Reports”
covenant by providing (x) any report or financial statements of a direct or indirect Parent Entity of the Company

content and time of delivery) of this “Reports” covenant as if references to the Company therein were references
to such Parent Entity and (b) include condensed consolidated financial information together with separate

Transactions. For purposes of this covenant and any determination or calculation to be made under the Indenture,
the Company may use financial statements of a predecessor of the Company or the Target for reporting or
making calculations with respect to periods commencing prior to the Acquisition Closing Date.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or negligently omit
to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security Interest with respect to the
Collateral (it being understood that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens, or the confirmation or
affirmation of security interests in respect of the Collateral, shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially
impair the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the
Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security
Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Topco Security
Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest in any of the
Collateral that is prohibited by the covenants described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “—Limitation
on Liens”; provided, that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur any Lien over any of the
Collateral that is not prohibited by the covenants described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” and
“—Limitation on Liens”, including Permitted Collateral Liens, and the Collateral may be discharged, transferred
or released in any circumstances not prohibited by the Indenture or the Topco Security Documents.

Notwithstanding the first paragraph of this covenant, nothing in this covenant shall restrict the discharge, transfer
or release of any Collateral or Lien in any circumstance in accordance with the Indenture and the Topco Security
Documents. Subject to the foregoing, the Topco Security Documents may be amended, extended, renewed,
restated, supplemented, replaced or otherwise modified or released (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien
of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets) (1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency
therein; (2) for the purposes of Incurring Permitted Collateral Liens; (3) to add to the Collateral; (4) to make any
other change thereto that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect; or (5) to amend, extend,
renew, restate, supplement, replace or otherwise modify or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien
of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets) any Topco Security Documents for the purposes of
undertaking a Permitted Reorganization and/or Permitted Tax Restructuring or a transaction not prohibited by the
covenants described under “Merger and Consolidation”; provided, however, that in the case of clauses (4) and (5)
above, no Topco Security Document may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, replaced or
otherwise modified or released (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over
the same assets), unless contemporaneously with such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement supplement,
replacement or modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent
ranking over the same assets), the Company delivers to the Security Agent and the Trustee, either (i) a solvency
opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Security Agent and the Trustee, from an
Independent Financial Advisor or appraiser or investment bank of international standing which confirms the
solvency of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to
such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, replacement, modification or release (followed by
an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), (ii) a certificate from the
chief financial officer or the Board of Directors of the relevant Person which confirms the solvency of the person
granting any such Lien after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, replacement, modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at
least equivalent ranking over the same assets), or (iii) an Opinion of Counsel (subject to any qualifications
customary for this type of Opinion of Counsel), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee,
confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, replacement, modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at
least equivalent ranking over the same assets), the Lien or Liens created under the Topco Security Document, so
amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, replaced, modified or released (followed by an immediate
retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets) are valid and perfected Liens not otherwise
subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were
not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement,
replacement, modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking
over the same assets) and to which the new Indebtedness secured by the Permitted Collateral Lien is not subject.

In the event that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries comply with the requirements of this covenant, the
Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such
actions without the need for instructions from the Holders.

**_Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries_**

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Company shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary, other than a
Guarantor or a Securitization Subsidiary, to guarantee the payment of (i) any syndicated Credit Facility or
(ii) Public Debt of the Company or any Guarantor in an aggregate principal amount in excess of the greater of (x)
€331 million and (y) 25% of LTM EBITDA at such time, unless such Restricted Subsidiary within 60 days after
the guarantee of such Indebtedness executes and delivers a supplemental indenture to the Indenture providing for
a Note Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary, which Note Guarantee shall rank senior to or pari passu with
such Restricted Subsidiary’s guarantee of such other Indebtedness, except that with respect to a guarantee of
Senior Indebtedness of the Company or any Guarantor, such Note Guarantee may be expressly subordinated and
rank junior in right of payment to such Restricted Subsidiary’s guarantee of such other Indebtedness to the same
extent as the Note Guarantees are subordinated to the Senior Indebtedness being guaranteed; provided that this
covenant shall not be applicable to any guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary that existed at the time such
Person became a Restricted Subsidiary and was not incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such
Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary. The Company may elect, in its sole discretion, to cause any Subsidiary
that is not otherwise required to be a Guarantor to become a Guarantor, in which case such Subsidiary shall not
be required to comply with the 60-day period described in this paragraph.

At the option of the Company, any Note Guarantee may contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the extent
reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate
to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital
maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other
considerations under applicable law.

Future Note Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under “Note
Guarantees—Note Guarantee Releases.” A Note Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the
option of the Company if at the date of such release there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding
which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with this
Indenture as at the date of such release if such Guarantor were not designated as a Guarantor as at that date. The
Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers
under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, reasonably requested by, and at the
cost of, the Company to effectuate any release of a Note Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject
to customary protections and indemnifications.

The validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of each
Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the
Notes—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Guarantees
and the Notes Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Notes
Collateral” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of
the Note Guarantees and Security Interests.”

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Company, in connection with the Incurrence by the
Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of: (i) any Indebtedness secured on Collateral or as otherwise
required herein; and (ii) any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness referred to in sub-clause
(i) above, the Company, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into
with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an
“Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) or a restatement, amendment or other modification of the existing
Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially
less favorable to the Holders (taken as a whole)), including substantially the same terms with respect to release of
Note Guarantees and priority and release of the Security Interests, provided that: (A) such Additional
Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent or, in the
reasonable opinion of the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties,
liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent under the Indenture, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement; (B) if more than one such intercreditor agreement is outstanding at
any time, the correlative terms of such intercreditor agreements must not conflict; and (C) regardless of the
number of Intercreditor Agreements or Additional Intercreditor agreements, only one payment blockage notice
may be served in any period of 360 consecutive days or in respect of the same event or circumstance and any
such payment blockages may not be in effect for more than 179 days in the aggregate during any consecutive
360-day period.

383


-----

The Indenture will also provide that, at the direction of the Company and without the consent of Holders, the
Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, manifest error
or inconsistency of any such agreement; (ii) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such
agreement that may be Incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such
agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the
addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior to the Topco Notes); (iii) add Restricted
Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement; (iv) further secure the
Notes (including Additional Notes); (v) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure
Additional Notes; (vi) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens; (vii) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof; or (viii) make any other change to any
such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders (taken as a whole) in any material respect, making all
necessary provisions to ensure that the Notes and the Note Guarantees are secured by first-priority Liens over the
Collateral. In formulating its decisions on such matters, the Trustee and the Security Agent, if applicable, shall be
entitled to require and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including Officer’s Certificates
and Opinions of Counsel.

The Indenture will also provide that the Company shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to
enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, other than:
(i) in accordance with the second paragraph of this covenant; or (ii) with the consent of the requisite majority of
Holders except as otherwise permitted below under “—Amendments and Waivers”, and the Company may only
direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not
impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent or, in the reasonable opinion of the Trustee
or the Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under this
Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the requisite majority of
Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of
any obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby, provided that such transaction would comply with the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and
accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
(whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein), and to have
directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Financial Calculations_**

When calculating the satisfaction of or availability under any Applicable Metric in the Indenture in connection
with any Applicable Transaction, the date of determination of such Applicable Metric shall, at the option of the
Company, be any Applicable Test Date. If the Company elects to determine any Applicable Metric as of any
Applicable Test Date, it shall give pro forma effect to any other Applicable Transactions that have occurred up to
(and including) such Applicable Test Date; provided that the pro forma calculation may exclude any
non-recurring fees, costs and expenses attributable to any Applicable Transaction.

If compliance with an Applicable Metric is established in accordance with the preceding paragraph, such
Applicable Metric shall be deemed to have been complied with (or satisfied) for all purposes; provided that
(a) the Company may elect, in its sole discretion, to recalculate any Applicable Metric on the basis of a more
recent Applicable Test Date, in which case, such date of redetermination shall thereafter be deemed to be the
relevant Applicable Test Date for purposes of such Applicable Metrics; and (b) save as contemplated in clause
(a) above, compliance with any Applicable Metric shall not be determined or tested at any time after the relevant
Applicable Test Date for such transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto.

If any Applicable Metric for which compliance was determined or tested as of an Applicable Test Date would at
any time after the Applicable Test Date have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been complied with as a
result of fluctuations in such Applicable Metric (or any other Applicable Metric), such Applicable Metric will not
be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to have been complied with as a result of such fluctuations.

If any related requirements and conditions (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of
Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was determined or tested as of the Applicable Test Date would at
any time after the Applicable Test Date not have been complied with or satisfied (including due to the occurrence

384


-----

or continuation of a Default or an Event of Default), such requirements and conditions will not be deemed to
have been failed to be complied with or satisfied (and such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed not to
have occurred or be continuing).

If an item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) is committed, incurred or issued, any Lien is committed or
incurred or any other transaction is undertaken or any Applicable Metric is tested in reliance on a ratio-based
basket based on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Secured Net
Leverage Ratio or the Total Net Leverage Ratio or any other ratio based Applicable Metric, such ratios shall be
calculated without regard to the Incurrence of any Indebtedness to finance the working capital needs of the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries under any revolving facility, letter of credit facility or bank guarantee
facility and/or other debt which is available to be re-drawn (including under any Revolving Facility, any
Guarantee Facility or any ancillary facility under the Senior Facilities Agreement) and, for the avoidance of
doubt, any undrawn commitments for Indebtedness (including under a Revolving Facility or Guarantee Facility)
shall be disregarded for the purposes of testing the Applicable Metric.

If any Applicable Metric is determined by reference to the greater of a fixed amount (the “numerical
_permission”) and a percentage of LTM EBITDA (the “grower permission”) and the grower permission of the_
Applicable Metric exceeds the applicable numerical permission at any time as a result of an acquisition or
Investment that is permitted under the Indenture, the numerical permission shall be deemed to be increased to the
highest amount of the grower permission reached from time to time as a result of any such acquisitions and/or
investments and shall not subsequently be reduced as a result of any decrease in the grower permission.

Subject to the limitations imposed under clause (ii) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under
“Limitation on Indebtedness,” if a proposed action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) is
incurred or entered into pursuant to a fixed permission and at a later time would subsequently be permitted under
a ratio-based permission, unless otherwise elected by the Company, such action, matter, transaction or amount
(or a portion thereof) shall automatically be reclassified to such ratio-based permission. For any relevant
Applicable Metric set by reference to a fiscal year, a calendar year, a Relevant Period, a four-quarter period, a
twelve-month period or any other similar annual period (each an “Annual Period”):

(i) at the option of the Company, the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during such
Annual Period may be increased by: (A) an amount equal to 100% of the difference (if positive) between the
permitted amount in the immediately preceding Annual Period and the amount thereof actually used or
applied by the Group during such preceding Annual Period (the “Carry Forward Amount”); and/or (B) an
amount equal to 100% of the permitted amount in the immediately following Annual Period and the
permitted amount in such immediately following Annual Period shall be reduced by such corresponding
amount (the “Carry Back Amount”); and

(ii) to the extent that the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during such Annual
Period is increased in accordance with clause (i) above, any usage of such Applicable Metric during such
Annual Period shall be deemed to be applied in the following order: (A) first, against the Carry Forward
Amount; (B) second, against the maximum amount so permitted during such Annual Period prior to any
increase in accordance with clause (i) above; and (C) third, against the Carry Back Amount.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Company_

The Company will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise
dispose of all or substantially all its assets, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any person,
unless:

(i) the resulting, surviving or transferee person (the “Successor Company”) will be a person organised and
existing under the laws of England, Luxembourg, United States, Germany, a Member State of the European
Union (or any other jurisdiction approved by all of the Holders) and the Successor Company (if not the
Company) will expressly assume, by way of supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee,
all the obligations of the Company under the Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Topco Security Documents, as applicable;

385


-----

(ii) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the applicable Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the applicable Successor Company as
a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the applicable Successor Company or such
Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and:

(A) the Company or the Successor Company would be able to Incur at least an additional €1.00 of
Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under “Limitation on
Indebtedness;” or

(B) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not be lower, or the Total Net Leverage Ratio would not be
higher, than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction;

(iii) the Company or the Successor Company, as the case may be, shall have delivered to the Trustee an
Officer’s Certificate to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental
indenture comply with the Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental
indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Topco Security Documents, as applicable, are legal and
binding agreements enforceable against the Successor Company; provided that in giving an Opinion of
Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact; and

(iv) the Holders (or the Security Agent on their behalf) will continue to have the same or substantially equivalent
(ignoring for the purposes of assessing such equivalency any limitations required in accordance with the
Agreed Security Principles or hardening periods (or any similar or equivalent concept)) guarantees and
security over the same or substantially equivalent assets and over the shares (or other interests) in the
Company or the Successor Company, save to the extent such assets or shares (or other interests) cease to
exist (provided that if the shares (or other interests) in the Company cease to exist, security will be granted
(subject to the Agreed Security Principles) over the shares (or other interests) in the Successor Company).

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the
Company under the Notes and the Indenture.

_Guarantors_

No Guarantor may:

(i) consolidate with or merge with or into any person;

(ii) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or dispose of, all or substantially all its assets, in one transaction or a
series of related transactions, to any person; or

(iii) permit any person to merge with or into such Guarantor,

unless:

(A) the other person is the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor (or becomes a Guarantor
substantially concurrently with the transaction); or

(B) either (x) the Company or a Guarantor is the continuing person or (y) the resulting, surviving or transferee
person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor under the Indenture and all obligations of
the Company under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Topco
Security Documents, as applicable, and immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default is
continuing; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the
Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (in each case other
than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Indenture.

_General_

The provisions set forth in this covenant “Merger and Consolidation” shall not restrict (and shall not apply to):

(i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Company or a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging or
liquidating into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Company, a
Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Company or a Guarantor;

(ii) any Guarantor from merging or liquidating into or transferring all or part of its properties and assets to the
Company or a Guarantor;

386


-----

(iii) any consolidation or merger of the Company into any Guarantor; provided that, if the Company is not the
surviving entity of such merger or consolidation:

(A) the relevant Guarantor will assume the obligations of the Company under the Notes, the Indenture, the
Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Topco
Security Documents and clauses (i), (iii) and (iv) of the covenant described under “Merger and
Consolidation—Company” above shall apply to such transaction; and

(B) to the extent that any Collateral previously granted over the shares in the capital of the relevant
Guarantor would not, in accordance with applicable law, constitute a Lien over the shares in the capital
of the surviving entity, the direct Holding Company of the surviving entity shall, subject to the Agreed
Security Principles, grant Collateral in the form of Security Interests over the shares in the capital of
the surviving entity on substantially equivalent terms to any Security Interests granted over the shares
in the capital of such predecessor Guarantor immediately prior to such merger or consolidation;

(iv) the Company or any Guarantor consolidating into or merging or combining with an Affiliate incorporated or
organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of such entity, reincorporating such entity in
another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such entity; provided that, in the case of a consolidation,
merger or combination of:

(A) the Company into or with an Affiliate that is not a Guarantor, clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of the
covenant described under “Merger and Consolidation—Company” shall apply to such transaction; and

(B) any Guarantor into or with an Affiliate, sub-clause (iii) above shall apply to such transaction; or

(v) the Transactions or any Permitted Transaction.

_Other Merger and Consolidation Terms_

A Permitted Specified Asset Disposition shall not be deemed to be the sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer,
lease or disposal of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company or one or more
Subsidiaries of the Company, and such Permitted Specified Asset Disposition shall not be subject to the
covenants described under “—Merger and Consolidation—Company” and this “Merger and Consolidation—
Guarantors” covenant.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve
“all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, this covenant will not prohibit or restrict to the
Transactions or the creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary.

**Events of Default**

Subject to the two succeeding paragraphs, each of the following is an Event of Default under the Indenture:

(a) default in any payment of interest on any Note when due and payable, continued for thirty (30) days;

(b) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note when due at its Stated
Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;

(c) failure by the Company or any Guarantor to comply for sixty (60) days after written notice by the Trustee on
behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Notes with any agreement or obligation contained in the Indenture;

(d) the occurrence of any default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued
or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or
any Significant Subsidiary or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Company or any Significant
Subsidiary in each case other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, whether
such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the date hereof, which default:

(i) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness, at its stated final maturity (after giving
effect to any applicable grace periods) provided in such Indebtedness (a “payment default”); or

(ii) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity (the “cross-acceleration
_provision”),_

387


-----

and, in each case, the aggregate principal amount of all Indebtedness subject to such payment defaults or
accelerations (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), is in excess of the greater of (x)
€331 million and (y) an amount equal to twenty-five (25) per cent. of LTM EBITDA;

(e) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of Parentco, the Company or a Significant
Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”) which, in each case, are sanctioned by a court and become
unconditional;

(f) failure by the Company or a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of the
greater of (x) €331 million and (y) an amount equal to twenty-five (25) per cent. of LTM EBITDA, other
than any judgments covered by indemnities provided by, or insurance policies issued by, reputable and
creditworthy companies, which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of
more than sixty (60) days (after receipt of notice from the Agent) after such judgment becomes final, and in
the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any
creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed (the “judgment default provision”);

(g) any Security Interest under the Topco Security Documents having a fair market value in excess of
€132 million shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms
of the relevant Topco Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the Indenture) for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the
Indenture or the release of any such Security Interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Topco Security Documents or any
such Security Interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in writing that any such Security Interest is invalid or unenforceable and
any such Default continues for 10 days (the “security default provisions”);

(h) except as permitted under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (including with respect to any limitations), any Note Guarantee of any one or more Guarantors
that is a Significant Subsidiary is held in any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid or ceases for
any reason to be in full force and effect, or any one or more Guarantors that is a Significant Subsidiary
denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Note Guarantee (the “guarantee default provisions”); and

(i) the failure by the Company to consummate the Special Mandatory Redemption to the extent required, as
described under “Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

However, a Default under clauses (d) or (f) of the first paragraph above will not constitute an Event of Default
unless (i) the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have
notified the Company of the Default and (ii) the Company has not cured such Default within sixty (60) days after
receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (e) of the first paragraph of this section
“Events of Default”) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by written notice to the Company, or the Holders of at
least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may,
and the Trustee (subject to certain conditions) at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of and
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such
principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a
declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (d) has occurred and is
continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or
payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to such clause (d) shall be remedied or cured, or
waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have
been discharged in full, in each case, within thirty (30) days after the declaration of acceleration with respect
thereto and the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a
court of competent jurisdiction.

If an Event of Default described in clause (e) of the first paragraph of this section “Events of Default” occurs and
is continuing, the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes will become and be
immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the
Topco Security Documents except as provided in such Topco Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive
all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to non-payment of principal, premium,

388


-----

interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note held by a non-consenting Holder, which may only be waived
with the consent of Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes) and
rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences (including the payment default that
resulted from such acceleration) if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of
competent jurisdiction.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in
connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such
Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default that
resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or
Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant titled “—Certain
Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the
Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such
notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the
Indenture.

The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request
or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security
satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right
to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the
Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the Trustee
to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security and/or indemnity
satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and the
offer of security and/or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a
written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day
period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given
the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, of which a
responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its
powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee,
however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee
determines (after consultation with counsel) is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would
involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be
entitled to indemnification and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against all fees, losses,
liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.

The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed in writing of
such occurrence by the Company, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after
being notified by the Company. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if
any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith
determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders.

The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s
Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year.
The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of
any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the
Company is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Except as provided in the next two succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture and the other Note Documents may be
amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal

389


-----

amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender
offer or exchange offer for, such Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any existing Default or Event of
Default (other than a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal or premium, Additional Amounts, if
any, or interest on any Note (including in connection with an offer to purchase), except a payment default
resulting from an acceleration that has been rescinded) or compliance with any provision of the Indenture and the
other Note Documents may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or
tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes). If any amendment, supplement or waiver will only affect one or
more series of Notes (but not all series of Notes), only the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the then outstanding Notes of the series so affected (and not the consent of the Holders of at least a
majority in aggregate principal amount of all Notes then outstanding), shall be required.

However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% (or, in the case of clause (7) of this
paragraph, 80%) of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes (provided, however, that if any
amendment, supplement, waiver or other modification or consent will only affect one or more series of Notes
(but not all series of Notes), only the consent of the holders of at least 90% (or, in the case of clause (7) below,
80%) of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of the series so affected will be required),
an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Note (other than
provisions relating to a Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(2) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Note (other than provisions relating to a
Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(3) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Note or change the time at which any such
Note may be redeemed, in each case as described under “Optional Redemption” and “Redemption for
Taxation Reasons”;

(4) make any such Note payable in currency other than that stated in such Note;

(5) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal of, or interest
or Additional Amounts, if any, on such Holder’s Notes on or after the due dates therefor;

(6) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture described under “Withholding Taxes” that adversely
affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the terms of such Notes in a
way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an exemption
from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder unless the applicable Payor agrees
to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(7) release all or substantially all Security Interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral (taken
as a whole) other than in accordance with the terms of the Topco Security Documents, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture; provided that, for the
avoidance of doubt and without prejudice to the provisions governing a Change of Control, the release of
less than all or substantially all Security Interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral
(taken as a whole) shall only require the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the
Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or
exchange offer for, Notes) and any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with
the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes);

(8) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest or
Additional Amounts, if any (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at
least a majority in principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from
such acceleration);

(9) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Note Guarantee or this Indenture, except in
accordance with the terms of this Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(10) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose holders must consent to any amendment, waiver or
modification or make any other change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’
consent described in this sentence.

390


-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Company, the Trustee and the other
parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Note Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect, error or inconsistency or reduce the minimum denomination
of the Notes;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person or a co-issuer of the obligations of the Company or a
Guarantor under any Note Document, including, without limitation, in connection with a Permitted
Reorganization);

(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Note Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any right or
power conferred upon the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or make
any change (including changing the ISIN, common code, CUSIP or other identifying number on any Notes)
that does not adversely affect the rights of the Trustee or any Holder in any material respect;

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a member of
senior management of the Company) for the issuance of Additional Notes that may be issued in compliance
with this Indenture;

(6) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the covenants described
under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness
by Restricted Subsidiaries,” to add Note Guarantees with respect to the Notes, to add security to or for the
benefit of the Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any
Guarantee or Lien with respect to or securing the Notes when such release, termination, discharge or
retaking is provided for under the Indenture, the Topco Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under any Debt Document of a successor Trustee
pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee to any Note Document;

(8) in the case of the Topco Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a Security Interest
in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Indenture or the Private Notes
Indenture, in any property which is required by the Topco Security Documents to be mortgaged, pledged or
hypothecated, or in which a Security Interest is required to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent
necessary to grant a Security Interest in the Collateral for the benefit of any Person; provided that the
granting of such Security Interest is not prohibited by the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment
of Security Interest” is complied with;

(9) conform the text of the Indenture, the Topco Security Documents or the Notes to any provision of this
“Description of the Senior Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of the Senior Notes”
was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Topco Security Documents or
the Notes;

(10) make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of Notes as
permitted by the Indenture, including to facilitate the issuance and administration of Notes; provided,
_however, that (i) compliance with the this Indenture as so amended would not result in Notes being_
transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any other applicable securities law and (ii) such amendment
does not adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer Notes in any material respect;

(11) comply with the rules of any applicable securities depositary;

(12) facilitate any transaction that complies with the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” and “—Merger and Consolidation”, relating to
mergers, consolidations and sales of assets; and

(13) comply with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements”.

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of, or actions taken in compliance with, the covenants
described under “—Certain Covenants” or this section “Amendments and Waivers” shall be deemed to impair or
affect any rights of Holders to receive payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on the Notes.

In formulating its decisions on such matters, the Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to
require and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including Officer’s Certificates and
Opinions of Counsel.

391


-----

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed
amendment, supplement or waiver of any Note Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance
thereof. A consent to any amendment, supplement or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder given in
connection with a sale or tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such sale or tender.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the paragraphs above, in order to effect an amendment authorized by
clauses (3) and (6) of the third paragraph of this section “Amendments and Waivers” to add a Guarantor under
the Indenture, it shall only be necessary for the supplemental indenture providing for the accession of such
additional Guarantor to be duly authorized and executed by (i) the Company, (ii) such additional Guarantor and
(iii) the Trustee. Any other amendments permitted by the Indenture need only be duly authorized and executed
by the Company, the Trustee and the Security Agent (to the extent applicable).

The Indenture will not contain a covenant regulating the offer and/or payment of a consent fee to Holders.

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of Notes have concurred in any direction,
waiver or consent, Notes owned by the Company, or by any Person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled
by or under direct or indirect common control with the Company, will be considered as though not outstanding,
except that for the purposes of determining whether the Trustee will be protected in relying on any such
direction, waiver or consent, only Notes that a responsible officer of the Trustee actually knows are so owned
will be so disregarded. For the avoidance of doubt, any Independent Debt Fund shall not be considered to be a
Person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the
Company.

**Defeasance**

The Company at any time may terminate all obligations of Parentco, the Company and the Guarantors under the
Note Documents (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for
certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities
and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Company in connection therewith and obligations
concerning issuing temporary Notes, registrations of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the
maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the
foregoing, if the Company exercises its legal defeasance option, the Topco Security Documents and the rights of
the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in
effect at such time will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Company at any time may terminate the obligations of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries under
the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (i), (iii) and (iv) of “—Certain
Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”—The Company) and “—Change of Control” and the default provisions
relating to such covenants described under “—Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross-default upon a
payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions (other than with respect to the
Company), the judgment default provision, the guarantee provision, and the security default provision described
under “—Events of Default” above (“covenant defeasance”).

The Company at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise
of its covenant defeasance option. If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes
may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. If the Company exercises its
covenant defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an
Event of Default specified in clause (c), (d), (e) (with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries), (f) or (g) under
“—Events of Default” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Company (i) must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance
_trust”) with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for this purpose) (a)_
for the benefit of the Holders of the Euro Fixed Rate Notes, cash in euro or European Government Obligations or
a combination thereof; and (b) for the benefit of the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes, cash in U.S. dollars or U.S.
Government Securities or a combination thereof, for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on
the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be; provided, that upon any redemption that requires the
payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the
extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of
the notice of redemption, with any deficit as of the date of redemption (any such amount, the “Applicable
_Premium Deficit”) only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption. Any_
Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee simultaneously
with the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit shall be

392


-----

applied toward such redemption, and (ii) must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the
Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, to the effect that Holders and
beneficial owners will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of
such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts and in the
same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not
occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel must be based on a ruling of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Service or change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law since the issuance of the
Notes);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Company with the intent of defeating,
hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Company; and

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to customary
assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to legal
defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Topco Security Documents, will be discharged and cease to be of further effect
(except as to surviving rights of transfer or exchange of the Notes and rights of the Trustee, as expressly provided
for in the Indenture) as to all Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other
than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes and certain Notes for which provision for payment was previously
made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Company) have been delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation; or (b) all Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and
payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for
redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption
by the Trustee or the Paying Agent in the name, and at the expense, of the Company; (2) the Company has
deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the
Trustee for this purpose), (i) for the benefit of the Holders of the Euro Fixed Rate Notes, money in euro or
European Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, and (ii) for the benefit of the Holders of the Dollar
Fixed Rate Notes, money in U.S. dollars or U.S. Government Securities or a combination thereof, as applicable,
in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Notes not previously delivered to the
Trustee for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date
of deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date,
as the case may be; provided that upon any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the
amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with
the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any
Applicable Premium Deficit only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption,
and any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee
simultaneously with the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable Premium
Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption; (3) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums
payable under the Indenture; (4) the Company has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the
Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption date,
as the case may be; and (5) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel each stating that all conditions precedent under the “—Satisfaction and Discharge” section of the
Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with; provided that any
such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the
foregoing clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4)).

If requested in writing by the Company to the Trustee and the Principal Paying Agent, the Trustee will distribute
any amounts deposited to the Holders prior to Stated Maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be;
_provided, however, that the Holders shall have received at least five Business Days’ notice from the Company of_
such earlier repayment date (which may be included in the notice of redemption). For the avoidance of doubt, the
distribution and payment to Holders prior to the maturity or redemption date as set forth above will not include
any negative interest, present value adjustment, break costs or any other premium on such amounts.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Note Documents or for

393


-----

any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a
Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of
the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the
view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee**

Deutsche Trustee Company Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will provide
that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has
written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in such Indenture. During the
existence of an Event of Default, of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the
Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of
care that a prudent person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or
refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.
Furthermore, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at
the request of any Holder, unless such Holder has offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to
the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the
Company, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of
any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee or any Agent will be permitted to engage in other
transactions with the Company and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced. Such terms
will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Company
and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated or
(b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Company may remove the
Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than 6 months may petition any court for
removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the
successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, taxes and
expenses incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or in connection with
the acceptance or administration of the Indenture. In formulating its decisions, the Trustee and the Security
Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate,
including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

**Notices**

If and for so long as Notes are listed on the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules of the Exchange so
require, notices of the Company with respect to the Notes will be sent to the Exchange.

All notices to Holders of Notes will be validly given if electronically delivered or mailed to them at their
respective addresses in the register of the Holders, if any, maintained by the registrar. For so long as any Notes
are represented by global notes, all notices to Holders will be delivered to DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream in
accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, delivery of which shall be
deemed to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph, which will give such notices to the Holders of book-entry
interests.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more than
once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed, such
notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after being so
mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or
other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed.
Failure to electronically deliver or mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect
its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is electronically delivered or mailed in
the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it. If a notice or
communication is given through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, it is duly given on the day the notice is given to
DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream.

394


-----

**Prescription**

Claims against the Company or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, premium, if any, or Additional
Amounts, if any, on the Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof.
Claims against the Company or any Guarantor for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed six
years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions**

Euro, with respect to the Euro Fixed Rate Notes, and U.S. dollars, with respect to the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes,
are the required currencies (each, a “Required Currency”) of account and payment for all sums payable by the
Company and the Guarantors, if any, under or in connection with the Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof, if
any, including damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than the applicable Required
Currency, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the
winding-up or dissolution of the Company, any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder, any Paying Agent or by
the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Company or a Guarantor will only constitute
a discharge to the Company or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the amount of the applicable
Required Currency which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other
currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on
the first date on which it is practicable to do so). If the amount of the applicable Required Currency is less than
the amount of the Required Currency expressed to be due to the recipient, any Paying Agent or the Trustee under
any Note, the Company and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or
the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Company and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient, any Paying
Agent or the Trustee on a joint and several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes
of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of
a Note, or any Paying Agent or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Company
(indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities
constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Company’s and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will
give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any
Holder of a Note, any Paying Agent or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will
continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in
respect of any sum due under any Note or any Note Guarantee, or to the Trustee. Except as otherwise specifically
set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction herein, the Euro
Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a non-euro currency shall be calculated based on
the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such non-euro amount is Incurred or made, as the case
may be.

**Listing**

Application will be made to list the Notes on the Exchange and for permission to be granted to deal in the Notes
on the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the application to list the Notes on the Exchange will be
approved or that permission to deal in the Notes thereon will be granted, and settlement of the Notes is not
conditioned on obtaining this listing or permission.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since a material portion of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries are located outside the United States,
any judgment obtained in the United States against the Company or the Guarantors, including judgments with
respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and
any purchase price with respect to the Notes, may not be collectable within the United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the Notes, the
Company and the Guarantors will in the Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state
courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City, County and State of New York, in the United States of America.
The Indenture will provide that the Company and each Guarantor will appoint an agent for service of process in
any suit, action or proceeding with respect to the Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees brought in any
U.S. federal or New York state court located in the City of New York.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Notes, including any Note Guarantees, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. For the avoidance of

395


-----

doubt, the governing law of the Indenture and the Notes may be amended with the consent of Holders of at least
a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a
purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes). The Intercreditor Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of England and Wales. The Topco Security Documents (including the Escrow Charges) will be
governed by the law of the location of the relevant asset that is part of the Collateral.

**Certain Definitions**

“Acceptable Nation” means Australia, Canada, any member state of the EU, Japan, Switzerland, the UK, the US,
or any other state, country or sub-division of a country which has a rating for its short-term unsecured and non
credit-enhanced debt obligations of A-1 or higher by S&P or F1 or higher by Fitch or P-1 or higher by Moody’s
or by an instrumentality or agency of any such government having an equivalent credit rating.

“Acquisition” has the meaning ascribed to such term in this offering memorandum.

“Acquired Indebtedness” means Indebtedness:

(a) of a person or any of its Subsidiaries existing at the time such person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary;

(b) assumed in connection with the acquisition of assets from such person, in each case whether or not Incurred
by such person in connection with such person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary or such acquisition; or

(c) of a person at the time such person merges with or into or consolidates or otherwise combines with the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary,

to such Indebtedness). Interest on a Capitalized Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate

of this definition. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a
factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be determined to have
been based upon the rate actually chosen, or if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Company
may designate.

**BOOK ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

Each series of Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A will
initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
“Rule 144A Global Notes”). On the Issue Date, the Rule 144A Global Notes representing the USD Notes (the
“USD Rule 144A Global Notes”) will be deposited upon issuance with the custodian for DTC and registered in
the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC. On the Issue Date, the Rule 144A Global Note representing the
EUR Notes (the “EUR Rule 144A Global Notes”) will be deposited upon issuance with a common depositary
and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream.

Each series of Notes sold outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on
Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more temporary global notes in
registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Temporary Regulation S Global Notes”). On the Issue
Date, the Temporary Regulation S Global Notes representing the USD Notes (the “Temporary USD Regulation S
Global Notes”) will be deposited upon issuance with the custodian for DTC and registered in the name of Cede &
Co., as nominee of DTC. On the Issue Date, the Temporary Regulation S Global Notes representing the EUR
Notes (the “Temporary EUR Regulation S Global Note”) will be deposited upon issuance with a common
depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream. Within a reasonable time period after the expiration of the distribution compliance period (as
defined under “—Transfers”), beneficial interests in the Temporary Regulation S Global Notes will be exchanged
for beneficial interests in one or more permanent global notes in registered form without interest coupons
attached and with denominations equal to the aggregate principal amount of the corresponding Temporary
Regulation S Global Notes (the “Permanent Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the Temporary
Regulation S Global Notes, the “Regulation S Global Notes”), upon receipt by the Trustee of the certifications
specified in the relevant Indenture. Simultaneously with the authentication of the Permanent Regulation S Global
Notes, the Trustee will cancel the Temporary Regulation S Global Notes. The Regulation S Global Notes and the
Rule 144A Global Notes are collectively referred to herein as the “Global Notes.”

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) and ownership of
interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the 144A
Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with DTC, in the
case of the Global Notes representing the USD Notes (the “USD Global Notes”), and Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, in the case of the Global Notes representing the EUR Notes (the “EUR Global Notes”), or persons
that may hold interests through such participants. Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof
will be effected only through, records maintained in book-entry form by DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream
and their participants. The Book-Entry Interests in Global Notes will only be issued in minimum denominations
of $200,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof (in the case of the USD Global Notes) and
minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof (in the case of the
EUR Global Notes).

The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, will credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant’s account
with the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states
of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in
definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests.
In addition, while the Notes are in global form, owners of interests in the Global Notes will not have the Notes
registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form (subject to very
limited exceptions) and will not be considered the registered owners or “Holder” of the Notes under the
Indentures for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the custodian for DTC or common depositary for Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable (or its respective nominee), will be considered the holder of the Notes for all purposes
under the Indentures. As such, participants must rely on the procedures of DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
as applicable, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests in order to exercise any rights of
holders of the Notes under the Indentures.

None of the Issuers, the Trustee, the Registrars, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agents nor any of their
respective agents will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry
Interests.

443


-----

**Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indentures, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive Notes in registered
form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”):

(1) if DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary
and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuers within 120 days;

(2) if DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream so requests following an Event of Default (as defined under “Description
_of the Senior Secured Notes” and “Description of the Senior Notes,” as applicable) under the Indentures; or_

(3) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through DTC, Euroclear
or Clearstream following an Event of Default under the Indentures.

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest
described in the immediately preceding clause (3), their current procedure is to request that we issue or cause to
be issued Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests.

In such an event, the Issuers will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and issued in
any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable
(in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants
reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the
restrictive legend as provided in the Indentures, unless that legend is not required by the Indentures or applicable
law.

In the case of the issue of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may transfer
such Definitive Registered Note by surrendering it to the Registrar. In the event of a partial transfer or a partial
redemption of one Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferee
in respect of the part transferred, and a new Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferor or the
holder, as applicable, in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed; provided that a
Definitive Registered Note will only be issued in denominations of $200,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000
in excess thereof (in the case of a Definitive Registered Note relating to the USD Notes) and minimum
denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof (in the case of a Definitive
Registered Note relating to the EUR Notes).

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Notes have
been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and are surrendered
to the Registrar or at the office of the applicable Transfer Agent, we will issue and the Trustee or an
authenticating agent appointed by the Trustee will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the
Trustee’s and our requirements are met. We or the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a
Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee and us to
protect us, the Trustee and the applicable Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the Indentures from any loss which
any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. We and/or the Trustee may charge for
expenses in replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to become
due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by us pursuant to the provisions of the Indentures, we
in our discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such
Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests only in accordance with
the Indentures and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the applicable Transfer Agent a written
certification (in the form provided in the Indentures) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer
restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

To the extent permitted by law, we, the Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agents, the Registrars and any
of their respective agents shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner
thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will
be evidenced through registration from time to time at the registered office of the Issuers, and such registration is
a means of evidencing title to the Notes.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the Book-Entry
Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in DTC or
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable.

-----

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the holders of
the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such
Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will
be equal to the amount received by DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the
redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuers understands that under existing practices of
DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and/or
Clearstream or DTC, as applicable, will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis
(with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate in
accordance with their respective operational procedures; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less
than $200,000 principal amount (in the case of the USD Global Notes) and €100,000 principal amount (in the
case of the EUR Global Notes) at maturity may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

Payments of amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, interest, additional
interest and additional amounts) will be made by the Issuers to the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent will, in turn,
make such payments to DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, which will distribute such payments
to participants in accordance with their respective procedures.

Under the terms of the Indentures governing the Notes, the Issuers, the Trustee, each Paying Agent, each
Transfer Agent, each Registrar and any of their respective agents will treat the registered holder of the Global
Notes (for example, DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or their respective nominees) as the
owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the
Issuers, the Trustee, the Registrars, the Transfer Agents, the Paying Agents nor any of their respective agents has
or will have any responsibility or liability for:

- any aspects of the records of DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or
indirect participant relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest, for any such
payments made by DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or indirect
participant, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of DTC or Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on
account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

- payments made by DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or indirect
participant, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of DTC or Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or indirect participant relating to or payments made on
account of a Book-Entry Interest;

- DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or indirect participant; or

- the records of the custodian or common depositary, as applicable.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility of
such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers registered in “street
name.”

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any regulations of the
applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. None of the Issuers, the Trustee, the Initial Purchasers, the Paying
Agents, the Transfer Agents, the Registrars nor any of their respective agents will be liable to any holder of a
Global Note or any other person for any commissions, costs, losses or expenses in relation to or resulting from
any currency conversion or rounding effected in connection with any such payment. Holders may be subject to
foreign exchange risks that may have economic and tax consequences to them.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the USD Global
Notes will be paid to holders of interests in such Notes through DTC in U.S. dollars. The principal of, premium,
if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the EUR Global Notes will be paid to holders
of interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in euro.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuers that they will take any action permitted to be taken by
a holder of the Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests

445


-----

in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the
Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action
in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an Event of Default under the Notes, each of DTC, Euroclear
and Clearstream reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes in certificated
form, and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to their respective participants.

**Transfers**

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Notes described herein, transfers between
participants in DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, will be done in accordance with DTC, Euroclear
and Clearstream rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of
Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell the Notes to persons in states which require physical
delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder must transfer its interest in the Global Notes
in accordance with the normal procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the
provisions of the Indentures.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Transfer Restrictions.” Book-Entry Interests in the
Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed in “Transfer Restrictions.”

Beneficial interests in a 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note denominated in the same currency only upon receipt by the
Trustee of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indentures) from the transferor to the effect that
such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 or any other exemption (if available
under the Securities Act). Through and including the 40th day after the later of the commencement of the
offering of the Notes and the closing of the Offering (the “distribution compliance period”), Regulation S BookEntry Interests will be limited to persons that have accounts with DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or persons who
hold interests through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, and any sale or transfer of such interest to U.S. persons
shall not be permitted during such period unless such resale or transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A under the
Securities Act. Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to (i) a person who takes delivery in the
form of 144A Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Indentures) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor
reasonably believes is a qualified institutional buyer within the meaning of Rule 144A under the Securities Act in
a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A under the Securities Act or (ii) otherwise in accordance
with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable
securities laws of any other jurisdiction.

Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in “Transfer Restrictions,” Book-Entry Interests may be transferred and
exchanged as described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and
“Description of the Senior Notes—Transfer and Exchange.” Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes
of any series that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in the other
Global Note of such series will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned Global
Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note, and accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all
transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for
as long as it retains such a Book-Entry Interest.

In connection with transfers involving exchanges between Regulation S Book-Entry Interests and 144A BookEntry Interests, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the relevant
Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the other relevant Global Note.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only as
described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and “Description of the
_Senior Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee and the_
Registrar a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indentures) to the effect that such transfer will comply
with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**Information Concerning DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable. The Issuers provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the
convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that
settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuers, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the

446


-----

Paying Agents, the Transfer Agents, the Registrars nor any of their respective agents are responsible for those
operations or procedures.

DTC advised the Issuers that it is a limited purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law,
a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve
System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a
“clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the U.S. Exchange Act. DTC holds and
provides asset servicing for issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity issues, corporate and municipal debt issues, and
money market instruments (that DTC’s direct participants deposit with DTC). DTC also facilitates the post trade
settlement among direct participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities, through
electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between direct participants’ accounts. DTC is a wholly
owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for
DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are
registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system
is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies,
and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant, either
directly or indirectly.

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations and also facilitate the clearance and
settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes
in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants,
including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded
securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream
participants are financial institutions, such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies
and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others, such as
banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a
Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to
persons or entities that do not participate in the DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions
in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some
jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the
ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests
through the DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A
Global Notes only through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed and admitted to trading on the Official List
of the Exchange. Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in DTC, Euroclear or
Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective system’s rules and operating
procedures.

Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream will be
effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective system’s rules and operating procedures.

Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable,
they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be
discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuers, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the
Transfer Agents, the Registrars, the Paying Agents nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility
for the performance by DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants of their
respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the USD Notes will be made in U.S. dollars and initial settlement for the EUR Notes will be
made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the
settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited
to the securities custody accounts of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business day following the
settlement date against payment for value on the settlement date.

447


-----

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in
same day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of
trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure
that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**Special Timing Considerations**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving the Notes through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems are
open for business.

**CERTAIN TAX CONSEQUENCES**

**German Taxation**

The following is a general discussion of certain German tax consequences of the acquisition, holding and
disposal of the Notes. It does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all German tax considerations that
may be relevant to a decision to purchase Notes and, in particular, does not consider any specific facts or
circumstances that may apply to a particular purchaser. This summary is based on the tax laws of Germany
currently in force and as applied on the date of this offering memorandum, which are subject to change, possibly
with retroactive or retrospective effect.

Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences of
the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes, including the effect of any state or local or church taxes
under the tax laws of Germany and any country of which they are residents or whose tax laws apply to them for
other reasons.

**Withholding Tax**

**_Resident holders_**

Ongoing interest payments received by an individual holder of the Notes who is a German tax resident (i.e.
persons whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat or place of effective management is located in Germany)
will be subject to German withholding tax (Kapitalertragsteuer) if the Notes are kept or administered in a
custodial account with or presented for an over the counter payment to a German branch of a German or
non-German bank or financial services institution, securities trading company or securities trading bank (each, a
“Disbursing Agent” auszahlende Stelle). The withholding tax rate to be withheld by the Disbursing Agent is 25%
(plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being 26.375%, plus church tax, if
applicable). Church tax will be collected by the Disbursing Agent by way of withholding unless the holder has
filed a blocking notice (Sperrvermerk) with the German Federal Central Tax Office (Bundeszentralamt für
_Steuern) in which case the holders will have to include the income in the tax return and will then be assessed for_
church tax. The Issuers of the Notes should under German law not be required to deduct withholding tax from the
proceeds of the investment in the Notes.

The same treatment applies to capital gains (i.e., the difference between the proceeds from the disposal,
redemption, repayment or assignment after deduction of expenses directly related to the disposal, redemption,
repayment or assignment and the cost of acquisition taking into account currency gains and losses, if any) and
interest accrued on the Notes (“Accrued Interest,” Stückzinsen) derived by an individual holder who is a German
tax resident irrespective of any holding period provided that the Notes have been held in a custodial account with
the same Disbursing Agent since the time of their acquisition. If interest coupons or interest claims are disposed
of separately (i.e., without the Notes), the proceeds from the disposition are subject to withholding tax. The same
applies to proceeds from the redemption of interest coupons or the payment of interest claims if the Notes have
been disposed of separately.

To the extent that the Notes have not been kept or administered in a custodial account with the same Disbursing
Agent since the time of their acquisition, upon their disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment withholding
tax applies at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being
26.375%, plus church tax, if applicable) on 30% of the disposal proceeds (plus Accrued Interest, if any), unless
the current Disbursing Agent has been provided with evidence of the actual acquisition costs of the Notes by the
previous Disbursing Agent or by a statement of a bank or financial services institution within the European
Union, the EEA or the countries/territories Luxembourg, Austria, the Swiss Confederation, the Principality of
Liechtenstein, the Republic of San Marino, the Principality of Monaco, the Principality of Andorra, Curacao and
Sint Maarten. If the withholding tax on a disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes has been
calculated on the basis of 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather than from the actual gain), a German tax resident
individual holder may also apply for an assessment on the basis of its actual acquisition costs; however, in case
the actual gain is higher than 30% of the disposal proceeds a German tax resident individual holder is obliged to
apply for an assessment on the basis of its actual acquisition costs.

In computing any German withholding tax, the Disbursing Agent may generally deduct from the basis of the
withholding tax negative investment income realized by the individual holder of the Notes via the Disbursing
Agent (e.g., losses from the sale of other securities with the exception of shares). The Disbursing Agent may also
deduct Accrued Interest on the Notes or other securities paid separately upon the acquisition of the respective
security via the Disbursing Agent. In addition, subject to certain requirements and restrictions, the Disbursing

449


-----

Agent may credit foreign withholding taxes levied on investment income in a given year regarding securities held
by the individual holder in the custodial account with the Disbursing Agent.

Upon the individual holder filing an exemption certificate (Freistellungsauftrag) with the Disbursing Agent, the
Disbursing Agent will take a maximum annual allowance (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of €801 (€1,602 for married
couples and for partners in accordance with the registered partnership law (Gesetz über die Eingetragene
_Lebenspartnerschaft) filing jointly) into account when computing the amount of tax to be withheld from the_
gross payment to be made by the Disbursing Agent. No withholding tax will be deducted if the holder of the
Notes has submitted to the Disbursing Agent a certificate of non-assessment (Nichtveranlagungsbescheinigung)
issued by the competent tax authorities.

German withholding tax will generally not apply to gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or
assignment of Notes held by a corporate holder who is a German tax resident (including via a commercial
partnership, as the case may be, and provided that in the case of corporations of certain legal forms the status of
corporation has been evidenced by a certificate of the competent tax authorities) while ongoing payments, such
as interest payments, are subject to withholding tax (irrespective of any deductions of foreign tax and losses
incurred). The same may apply where the Notes form part of a trade or business (of an individual or of a
commercial partnership) subject to further requirements being met.

**_Non-resident holders_**

Non-residents of Germany are, in general, not subject to German withholding tax on investment income and the
solidarity surcharge thereon. However, where the interest or capital gain is subject to German taxation (as
outlined below under “—Taxation of Current Income and Capital Gains—Non Tax Residents”) and the Notes are
held in a custodial account with a German Disbursing Agent, withholding tax will be levied under certain
circumstances. The withholding tax may be refunded based on an assessment to tax or under an applicable tax
treaty (Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen).

**Taxation of Current Income and Capital Gains**

**_Tax Resident holder_**

This subsection “—Tax Residents” refers to persons who are tax residents of Germany (i.e., persons whose
residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, or place of effective management and control is located in Germany).

Income derived from capital investments under the Notes held by an individual holder who is tax resident in
Germany is in general subject to German income tax at a flat-tax rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and
church tax, if applicable, thereon) (Abgeltungsteuer) if the Notes are held as private investment
(Privatvermögen). Individual holders who are tax resident in Germany are entitled to a maximum annual
allowance (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of €801 (€1,602 for married couples and for partners in accordance with the
registered partnership law (Gesetz über die Eingetragene Lebenspartnerschaft) filing jointly), whereby actually
incurred higher expenses directly attributable to a capital investment are not deductible.

The personal income tax liability of an individual holder who is tax resident in Germany on income from capital
investments under the Notes will, in principle, be satisfied by the tax withheld (as described under
“—Withholding Tax” above). To the extent that withholding tax has not been levied, such as in the case of Notes
kept in custody abroad or if no Disbursing Agent being involved in the payment process or if the withholding tax
on disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment has been calculated from 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather
than the actual gain), the individual holder must include its interest income and capital gains derived from the
Notes in its annual tax return and will then also be taxed at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and, where
applicable, church tax thereon). Further, an individual holder may apply for a taxation of all investment income
of a given year at its lower individual tax rate based upon an assessment to tax with any amounts over-withheld
being refunded. In each case, the deduction of expenses (other than transaction costs) on an itemized basis is not
permitted. Losses incurred with respect to the Notes may only be offset with investment income of the individual
holder realized in the same or following assessment periods.

Pursuant to recent legislative changes, losses arising from a bad debt loss (Forderungsausfall), a waiver of a
receivable (Forderungsverzicht) or a transfer of an impaired receivable to a Third-party or from any other default
can only be offset against other income from capital investments and only up to an amount of €10,000 per year.
Respective losses exceeding the amount of €10.000 can be carried forward and might be usable in future tax
periods (together with current capital investment losses of each such tax period) up to an amount of €10.000 per
year.

Where Notes form part of a trade or business of an individual or corporate holder or the income from the Notes
qualifies as income from the letting and leasing of property, the withholding tax, if any, will not satisfy the

450


-----

personal or corporate income tax liability. Rather, the income is subject to individual or corporate income tax
(plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax). Where Notes form part of a trade or business,
interest (including Accrued Interest) and capital gains must be taken into account as income. The respective
holder must include income and related (business) expenses in the annual tax return and the balance will be taxed
at the holder’s applicable tax rate. Withholding tax levied, if any, will be credited as advance payment against the
personal or corporate income tax liability of the holder or, to the extent exceeding this personal or corporate
income tax liability, be refunded. Where Notes form part of a German trade or business the current income and
gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes may also be subject to German trade
tax (Gewerbesteuer). The trade tax liability depends on the municipal trade tax factor (Gewerbesteuerhebesatz).
If the holder is an individual or an individual partner of a partnership, the trade tax may generally be completely
or partly credited against the personal income tax pursuant to a lump sum tax credit method.

**_Non-Tax Resident holder_**

This subsection “—Non-Tax Residents” refers to persons who are not tax residents of Germany (i.e., persons
whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, and place of effective management and control is not located in
Germany).

Interest and capital gains (which include Accrued Interest and currency gains and losses, if any) from the
disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes received by holders who are not tax resident in
Germany are generally not subject to German taxation, unless (i) the Notes form part of the business property of
a permanent establishment, including a permanent representative, or a fixed base maintained in Germany by the
holder or (ii) the income otherwise constitutes German source income (such as income from the letting and
leasing of certain German situs property or income from capital investments directly or indirectly secured by
German situs real estate or income from a hybrid instrument issued by a German tax resident issuer, unless the
Notes qualify as global certificates (Sammelurkunden) within the meaning of Section 9a of the German Custody
Act (Depotgesetz) or as fungible notes representing the same issue (Teilschuldverschreibungen)). We expect the
Notes to qualify for this exception so long as they are held in global form. In cases (i) and (ii) a tax regime
similar to that explained above under “—Tax Residents” applies. Furthermore, the holders who are not tax
resident in Germany may become subject to German withholding tax in case they receive the proceeds by way of
an over the counter payment by a German Disbursing Agent and the Notes are not held in custody with the same
German Disbursing Agent. Subject to certain requirements a holder who is not tax resident in Germany may
benefit from tax reductions or tax exemptions provided by an applicable tax treaty.

**Abolishment of Solidarity Surcharge**

According to a bill enacted in December 2019, the solidarity surcharge will be partially abolished as of the
assessment period 2021 for certain individuals.

**Inheritance and Gift Tax**

A gratuitous transfer of Notes by reason of death or as a gift will be subject to German inheritance or gift tax if
the decedent or donor or the heir, donee or other beneficiary is at the time of the transfer a resident or deemed to
be a resident of Germany. If neither the holder nor the recipient is a resident or deemed to be a resident of
Germany at the time of the transfer, no German inheritance or gift taxes will be levied unless (i) the Notes are
attributable to a German trade or business for which a permanent establishment is maintained or a permanent
representative has been appointed in Germany or (ii) the obligations under the Notes are directly or indirectly
secured by German situs real estate (unless the Notes qualify as fungible notes representing the same issue
(Teilschuldverschreibungen)). We expect the Notes to qualify for this exception so long as they are held in global
form. Exceptions from this rule apply to certain German citizens who previously maintained a residence in
Germany.

**Other Taxes**

No stamp, issue or registration taxes or such duties will be payable in Germany in connection with the issuance,
delivery or execution of the Notes. Currently, net assets tax (Vermögenssteuer) is not levied in Germany.

**The Proposed Financial Transactions Tax**

The EU Commission and certain EU member states (including Germany) are currently intending to introduce a
financial transaction tax (presumably on secondary market transactions involving at least one financial
intermediary). The timing of its potential introduction is, however, still unclear. Prospective holders of the Notes
are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the financial transaction tax.

451


-----

**Proposed Abolishment of German flat taxation on Interest Income**

The German Government intends to abolish the current flat taxation (Abgeltungsteuer) of 25% (plus solidarity
surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being 26.375%, plus church tax, if applicable) on
interest income received by private individuals. As a result, interest on the Notes could become subject to a
taxation at a respective Note holder’s individual personal tax rate (where such noteholder is a tax resident of
Germany) up to a tax rate of 45% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being
26.375%, plus church tax, if applicable).

**Payment by a Guarantor**

If a Guarantor makes any payments in respect of interest on Notes it is possible that such payments may be
subject to withholding tax at applicable rates subject to such relief as may be available under the provisions of
any applicable double taxation treaty or to any other exemption which may apply. It is not certain that such
payments by the Guarantor will be eligible for exemption from withholding tax and that a tax credit will be
available in such case.

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following discussion is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. Holders and
Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below) of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes, but does not
purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects. The summary does not address U.S. federal income
tax consequences to Non-U.S. Holders relating to the EUR Notes or the SUN USD Notes, nor does it address the
effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or
any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws.

This discussion is based upon the tax laws of the United States, including the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations issued thereunder, and judicial and administrative
interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change at any time,
possibly with retroactive effect which could significantly affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences
described below. No rulings from the IRS have been or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters
discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will not take a different position concerning
the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes than those discussed herein or that
any such position would not be sustained in the event of litigation. A different treatment than that assumed below
could adversely affect the amount, timing and character of income, gain or loss in respect of an investment in the
Notes.

This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder
in light of such holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the Medicare contribution tax on net
investment income, special tax accounting rules that apply as a result of gross income with respect to the Notes
being taken into account on an applicable financial statement, or to holders subject to special rules, such as
banks, broker dealers, mutual funds, certain financial institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies,
individual retirement and other tax deferred accounts, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities,
holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax exempt entities, regulated investment companies,
real estate investment trusts, partnerships, subchapter S corporations, or other pass through entities or
arrangements and investors in such entities or arrangements, persons liable for alternative minimum tax, persons
subject to the base erosion and anti-abuse tax, “controlled foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment
companies,” and corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax, entities covered by the
anti-inversion rules and persons holding the Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion transaction” or
other integrated transaction. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase the relevant Notes in
the offering hereby at the “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of such Notes is sold for
money, not including sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of
underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers), and who hold the Notes as capital assets (generally, property
held for investment) within the meaning of section 1221 of the Code.

If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the
U.S. tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the
activities of the partner and the partnership. A partnership considering an investment in the Notes, and partners in
such a partnership, should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes.

The summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations set forth below is for general information
purposes only. Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax

consequences of holding Notes in light of their particular circumstances, including the application of the U.S.
federal income tax considerations discussed below, as well as the application of U.S. federal estate and gift tax
laws and state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws.

**_Additional Payments_**

In certain circumstances (see, e.g., “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Change of Control,” “Description
_of the Senior Notes—Change of Control,” “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Optional Redemption,”_
“Description of the Senior Notes—Optional Redemption,” “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Redemption for Taxation Reasons,” “Description of the Senior Notes—Redemption for Taxation Reasons,”_
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Withholding Taxes” and “Description of the Senior Notes—
_Withholding Taxes”) we may be obligated or elect to pay amounts in excess of stated interest or principal on the_
Notes. Because of the possibility of such payments, the Notes may be treated as contingent payment debt
instruments under the applicable Treasury regulations, in which case the timing and amount of income inclusions
and the character of income recognized may be different from the consequences discussed herein. Although the
issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the possibility of such additional amounts payable
on the Notes is a remote or incidental contingency within the meaning of applicable Treasury regulations as of
the date hereof, and thus does not result in the Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments under
applicable Treasury regulations. Therefore, we do not intend to treat the potential payment of additional interest
or the potential payment of a premium pursuant to the optional redemption, redemption for tax reasons or
withholding tax provisions as part of the yield to maturity of the Notes. Our determination that this contingency
is remote or incidental is binding on a holder, unless such holder explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return
for the year during which it acquires the Notes that it is taking a different position. However, our position is not
binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a contrary position to that described above, among other adverse tax
consequences, a holder may be required to accrue income on its Notes in excess of stated interest, and to treat as
ordinary income rather than capital gain any income recognized on the taxable disposition of a Note, and, with
respect to a U.S. Holder of a EUR Note, to recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to such
income in a manner different than that described below. Holders should consult their tax advisor regarding the
tax consequences if the Notes were treated as contingent payment debt instruments. The discussion below
assumes that the Notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments.

**_IPO Debt Pushdown_**

Under certain circumstances, we may undertake an IPO Debt Pushdown, pursuant to which the Issuers are
entitled to give notice that will automatically operate so that, among other things, the references to such Issuer
and Restricted Subsidiaries shall apply only to the IPO Pushdown Entity and its Restricted Subsidiaries. In such
event, each holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity would be released from its obligations under the
applicable Indenture. In either case, such modifications to the terms of the Notes could be treated for U.S. federal
income tax purposes as a deemed exchange of (i) the Notes as in place prior to such modifications for (ii) new
Notes as in place after such modifications. If such modifications result in a deemed exchange for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, it would generally be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes
in which beneficial owners of the Notes would be required to recognize any gain or loss. Furthermore, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, the new Notes deemed issued in such a deemed exchange could be treated as issued
with original issue discount. In such event, U.S. Holders would be required to include the original issue discount
in their income as it accrues, in advance of the receipt of cash corresponding to such income. In addition, the
determination of whether the deemed new Notes are treated as “contingent payment debt instruments” as a result
of the possibility of additional payments, as further described above under “—Additional Payments,” would be
made at the time of the modification. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the U.S. federal
income tax considerations relating to potential modifications of the Notes in connection with the IPO Debt
Pushdown.

**_Tax Considerations for U.S. Holders of the Notes (including the SSN USD Notes)_**

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation or any entity
taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes created or organized in the United States or under
the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) any estate the income of which is
subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source or (iv) any trust if a court within the United States
is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more “United States
persons” (as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of
the trust, or if the trust has a valid election in place to be treated as a “United States person” (as defined in section
7701(a)(30) of the Code).

**Payments of Stated Interest**

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, payments of stated interest on the Notes (as well as any
additional amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes and without reduction for any amounts withheld)
generally will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the time that such payments are received or
accrued, in accordance with such U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

A U.S. Holder of a EUR Note that uses the cash method of tax accounting will be required to include in income
the U.S. dollar value of the euro denominated interest payment on a EUR Note based on the spot rate of
exchange on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. No
foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be recognized with respect to the receipt of such payment (other than
foreign currency exchange gain or loss realized on the disposition of the euro so received).

A U.S. Holder of a EUR Note that uses the accrual method of tax accounting (or who otherwise is required to
accrue interest prior to receipt) will accrue interest income on a EUR Note in euro and translate the amount
accrued into U.S. dollars based on:

- the average spot rate of exchange in effect during the interest accrual period, or portion thereof, within such
U.S. Holder’s taxable year; or

- at such U.S. Holder’s election, at the spot rate of exchange on (1) the last day of the accrual period, or the
last day of the taxable year within such accrual period if the accrual period spans more than one taxable
year, or (2) the date of receipt, if such date is within five business days of the last day of the accrual period.
Such election must be applied consistently by the U.S. Holder to all debt instruments held by the U.S.
Holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the
U.S. Holder and can be changed only with the consent of the IRS.

A U.S. Holder of a EUR Note that uses the accrual method of tax accounting will recognize foreign currency
exchange gain or loss with respect to a EUR Note on the receipt of an interest payment equal to the difference
between (i) the value of the euro received as interest, as translated into U.S. dollars using the spot rate of
exchange on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars, and
(ii) the U.S. dollar amount previously included in income with respect to such payment. Such foreign currency
exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss, generally will be treated as U.S. source, and
generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income received on a EUR Note.

**_Foreign Tax Credits_**

Any non-U.S. withholding tax with respect to the Notes held by a U.S. Holder at the rate applicable to such
holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, subject to applicable limitations. The calculation of foreign tax credits involves the application of
complex rules that depend on a U.S. Holder’s particular circumstances. U.S. Holders should consult their tax
advisors regarding the availability of foreign tax credits. Interest attributable to a EUR Note or a SUN USD Note
generally will be income from sources outside of the United States and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax
credit, generally will be considered passive category income or, in certain cases, general category income.

**Sale, Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, except as noted below
with respect to foreign currency exchange gain or loss, with respect to a EUR Note a U.S. Holder generally will
recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized by such U.S. Holder (except to
the extent such amount is attributable to accrued but unpaid interest, which will be taxable as described above
under “Tax Considerations for U.S. Holders of the Notes (including the SSN USD Notes)—Payments of Stated
_Interest”) and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such Note. Subject to the discussion below, the adjusted_
tax basis of a Note to a U.S. Holder will generally be, with respect to a USD Note, the original purchase price of
such Note and, with respect to a EUR Note, the U.S. dollar value of the euro purchase price calculated at the spot
rate of exchange on the date of purchase. The amount realized by a U.S. Holder upon the disposition of a Note
will generally be, with respect to a USD Note, the amount received by such U.S. Holder and, with respect to a
EUR Note, the U.S. dollar value of the euros received calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of
disposition.

Any capital gain or loss will be long term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Notes
exceeds one year on the date of disposition. Long term capital gains recognized by non-corporate U.S. Holders
are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. Capital gain or loss, if any, recognized by a U.S. Holder generally will
be treated as U.S. source income or loss for purposes of calculating the U.S. foreign tax credit limitation. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

454


-----

If the EUR Notes are traded on an established securities market, a U.S. Holder that uses the cash method of tax
accounting, and if it so elects, a U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of tax accounting, will determine the
U.S. dollar values of its adjusted tax bases in a EUR Note and the amount realized on the disposition of a EUR
Note by translating euro amounts at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase or the
disposition, respectively. The election available to accrual basis U.S. Holders discussed above must be applied
consistently by the U.S. Holder to all debt instruments from year to year and can be changed only with the
consent of the IRS.

An accrual basis U.S. Holder of EUR Notes that does not make the special election generally will recognize
foreign currency exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange fluctuations between the disposition
date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute U.S. source ordinary income or loss.

Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition
of a EUR Note generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss to the extent that the gain or loss is
attributable to changes in the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate during the period in which the U.S. Holder held
such EUR Note. Such foreign currency exchange gain or loss will equal the difference between the U.S. dollar
value of the euro purchase price calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the date (1) the EUR Note is disposed
of (or the spot rate on the settlement date, if applicable) and (2) of purchase (or the spot rate on the settlement
date, if applicable). In addition, upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a
EUR Note, a U.S. Holder may realize foreign currency exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received
with respect to previously accrued but unpaid interest, which will be treated as discussed above under “Tax
_Considerations for U.S. Holders of the Notes (including the SSN USD Notes)—Payments of Stated Interest.” The_
recognition of foreign currency exchange gain or loss described in this paragraph will be limited to the amount of
overall gain or loss realized on the disposition of a EUR Note, and will be treated as ordinary income generally
from sources within the United States for U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes.

**Reportable Transactions**

Under applicable Treasury regulations, a U.S. Holder who participates in “reportable transactions” (as defined in
the Treasury regulations) must attach to its U.S. federal income tax return a disclosure statement on IRS Form
8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement). The Treasury regulations could be interpreted to cover
transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters, including certain foreign currency transactions. Under the
relevant rules, a U.S. Holder may be required to treat a foreign currency exchange loss from the EUR Notes as a
reportable transaction if this loss exceeds the relevant threshold in the Treasury regulations. U.S. Holders should
consult their tax advisors to determine the tax reporting obligations, if any, including any requirement to file IRS
Form 8886, with respect to the ownership or disposition of the EUR Notes or any related transaction such as the
disposition of any Euros received in respect of the EUR Notes.

**Information Reporting and Backup Withholding**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of principal and interest on the Notes and
to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of a Note paid to a U.S.
Holder unless such U.S. Holder is an exempt recipient (such as a corporation), and, when required, provides
evidence of such exemption. The payer (which may be us or an intermediate payer) will be required to impose
backup withholding, currently at a rate of 24%, on such payments if (1) the U.S. Holder fails to furnish an
accurate taxpayer identification number or to establish an exemption from backup withholding; (2) the IRS
notifies the payer that the taxpayer identification number furnished by the U.S. Holder is incorrect; (3) there has
been a “notified payee underreporting” described in section 3406(c) of the Code; or (4) the U.S. Holder has not
certified under penalties of perjury that it has furnished a correct taxpayer identification number, that it is a
“United States person” (as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code), and that the IRS has not notified such
U.S. Holder that it is subject to backup withholding under the Code. Backup withholding is not an additional tax
and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a
U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability provided that the required information is timely furnished to the
IRS. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of the backup withholding
rules on their particular circumstances.

**Information with Respect to Foreign Financial Assets**

Certain U.S. Holders who are individuals and who hold an interest in “specified foreign financial assets” (as
defined in section 6038D of the Code) are required to report information relating to an interest in the EUR Notes
or the SUN USD Notes, subject to certain exceptions (including an exception for EUR Notes held in accounts
maintained by certain financial institutions). Under certain circumstances, an entity may be treated as an
individual for purposes of the foregoing rules. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the effect,
if any, of this requirement on their ownership and disposition of the Notes.

**_Tax Considerations for Non-U.S. Holders of SSN USD Notes_**

For purposes of this discussion, a “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a SSN USD Note that is, for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, an individual, corporation, estate or trust that is not a U.S. Holder. For
purposes of the following discussion, interest on the SSN USD Notes, and gain on the sale, exchange, retirement,
redemption or other taxable disposition of the SSN USD Notes, will be considered “U.S. trade or business
income” of a Non-U.S. Holder if such income or gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or
business in the United States by such Non-U.S. Holder (and, if required by an applicable treaty, attributable to a
permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder in the United States).

**_Payments of Stated Interest_**

Subject to the discussion below under “—Information Reporting and Backup Withholding” and “—Foreign
Account Tax Compliance”, a Non-U.S. Holder of SSN USD Notes will not be subject to U.S. federal income or
withholding tax in respect of payments of stated interest on the SSN USD Notes if such interest qualifies for the
“portfolio interest exemption.” This will be the case if each of the following requirements is satisfied:

- the interest is not U.S. trade or business income of the Non-U.S. Holder;

- the Non-U.S. Holder does not actually or constructively own stock possessing 10% or more of the combined
voting power of all classes of stock of the USD SSN Issuer;

- the Non-U.S. Holder is not a controlled foreign corporation, within the meaning of the Code, that is actually
or constructively related to the USD SSN Issuer through sufficient stock ownership; and

- the Non-U.S. Holder complies with the certification requirement described below.

The certification requirement generally will be satisfied if the Non-U.S. Holder provides the applicable withholding
agent with a statement on IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or suitable substitute form), together with
all appropriate attachments, signed under penalties of perjury, identifying the Non-U.S. Holder and stating, among
other things, that the Non-U.S. Holder is not a United States person. Prospective Non-U.S. Holders should consult
their tax advisors regarding alternative methods for satisfying the certification requirement.

If the requirements of the portfolio interest exemption are not satisfied with respect to a Non-U.S. Holder of SSN
USD Notes, a 30% U.S. federal income withholding tax will apply to interest paid on the SSN USD Notes to
such Non-U.S. Holder, unless another exemption is applicable. For example, an applicable income tax treaty may
reduce or eliminate such tax, in which event a Non-U.S. Holder claiming the benefit of such treaty must provide
the withholding agent with a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or suitable
substitute form). Alternatively, an exemption applies if the interest is U.S. trade or business income of the
Non-U.S. Holder and the Non-U.S. Holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly executed
IRS Form W-8ECI (or suitable substitute form). If the interest is U.S. trade or business income of a Non-U.S.
Holder, such Non-U.S. Holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to all interest on
the SSN USD Note in the same manner as U.S. Holders, as described above, unless an applicable income tax
treaty provides otherwise. Additionally, Non-U.S. Holders that are corporations generally will be subject to a
branch profits tax with respect to any earnings and profits attributable to such U.S. trade or business (subject to
adjustments) at a rate of 30% (or at a reduced rate under an applicable income tax treaty).

**_Sale, Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of the SSN USD Notes_**

Subject to the discussion below under “—Information Reporting and Backup Withholding” and “—Foreign
_Account Tax Compliance”, generally, a Non-U.S. Holder of SSN USD Notes will not be subject to U.S. federal_
income tax on any gain recognized on the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a
SSN USD Note, unless (i) such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days
or more in the taxable year of the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition and certain
other conditions are met (in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or
lower applicable treaty rate)) or (ii) the gain is U.S. trade or business income of the Non-U.S. Holder. If the gain
is U.S. trade or business income of the Non-U.S. Holder, the Non-U.S. Holder generally will be subject to U.S.
federal income tax with respect to such gain in the same manner as U.S. Holders, as described above, unless an
applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise. Additionally, Non-U.S. Holders that are corporations generally
will be subject to a branch profits tax with respect to any earnings and profits attributable to such U.S. trade or
business (subject to adjustments) at a rate of 30% (or at a reduced rate under an applicable income tax treaty).

To the extent the proceeds from the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a SSN
USD Note represent accrued and unpaid interest, the Non-U.S. Holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal
income tax with respect to such accrued and unpaid interest in the same manner as described above under “Tax
_Considerations for Non-U.S. Holders of SSN USD Notes —Payments of Stated Interest”_

456


-----

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

Amounts of interest paid to a Non-U.S. Holder on a SSN USD Note, and amounts withheld from such payments,
if any, generally will be required to be reported to the IRS and to such holder.

U.S. backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%) generally will not apply to payments of interest on a note to
a Non-U.S. Holder if the statement described above under “Tax Considerations for Non-U.S. Holders of SSN
_USD Notes—Payments of Stated Interest” is duly provided by such holder or such holder otherwise establishes_
an exemption.

Payments to a Non-U.S. Holder of the proceeds of a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable
disposition of a SSN USD Note effected by the U.S. office of a U.S. or foreign broker will be subject to
information reporting requirements and backup withholding unless such holder properly certifies under penalties
of perjury as to such holder’s non-U.S. status and certain other conditions are met or such holder otherwise
establishes an exemption. Backup withholding generally will not apply to any payment to a Non-U.S. Holder of
the proceeds of the disposition of a SSN USD Note effected outside the United States by a non-U.S. office of a
broker. However, unless such a broker has documentary evidence in its records as to such Non-U.S. Holder’s
non-U.S. status and certain other conditions are met, or such holder otherwise establishes an exemption,
information reporting will apply to a payment of the proceeds of the disposition of a SSN USD Note effected
outside the United States by such a broker if the broker:

- is a United States person;

- derived 50% or more of its gross income for certain periods from the conduct of a trade or business in the
United States;

- is a controlled foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes; or

- is a foreign partnership that, at any time during its taxable year, has more than 50% of its

- income or capital interests owned by United States persons or is engaged in the conduct of a U.S. trade or
business.

Any amount withheld under the backup withholding rules is allowable as a credit against a Non-U.S. Holder’s
U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, and a refund may be obtained if amounts withheld exceed such holder’s
actual U.S. federal income tax liability and if the proper information is timely provided to the IRS.

**Foreign Account Tax Compliance**

Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (“FATCA”)
generally impose a withholding tax (currently at a rate of 30%) on U.S. source interest income paid on a debt
obligation, certain foreign passthru payments and, subject to regulatory relief described below, on the gross
proceeds from the sale or other disposition of a debt obligation, in each case, to (i) a foreign financial institution
(as the beneficial owner or as an intermediary for the beneficial owner), unless such institution enters into an
agreement with the United States government to collect and provide to the United States tax authorities
substantial information regarding United States account holders of such institution (which would include certain
equity and debt holders of such institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with United
States owners) or (ii) a foreign entity that is not a financial institution (as the beneficial owner or as an
intermediary for the beneficial owner), unless such entity provides the withholding agent with a certification
identifying the substantial U.S. owners of the entity, which generally includes any “United States person” (as
defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) who directly or indirectly owns more than 10% of the entity, in each
case, unless another exemption applies; provided that such withholding tax would only apply with respect to
Notes other than the SSN USD Notes if such interest income or gross proceeds are treated as passthru payments
attributable to certain U.S. source payments. Holders are encouraged to consult with their tax advisors regarding
the implications of FATCA on their investment in a Note.

Obligations that do not pay U.S. source interest issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on
which applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru payments are published generally would be
“grandfathered” unless materially modified after such date. Accordingly, for the EUR Notes and the SUN USD
Notes, if the relevant Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution, FATCA would apply to payments on such
series of the Notes only if there is a significant modification of the Notes of such series for U.S. federal income
tax purposes after the expiration of this grandfathering period. Non-U.S. governments have entered into
agreements with the United States (and additional non-U.S. governments are expected to enter into such
agreements) to implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described herein. Under proposed Treasury
regulations that may be relied upon pending finalization, the withholding tax on gross proceeds would be
eliminated and, consequently, FATCA withholding on gross proceeds is not currently expected to apply.

THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS A GENERAL SUMMARY. IT DOES NOT COVER ALL TAX MATTERS
THAT MAY BE OF IMPORTANCE TO A PARTICULAR INVESTOR. EACH PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR
SHOULD CONSULT ITS TAX ADVISOR ABOUT THE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO IT OF AN
INVESTMENT IN THE NOTES IN LIGHT OF THE INVESTOR’S OWN CIRCUMSTANCES.

**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND**
**ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTE GUARANTEES AND SECURITY INTERESTS**

**European Union**

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) No. 2015/848 of May 20, 2015 (the “Recast Insolvency Regulation”), replacing
Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000 on insolvency proceedings, as amended (the “EU
Insolvency Regulation”) and starting from June 26, 2017, the court which shall have jurisdiction to open the main
insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the member state of the European Union, other
than Denmark, (a “Regulated Member State”) within the territory of which the company concerned has its
“center of main interests.”

In the case of a company or legal person, the place of the registered office shall be presumed to be its center of
main interests in the absence of proof to the contrary (Article 3(1) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation). That
presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another Regulated Member State
within the three month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. In addition, that
presumption is rebuttable, and the relevant court of a Regulated Member State should carefully assess whether
the center of main interests is genuinely located in that Regulated Member State. Specifically, it should be
possible to rebut the presumption where the company’s central administration is located in a Regulated Member
State other than that of its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors
establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management
and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other Regulated Member State (Recital
(30) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation). When determining whether the center of main interests is
ascertainable by third parties, special consideration should be given to the creditors and to their perception as to
where a company conducts the administration of its interests. This may require, in the event of a shift of center of
main interests, informing creditors of the new location from which the company is carrying out its activities in
due course, for example by drawing attention to the change of address in commercial correspondence, or by
making the new location public through other appropriate means (Recital (28) of the Recast Insolvency
Regulation).

If the center of main interests of the debtor is located in the Regulated Member State in which it has its registered
office, the main insolvency proceedings under the Recast Insolvency Regulation shall be opened in that
Regulated Member State and accordingly the courts of that Regulated Member State shall have jurisdiction to
open any of the insolvency proceedings applicable in that Regulated Member State (see Annex A of the Recast
Insolvency Regulation).

Notwithstanding the opening of a main insolvency proceeding in a Regulated Member State, “secondary
insolvency proceedings” may be opened in another Regulated Member State if such debtor possesses an
“establishment” (as defined in Article 2(10) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation) in that Member State. The
effects of these proceedings shall be restricted to the assets of the debtor in the territory of that Regulated
Member State.

If the debtor possesses an “establishment” in a Regulated Member State, “territorial proceedings” under
Article 3(4) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation may be opened prior to the opening of main insolvency
proceedings, where (a) main insolvency proceedings cannot be opened because of the conditions laid down by
the law of the Regulated Member State within the territory of which the center of the debtor’s main interests is
situated or (b) the opening of territorial insolvency proceedings is requested by (i) a creditor whose claim arises
from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Regulated
Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested or (ii) a public authority which, under the
law of the Regulated Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to
request the opening of insolvency proceedings. When main insolvency proceedings are opened, the territorial
insolvency proceedings shall become secondary insolvency proceedings.

In the event that the Issuers or any provider of collateral experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to
predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings will be commenced,
or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations
of the Issuers and the collateral provided by the Issuers or any other company. The insolvency, administration
and other laws of the jurisdictions in which the respective companies are organized or operate may be materially
different from, or conflict with, each other and there is no assurance as to how the insolvency laws of the
potentially involved jurisdictions will be applied in relation to one another.

**Germany**

**_Insolvency_**

The EUR SSN Issuer, the SUN Issuer and certain Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany, have
their registered offices in Germany and substantially all of their assets are located in Germany. In the event of an
insolvency of the EUR SSN Issuer, the SUN Issuer or a Guarantor organized under the laws of Germany and/or
having its “center of main interests” in Germany (any other such Guarantor, a “German Notes Guarantor”) at the
time the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) is filed, any main
insolvency proceedings would most likely be initiated in Germany. Such proceedings would then be governed by
German law. Under certain circumstances, insolvency proceedings may also be opened in Germany in
accordance with German law over the assets of companies that are not established under German law (for
example, if the center of main interests of such company is within Germany) or, vice versa, insolvency over the
EUR SSN Issuer, the SUN Issuer or the German Notes Guarantors may be opened in other jurisdictions. See
“—European Union.”

The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung), may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors than the insolvency laws of the United
States or another jurisdiction with which you may be familiar, including in respect of priority of creditors’
claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest as well as in certain circumstances priority recovery for secured
creditors and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and thus may limit your ability to recover payments due
on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany:

Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court ex
officio, but require that the debtor and/or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings.
Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of over indebtedness
(Überschuldung) of the debtor or in the event of its illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit), meaning that the debtor is
unable to pay 10% or more of its debts as and when they fall due for a period longer than three weeks. According
to the relevant provision of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), a debtor is over indebted when its
liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation values), unless a continuation of the debtor’s
business as a going concern is predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich) based on an up to two year
forecast horizon (positive Fortführungsprognose). If a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter
_Haftung), a public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft), a European law stock corporation based in_
Germany (Societas Europaea) or any other company not having an individual as personally liable shareholder or
partner finds itself in a situation of illiquidity and/or over indebtedness, the management board or managing
director(s) of such company and, in certain circumstances, its shareholders, are obligated to file for insolvency
without undue delay but not later than three weeks after such illiquidity and/or over indebtedness occurred or (as
the case may be) was established. Noncompliance with these obligations exposes management to both severe
damages claims as well as sanctions under criminal law. In addition, only the debtor, but not the creditors, can
file for the opening of insolvency proceedings in the event of imminent illiquidity (drohende
_Zahlungsunfähigkeit), if there is the imminent risk of the company being unable to pay its debts as and when they_
fall due at some point in time within a certain prognosis period, whereas imminent illiquidity does not give rise to
an obligation for the management of the debtor to file for insolvency proceedings.

The Act to Temporarily Suspend the Obligation to File for Insolvency and to Limit Directors’ Liability in the
Case of Insolvency Caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic, which was adopted on March 27, 2020 (the
“COVInsAG”), provides for a suspension of the obligation to file for insolvency until September 30, 2020. The
suspension applies unless the insolvency is not caused by consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic or there is
no prospect of remedying the existing illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit). If the debtor was able to pay its debts on
December 31, 2019—so that the debtor was not illiquid (zahlungsunfähig)—it is assumed that the insolvency
was caused by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and that there are prospects of remedying an existing
illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit). The COVInsAG also provides that insolvency proceedings based on creditors’
insolvency filings in the period from March 28, 2020 to June 28, 2020 can only be opened if the event of
illiquidity or over indebtedness already existed on March 1, 2020. The Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer
Protection will be authorized by regulation to extend the suspension of the filing obligation and the suspension of
creditors’ insolvency filings until March 31, 2021 if this appears to be necessary due to the continuing demand
for available public aid, ongoing financing difficulties, or other circumstances. The COVInsAG also provides for
a relief from claw-back for the repayment of loans provided during the suspension period or the provision of
collateral for these claims. The same applies to payments which the creditor was entitled to receive or similar

transactions unless the creditor knew that the restructuring and refinancing efforts of the debtor were not suitable
to eliminate an existing illiquidity of the debtor in the meaning of section 17 of the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung).

The insolvency proceedings are controlled by the competent insolvency court, which monitors the due
performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take
preliminary measures to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings
(Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce
individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings insofar as these protective
measures are reasonable to protect the debtor’s assets and/or to ensure the continuation of the debtor’s business.

Unless the debtor has applied for debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) (in which event the court
will generally only appoint a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter) who will supervise the management of
the affairs by the debtor) the insolvency court will in most cases appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator
(vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter). The rights and duties of the preliminary administrator depend on the decision
of the court. The duties of the preliminary administrator may include safeguarding and preserving the debtor’s
property and assessing whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover at least the costs of the
insolvency proceedings. Depending on the decision of the court, even the right to manage the business and
dispose of the assets of the debtor may pass to the preliminary insolvency administrator. The insolvency court
can also order a stay of all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors against the debtor and other measures
the court sees as appropriate.

If a company faces imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and/or is over indebted (überschuldet),
but not illiquid (zahlungsunfähig), it may also file for preliminary “debtor in possession” moratorium
proceedings (Schutzschirmverfahren) unless—from a third party perspective—there is no reasonable chance for a
successful restructuring. Upon such filing by the debtor, the court will appoint a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger
_Sachwalter) and prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to immoveable assets). It may also_
implement other preliminary measures to protect the debtor from creditor enforcement actions for up to three
months. During that period, the debtor shall prepare an insolvency plan which ideally shall be implemented in
formal “debtor in possession” proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) after formal insolvency proceedings have been
opened.

During preliminary insolvency proceedings, the insolvency court has to appoint a “preliminary creditors’
committee” (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss) if the debtor satisfies at least two of the following three
requirements:

- a balance sheet total in excess of €6,000,000 (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor is over
indebted);

- revenues of at least €12,000,000 in the twelve months prior to the last day of the financial year preceding the
filing; and/or

- fifty or more employees on an annualized average basis.

The preliminary creditors’ committee will be able to participate in certain important decisions made in the
preliminary insolvency proceedings. It will have, for example, the power to influence the following: the selection
of a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter)/preliminary trustee (vorläufiger
_Sachwalter) and an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter)/ trustee (Sachwalter); and court orders for_
“debtor in possession” proceedings (Anordnung der Eigenverwaltung).

The court opens formal insolvency proceedings (Eröffnung des Insolvenzverfahrens) if certain formal
requirements are met, including if (i) the debtor is in a situation of imminent illiquidity (if the petition has been
filed by the debtor), illiquidity and/or over indebtedness and (ii) if there are sufficient assets to cover at least the
cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient to cover such
costs, the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if third parties (e.g., creditors), advance
the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings
will usually be refused for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse).

Unless the court has granted debtor in possession status (Eigenverwaltung) (in which case the court will only
appoint a trustee (Sachwalter) who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor), upon opening of
the insolvency proceedings, the court will appoint an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) who has full
administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s assets, whereas the debtor is no longer entitled to dispose
of its assets. The insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) will only be entitled to change the individual

461


-----

appointed as insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste
_Gläubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by heads and amount_
of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual to become insolvency administrator and
(ii) the proposed individual being eligible as officeholder, i.e., sufficiently qualified, business experienced and
impartial. The insolvency administrator (or in the case of debtor in possession proceedings, the debtor) may raise
new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s operations, and satisfaction of these
liabilities as preferential debts of the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) will be preferred to any insolvency
liabilities created by the debtor including the Note Guarantees.

The insolvency administrator or trustee may also challenge transactions that are deemed detrimental to
insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the opening of the insolvency proceedings (See
“—Hardening Periods, Fraudulent Transfer and Amendments of German Restructuring Laws by the
_Restructuring Directive”)._

For the holders of the Notes, the consequences of the opening of German insolvency proceedings against the
EUR SSN Issuer, the SUN Issuer or any German Notes Guarantor subject to the German insolvency regime
would include the following:

(a) unless the court orders debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), the right to administer and
dispose of the EUR SSN Issuer’s, the SUN Issuer’s or a German Notes Guarantor’s assets would generally
pass to the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the insolvency estate;

(b) unless the court orders debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), disposals effected by the EUR
SSN Issuer’s, the SUN Issuer’s or a German Notes Guarantor’s management after the opening of insolvency
proceedings are null and void by operation of law;

(c) if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings, a creditor in the
insolvency proceedings acquires through execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest in part of the
debtor’s property that would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and
void by operation of law upon the opening of the insolvency proceedings;

(d) claims against the EUR SSN Issuer, the SUN Issuer or any German Notes Guarantor may generally only be
pursued in accordance with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung); and

(e) any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderung), i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not
constitute part of the insolvency estate, does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for
separation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency
administrator.

Certain of these consequences could be achieved by decision of the insolvency court following the insolvency
petition and prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings.

Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses” entitling one
party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, upon the opening of
insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the occurrence of reasons
justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte oder Lösungsklauseln)
may be invalid if they frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator whether or not to perform the
contract (Wahlrecht des Insolvenzverwalters) unless they reflect termination rights applicable under statutory
law. This may also relate to agreements that are not governed by German law.

All other creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to segregate an asset from the
insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) or are preferred creditors (Massegläubiger) as opposed to a preferential
right (Absonderungsrecht)), who wish to assert claims against the debtor need to participate in the insolvency
proceedings and have to file their claims against the debtor and the rights they claim in the assets of the debtor
with the insolvency administrator. With the exception of certain secured creditors, an individual enforcement
action brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is subject to an automatic stay once the insolvency
proceedings have been opened (and, if so ordered by a court, also between the time when an insolvency petition
is filed and the time when insolvency proceedings commence). German insolvency proceedings are collective
proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims in the insolvency proceedings
separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung). Accordingly, unsecured creditors may file their claims in the insolvency proceedings and
will be paid on a pro rata basis from the insolvency estate (to the extent sufficient assets are available). Secured
creditors are generally not entitled to enforce their security interests after insolvency proceedings have been
commenced to the extent the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) authorizes the insolvency

462

administrator to dispose of the relevant collateral but have only certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte)
in the insolvency proceedings. In this case, secured creditors will only have a right to claim the recoveries (minus
costs and fees) from such realization. Whether or not, after the initiation of insolvency proceedings, a secured
creditor remains entitled to enforce security granted to it by the relevant debtor depends on the type of security:
The insolvency administrator generally has the sole right (i) to realize any movable assets within its possession
that are subject to preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) (e.g., pledges over movable assets and rights
(Mobiliarpfandrechte), transfer by way of security (Sicherungsübereignung)) and (ii) to collect any claims that
are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). According to some voices in legal
literature, it is uncertain whether the secured creditors are entitled to initiate the enforcement process in respect
of pledged uncertificated shares on their own or, insofar as the pledged assets are part of any insolvency estate,
whether the insolvency administrator has standing to realize the pledges on behalf of and for the benefit of the
secured creditors. However, there is no authoritative case law on this question.

Even if the law vests the right of disposal regarding the relevant collateral in the insolvency administrator, the
secured creditor retains the right of preferred satisfaction with regard to the disposal proceeds
(Absonderungsrecht). Consequently, the enforcement proceeds minus certain contributory charges of 9% (or
more as agreed upon individually) for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets and (ii) realizing the secured
assets are paid to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its
secured claims. Remaining amounts (“excess proceeds”) will be allocated to the insolvency estate
(Insolvenzmasse) and would, after deduction of the costs of the insolvency proceedings (e.g., fees for and
expenses of the preliminary insolvency administrator, the insolvency administrator and the insolvency court as
well as the members of the creditors’ committee) and after satisfaction of certain preferential liabilities be
distributed among the non-preferential unsecured creditors, including the holders of the Notes (to the extent not
satisfied after enforcement of the Collateral securing the Notes). If the EUR SSN Issuer, the SUN Issuer or a
German Notes Guarantor or a subsidiary subject to German insolvency proceedings grants security over its assets
to creditors other than the holders of the Notes, such security may result in a preferred satisfaction of creditors
secured by such security (however, the preferential treatment would be limited to the proceeds obtained through
the disposal of the relevant collateral). The excess proceeds resulting from such collateral may not be sufficient
to satisfy the obligations under the Notes by the EUR SSN Issuer, the SUN Issuer or the German Notes
Guarantors after such secured creditors have been satisfied.

The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the insolvency
administrator from using a movable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency administrator, however,
must compensate the creditor in accordance with specific rules.

In addition, it may take several years before proceeds from the liquidation of the insolvency estate, if any, are
distributed to unsecured creditors. A different distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an
insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and which
requires, in principle, the consent of the debtor as well as the consent of each class of creditors in accordance
with specific majority rules. Under German insolvency laws, it is possible to implement a debt to equity swap
through an insolvency plan. However, it will not be possible to force a creditor into a debt to equity conversion if
it does not consent to such debt to equity swap. In case of protective shield proceedings (Schutzschirmverfahren),
upon request of the debtor, the court will prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to immovable
assets) and may implement other preliminary measures to protect the debtor from credit enforcement actions for
up to three months in order to allow the debtor to prepare an insolvency plan if an independent expert testifies
that the restructuring of the debtor’s business is not obviously futile (offensichtlich aussichtslos) and that the
debtor is not already illiquid.

Under German insolvency law, there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies in
the event of insolvency. In the case of a group of companies, each entity, from an insolvency law point of view,
has to be dealt with separately. As a consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims among the
respective entities of a group, but rather claims of and vis à vis each entity have to be dealt with separately.

Under the act to facilitate the mastering of group insolvencies (Gesetz zur Erleichterung der Bewältigung von
_Konzerninsolvenzen), which came into force on April 21, 2018, however, the coordination of and cooperation_
between insolvency proceedings of group companies are facilitated. Whereas this act does not provide for a
consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a consolidation of the assets
and liabilities of a group of companies or pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, it stipulates
four key amendments of the German Insolvency Code in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group
insolvencies: (i) a single court may assume jurisdiction for other group company insolvency proceedings
(Gruppen Gerichtsstand); (ii) a single person may be appointed as insolvency administrator for all relevant group

463


-----

companies is facilitated; (iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency
administrators and creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for “coordination proceedings”
(Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a “coordinator” (Verfahrenskoordinator) with the ability to
propose a “coordination plan” (Koordinationsplan).

As a general principle, the claims arising from the Notes or a guarantee may be enforced against the EUR SSN
Issuer, the SUN Issuer or a German Notes Guarantor outside of the insolvency proceedings over the assets of the
EUR SSN Issuer, the SUN Issuer or the relevant German Notes Guarantor, as applicable. Any insolvency
proceeding over the assets of the EUR SSN Issuer or the SUN Issuer would, however, be a rather strong
indication that the overall financial situation of the entire group of affiliated companies has significantly
deteriorated, which may cause a German Notes Guarantor to subsequently file for insolvency.

German insolvency law provides for certain creditors and their claims to be subordinated by law (including, but
not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor for the return of repayment
of shareholder loans or comparable actions). The restrictive nature of the covenants and undertakings in the
Indentures may result in the holders of the Notes and/or the applicable Trustee being considered in a
“shareholder like position” (gesellschafterähnliche Stellung). In that event, in an insolvency proceeding over the
assets of the EUR SSN Issuer, the SUN Issuer or a German Notes Guarantor, the claims arising from the Notes or
a Note Guarantee would be treated as a subordinated insolvency claim (nachrangige Insolvenzforderungen).
Subordinated insolvency claims are not eligible to participate in the insolvency proceedings over the assets of the
EUR SSN Issuer, the SUN Issuer or a German Notes Guarantor unless the insolvency court handling the case has
granted special permission allowing these subordinated insolvency claims to be filed which is not granted in the
vast majority of insolvency cases governed by German law. Claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the
insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to the claims of regular,
unsecured creditors.

Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon
the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such time unless
and until the insolvency administrator opts for performance.

_Limitations on Enforcement_

Some of the German Notes Guarantors are incorporated in Germany in the form of a limited liability company
(Gesellschaft _mit_ _beschränkter_ _Haftung—”GmbH”)_ and/or a stock corporation (“Aktiengesellschaft”).
Consequently, the granting of guarantees, indemnities and security interests by these companies is subject to
certain provisions of the German Limited Liability Company Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit
_beschränkter Haftung, “GmbHG”), the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) and other laws. These_
provisions would also apply to any future German Notes Guarantor in the form of a GmbH or a partnership with
a GmbH as unlimited liability partner (e.g., GmbH & Co. KG) or Aktiengesellschaft.

_German GmbH Limitation Language—General_

As a general rule, sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (“Sections 30 and 31”) prohibit a GmbH from disbursing its
assets to its direct or indirect shareholders, to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s net assets (i.e., assets
minus liabilities and liability reserves) is already less or would fall below the amount of its stated share capital
(Stammkapital). The granting or enforcement of guarantees or security interests by a GmbH in order to guarantee
or secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company may be considered disbursements under
Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to issue guarantees or create security
interests to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Sections
30 and 31, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to
contain “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries in the legal form of a GmbH or partnership with a GmbH
as unlimited liable partner incorporated or established in Germany. Pursuant to such limitation language, the
beneficiaries of the guarantees or the security interests agree, subject to certain adjustments and exemptions, to
enforce the guarantees or the security interests against the German subsidiary only to the extent that such
enforcement does not result in the GmbH’s (or, in case of a partnership with a GmbH as unlimited liable partner,
such GmbH’s) net assets falling below its stated share capital or, as the case may be, if the net assets are already
below the amount of its stated share capital, to cause such amount to be further reduced. Accordingly, the Note
Guarantee, the Indenture and the Security Documents provided by the German Notes Guarantors contains or will
contain, respectively, such limitation language and therefore the enforcement of the Note Guarantees, the
Indenture and the Collateral is limited in the manner described. This could lead to a situation in which the
respective guarantee or security granted by the relevant German Notes Guarantor cannot be enforced at all.

464


-----

_German AG Limitation Language—General_

As a general rule, Section 57 German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) prohibits the disbursement of the
deposits to the stockholders (Verbot der Einlagenrückgewähr). In addition, pursuant to Section 71a German
Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) the relevant German public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft)
may not grant any loan or grant and security to a third party for purposes of the acquisition of the stock in such
German public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft). Any agreement in such respect is void.

Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to issue guarantees or create security interests to secure
liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Section 57 German Stock
Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) and/or Section 71 a German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz), it is standard
market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain “limitation
language” in relation to subsidiaries in the legal form of a German public limited liability company
(Aktiengesellschaft). Pursuant to such limitation language, the beneficiaries of the guarantees or the security
interests agree to enforce the guarantees or the security interests against the German subsidiary only to the extent
that such enforcement does not lead to a violation of Section 57 German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz)
and/or Section 71 a German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz). Accordingly, the Note Guarantee, the
Indenture and the Security Documents relating to the Collateral provided by the German Notes Guarantors
contains or will contain, respectively, such limitation language and therefore the enforcement of the Note
Guarantees and the Indenture is limited in the manner described below. This could lead to a situation in which
the respective guarantee or security granted by the relevant German Notes Guarantor cannot be enforced at all. In
particular, thyssenkrupp Elevator, is incorporated in Germany in the form of a German public limited liability
company (Aktiengesellschaft). As all the Note Guarantors are direct or indirect subsidiaries of thyssenkrupp
Elevator, all limitations applicable to a German public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft) (whether by
virtue of law or contractual limitation language) will consequently also apply to such subsidiaries even if
incorporated in a legal form other than a German public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft). See also
“Risk Factors—Risks Relating to each Series of the Notes and the Senior Secured Notes—Corporate benefit,
_financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Collateral_
_may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral.”_

(B) the AG Guarantor and the relevant Obligor whose obligations are secured by the relevant Limited
Upstream Obligation are both Subsidiaries of a joint (direct or indirect) parent company with such
parent company as dominating entity (herrschendes Unternehmen),

in each case unless the mere existence of such a DPLA does not lead to the inapplicability of § 57 (1)
and § 71a AktG (in connection with § 278 (3) AktG and/or Art. 5 SE Regulation, as applicable) as

explicitly confirmed with reasons (and not, for example, as an obiter dictum) by the Federal Court of
Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) in a third party case; and the loss compensation claim
(Verlustausgleichsanspruch) of the AG Guarantor under such a DPLA would not be, or cannot be
expected to be, fully valuable and recoverable (vollwertig) in the balance sheet of the AG Guarantor.

(iii) Any Limited Upstream Obligation granted by such AG Guarantor or by any Subsidiary of that AG
Guarantor shall be enforceable (vollstreckbar) if and to the extent such Limited Upstream Obligation is
covered (gedeckt) by a fully valuable and recoverable consideration or recourse claim (vollwertiger
_Gegenleistungs- oder Rückgewähranspruch) of the AG Guarantor against the affiliate whose_
obligations are secured by the relevant Limited Upstream Obligation and would therefore not lead to a
violation of § 57 (1) AktG (in connection with § 278 (3) AktG and/or Art. 5 SE Regulation, as
applicable), in each case unless it would lead to a violation of § 71a AktG.

(iv) Any Limited Upstream Obligation granted by such AG Guarantor or by any Subsidiary of that AG
Guarantor shall be enforceable (vollstreckbar) if and to the extent:

(A) an amount utilized under this Agreement is applied for the repayment, prepayment or other
refinancing of any financial indebtedness of such AG Guarantor or Subsidiary of such AG
Guarantor; and

(B) such exception does not lead to a violation of § 57 (1) or § 71a AktG (in connection with § 278 (3)
AktG and/or Art. 5 SE Regulation, as applicable).

(v) For the avoidance of doubt, the limits set out in this paragraph (b) shall no further apply from the date
the relevant AG Guarantor is no longer incorporated as an AG unless such Guarantor is a Subsidiary of
another AG Guarantor in which case this paragraph (b) shall apply in a way that the relevant Guarantor
shall be treated as a Subsidiary of that other AG Guarantor in accordance with this paragraph (b). In
such event, the limitations set out in this paragraph (b) shall not apply to the Limited Upstream
Obligation granted by that Guarantor in respect of any liabilities which are owed by that other AG
Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries.

(c) GmbH Guarantee Limitation Language

(i) Save as set out in this paragraph (c), the Holders and the Trustee shall not enforce, and any GmbH
Guarantor (and/or relevant subsidiary of a GmbH Guarantor) shall have a defense (Einrede) against,
any Limited Upstream Obligation if and to the extent a discharge (Erfüllung) or enforcement
(Vollstreckung) in respect of a Limited Upstream Obligation would cause a GmbH Capital Impairment
to occur.

(ii) The restrictions in paragraph (i) shall not apply:

(A) if and to the extent the Limited Upstream Obligation of the GmbH Guarantor secures any
indebtedness under any Notes Document in respect of:

(1) loans to the extent such loans are (directly or indirectly) on-lent or otherwise passed on to the
relevant GmbH Guarantor or its Subsidiaries; or

(2) bank guarantees or letters of credit that are issued for the benefit of any of the creditors of the
GmbH Guarantor or the GmbH Guarantor’s Subsidiaries,

in each case, to the extent that any such on-lending or otherwise passing on or bank guarantees or
letters of credit are still outstanding at the time of the enforcement of the relevant Limited
Upstream Obligation; for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this paragraph (ii) shall have the
effect that such on-lent amounts may be enforced multiple times (no double dip);

(B) if, at the time of enforcement of the Limited Upstream Obligation, a DPLA (either directly or
indirectly through an unbroken chain of domination and/or profit transfer agreements) exists
between the relevant Obligor whose obligations are secured by the relevant Limited Upstream
Obligation as dominating company (herrschendes Unternehmen) and the relevant GmbH
Guarantor as a dominated company (beherrschtes Unternehmen), provided that:

(1) the GmbH Guarantor is a Subsidiary of the relevant Obligor whose obligations are secured
by the relevant Limited Upstream Obligation; or

(2) the GmbH Guarantor and the relevant Obligor whose obligations are secured by the relevant
Limited Upstream Obligation are both Subsidiaries of a joint (direct or indirect) parent
company with such parent company as dominating entity (herrschendes Unternehmen),

-----

in each case unless the mere existence of such DPLA does not lead to the inapplicability of
§ 30 (1) sentence 1 GmbHG;

(C) if and to the extent any payment under the Limited Upstream Obligation is covered (gedeckt) by a
fully valuable and recoverable consideration or recourse claim (vollwertiger Gegenleistungs- oder
Rückgewähranspruch) of the GmbH Guarantor against the relevant Obligor whose obligations are
secured by the relevant Limited Upstream Obligation; or

(D) if the relevant GmbH Guarantor has not complied with its obligations pursuant to paragraphs
(iii) and/or (iv) (as applicable) below; however, if and to the extent that the relevant Limited
Upstream Obligation has been enforced without regard to the restrictions contained in this
paragraph (c) because the Management Notification and/or the Auditor’s Determination has not
(or not in a timely manner) been delivered pursuant to paragraphs (iii) and/or (iv) (as applicable)
below, but the Auditor’s Determination has then been delivered within four (4) months from its
due date in accordance with paragraphs (iv) below, the Trustee shall upon demand of the GmbH
Guarantor to the Trustee repay any amount received from the GmbH Guarantor which pursuant to
the Auditor’s Determination would not have been available for enforcement, if the Auditor’s
Determination had been delivered in a timely manner.

(iii) If the relevant GmbH Guarantor does not notify the Trustee within fifteen (15) Business Days after the
making of a demand against that German GmbH Guarantor under the relevant Limited Upstream
Obligation:

(A) to what extent such Limited Upstream Obligation is an upstream or cross-stream guarantee or
indemnity; and

(B) to what extent a GmbH Capital Impairment would occur as a result of an enforcement of the
Limited Upstream Obligation (setting out in reasonable detail the amount of its GmbH Net Assets,
providing an up-to-date pro forma balance sheet),

then the restrictions set out in paragraph (i) above shall cease to apply until a Management Notification
has been provided.

(iv) if the Trustee disagrees with the Management Notification, it may within twenty (20) Business Days of
its receipt, request the relevant GmbH Guarantor to provide to the Trustee within forty-five
(45) Business Days of receipt of such request a determination by the Auditors or any other auditors of
international standard and reputation appointed by the GmbH Guarantor (at its own cost and expense)
setting out in reasonable detail the amount in which the payment under the Limited Upstream
Obligation would cause a GmbH Capital Impairment subject to the terms set out under this paragraph
(c). Save for manifest errors, the Auditor’s Determination shall be binding on all parties.

(v) If, after it has been provided with an Auditor’s Determination which prevented it from demanding any
or only partial payment under the Limited Upstream Obligation, the Trustee ascertains in good faith
that the financial conditions of the GmbH Guarantor as set out in the Auditor’s Determination has
substantially improved, the Trustee (acting reasonably) may, at the GmbH Guarantor’s cost and
expense, arrange for the preparation of an updated balance sheet of the GmbH Guarantor by applying
the same principles that were used for the preparation of the Auditor’s Determination by the auditors
who prepared the Auditor’s Determination in order for such Auditors to determine whether (and, if so,
to what extent) the Capital Impairment has been cured as result of the improvement of the financial
condition of the GmbH Guarantor. The Trustee may not arrange for the preparation of an Auditor’s
Determination prior to the expiry of three (3) months from the date of the issuance of the preceding
Auditor’s Determination. The Trustee may only demand payment under the Limited Upstream
Obligation to the extent the Auditors determine that the Capital Impairment have been cured.

(vi) The GmbH Net Assets shall be adjusted as follows:

(A) the amount of any increase in the registered share capital of the relevant GmbH Guarantor which
was carried out after the relevant GmbH Guarantor became a party to any of the Indentures and
made from retained earnings (Kapitalerhöhung aus Gesellschaftsmitteln) shall be deducted from
the amount of the registered share capital (Stammkapital) of the relevant GmbH Guarantor if it is
expressly prohibited under the Notes Documents and has been carried out without the prior
written consent of the Agent;

(B) the amount of non-distributable assets according to § 253 (6) HGB shall not be included in the
calculation of GmbH Net Assets;

468


-----

(C) the amount of non-distributable assets according to § 268 (8) HGB shall not be included in the
calculation of GmbH Net Assets;

(D) the amount of non-distributable assets according to § 272 (5) HGB shall not be included in the
calculation of GmbH Net Assets; and

(E) loans or other liabilities incurred by the relevant GmbH Guarantor in willful or grossly negligent
violation of the Notes Documents shall not be taken into account as liabilities.

(vii) Where a GmbH Guarantor claims in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (c) that the
Guarantee can only be enforced in a limited amount, it shall realize, to the extent lawful and within
reasonable opinion commercially justifiable, any and all of its assets that are shown in the balance
sheet with a book value (Buchwert) that is significantly lower than the market value of the assets and
are not necessary for the relevant German GmbH Guarantor’s business (nicht betriebsnotwendig).

(d) Liquidity Impairment Limitation Language

(i) Save as set out in this paragraph (d), the none of the Holders and the Trustee shall enforce, and any
German Guarantor shall have a defense (Einrede) against, any Limited Upstream Obligation if and to
the extent a payment and/or enforcement in respect of a Limited Upstream Obligation would cause a
Liquidity Impairment for such German Guarantor.

(ii) Paragraphs (c)(iii), (c)(iv), (c)(v) and (c)(vii) above (including the repayment contemplated in
paragraph (c)(ii)(D) above) shall apply mutatis mutandis to the restriction in paragraph (i) above
provided that the relevant German Guarantor shall use best efforts to realize to the extent lawful any
and all of its assets that are not necessary for the relevant German GmbH Guarantor’s business (nicht
_betriebsnotwendig) (irrespective of whether it is commercially justifiable)._

(e) Where the provisions of this Section apply to a limited partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft), all references
to the assets of a German Guarantor shall mutatis mutandis include a reference to the assets of the general
partner (Komplementär) of such limited partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft).

(f) In addition to the restrictions set out in paragraphs (b) through (e) above, if a German Guarantor
demonstrates that, according to the decisions of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) or
a higher regional court of appeals (Oberlandesgericht), the payment under and/or enforcement of any
Limited Upstream Obligation against such German Guarantor would result in personal liability of its
managing director(s) (Geschäftsführer) or director(s) (Vorstände) for a reimbursement of payments made
under any Limited Upstream Obligation (including pursuant to § 43 GmbHG, § 93 AktG and/or § 826
BGB), the German Guarantor shall have a defense (Einrede) against the Limited Upstream Obligation to the
extent required in order not to incur such liability.

(g) The restrictions set out in this Section do not affect the rights of the Trustee to claim any outstanding
amount again at a later point in time if and to the extent the restrictions set out in this paragraph would allow
such claim at that later point in time.

(h) For the avoidance of doubt, the validity and enforceability of any Limited Upstream Obligation granted by a
German Guarantor or of any subsidiary of a German Guarantor in respect of any borrowing liabilities which
are owed by German Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries shall not be limited under this Section.

(i) Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the Trustee or a German Guarantor from claiming in court that
payments under Section/or an enforcement of the Limited Upstream Obligations do or do not fall within the
scope of §§ 30, 31, 43, 64 sentence 3 GmbHG, §§ 57, 71a, 92 (2), 93, 278 (3) AktG, Art. 5 SE Regulation
and/or § 826 BGB (as applicable) or that the limitations set out in this Section are not required to avoid any
violation of these laws or liability issues for any managing director or board director.

(j) Nothing in this Section shall constitute a waiver (Verzicht) of any right granted under the Indenture or any
other Notes Document to the Trustee or vice versa.

(k) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Indenture, this Section and any rights and/or obligations
arising out of it shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, German law.”

_General Comments regarding German Limitation Language_

German capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance and financial assistance rules (including with respect to
Sections 30, 31 and 64 sentence 3 GmbH and Sections 57, 71a and 92(2) sentence 3 AktG), are subject to
evolving case law. We cannot assure you that future court rulings may not further limit the access of shareholders

469


-----

to assets of its subsidiaries constituted in the form of, as applicable, an AG, a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG,
which can negatively affect the ability of the German Notes Guarantors to make payments on the Notes or the
Note Guarantees or the enforceability of the Note Guarantees, the Indentures and the Security Documents
relating to the Collateral (i.e. the share pledges and any other security interest) provided by the German Notes
Guarantors.

In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof)
regarding “destructive interference” (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation in which a shareholder
deprives a GmbH of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may be applied by courts
with respect to the enforcement of a guarantee or other collateral granted by the German Notes Guarantors. In
such a case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced, even to nil.
Moreover, according to a decision of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a security
agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about the stressed
financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant collateral by
disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply
this case law with respect to the granting of the Note Guarantees or any Collateral by the German Notes
Guarantors (including in the legal form of an AG).

Furthermore, the beneficiary (e.g., a holder of the Notes) of a transaction qualifying as a repayment of the stated
share capital of a grantor of a guarantee or security interest, as applicable, (e.g., the enforcement of such
guarantee or security interest) could moreover become personally liable under exceptional circumstances. The
German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor
were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in
violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the
beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the grantor of the guarantee or
provider of security interest is close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect
thereto.

_Parallel Debt; Security Interests_

Under German law, certain “accessory” security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) require that the pledgee
and the creditor of the secured claim be the same person. Such accessory security interests (akzessorische
_Sicherungsrechte) cannot be held on behalf of third parties who do not (yet) hold the secured claim, will_
automatically lapse to the extent a secured claims is settled, discharged or novated, and may not be assigned
independently, but will automatically follow the claims they secure in case the relevant secured claim is assigned.
The holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be party to the Security Documents. In order to
permit the holders of the Notes from time to time to benefit from pledges granted to the Security Agent under
German law, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of a “parallel debt.” Pursuant to the creation
of the parallel debt, the Security Agent has its own separate and independent claim equal to each amount payable
by each obligor under, in particular, the Notes. The pledges governed by German law will directly and
exclusively (to the extent the Notes are concerned) secure the parallel debt rather than the obligations under the
Notes or the holders of the Notes directly. The validity of the parallel debt concept and of the pledges granted
under German law to secure such parallel debt has not been tested under German law, and there is no certainty
that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability posed by German law. Therefore, the ability of the
Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted. In addition, holders of the Notes bear some risk
associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to
_Each Series of Notes,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes” and “Risk Factors—Risks_
_Relating to each Series of the Senior Notes.”_

German law does not generally permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon enforcement of
the pledge. The enforcement of a share pledge under German law usually requires the sale of the asset
constituting the collateral through a formal process involving a public auction to which certain waiting periods
and notice requirements apply. Under German law, it is unclear whether the security interest in the collateral
gives the Security Agent the right to prevent other creditors of the entities having granted such security from
foreclosing on and realizing the asset constituting the collateral. Some courts have held that certain types of
security interests only give their holders priority (according to their ranking) in the distribution of any proceeds
from the realization of the asset constituting the collateral and no right to intervene (i.e., the right to request the
court to impose a stay on proceedings initiated by other creditors).

_Hardening Periods, Fraudulent Transfer and Amendments of German Restructuring Laws by the Restructuring_
_Directive_

Under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), an insolvency administrator or in the event that debtor
in possession status has been granted, the trustee (Sachwalter) may also challenge (anfechten) transactions,
performances or other acts that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and were effected prior to the
commencement of insolvency proceedings during applicable avoidance periods. The administrator’s or the
trustee’s right to challenge transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions during the
ten year period prior to the filing of the petition for commencement of insolvency proceedings.

In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to EUR SSN Issuer, the SUN Issuer or the German Notes
Guarantors based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the payment of any amounts to the
holders of the Notes as well as the granting of collateral for or providing credit support for the benefit of the
Notes could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or, as the case may be, trustee
under the rules of avoidance as set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). In case the validity
or enforceability of the Notes or any collateral in favor of the Notes is challenged successfully, the holder of the
Notes may not be able to recover any amounts under the Notes or the relevant collateral. If payments have
already been made under the Notes or collateral, any amounts received from a transaction that had been
challenged would have to be repaid to the insolvency estate. In this case, holders of the Notes would only have a
general unsecured claim under the Notes without preference in insolvency proceedings.

In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which terms also include the provision
of security or the repayment of debt) may be avoided in the following cases.

- any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security (including a
guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (i) during the last three months
prior to the filing of a petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings, if the debtor was illiquid
(zahlungsunfähig) at the time such act was taken and the creditor knew of such illiquidity (or of
circumstances that imperatively suggest that the debtor was illiquid) at such time, or (ii) after the filing of
the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the creditor knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or the
filing of such petition (or of circumstances imperatively suggesting such illiquidity or filing); whereby in
each case an affiliated party shall be presumed to have been aware of the debtor’s insolvency or of the filing
to open insolvency proceedings;

- any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security (including a
guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) to which such creditor was not entitled or which was
granted or obtained in a form in which or at a time at which such creditor was not entitled to such security or
satisfaction, if (i) such act was taken during the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (ii) such act was taken during the second or
third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at such time or
(iii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental to
the other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that imperatively suggest such
detrimental effect); whereby in each case an affiliated party shall be presumed to have been aware of the
detrimental nature of such transaction for the other creditors;

- any transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which the debtor
loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is obtained or
becomes enforceable, provided it was entered into (i) during the three months prior to the filing of the
petition of the commencement of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid at the time of such
transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew of the illiquidity at such time or (ii) after the filing
of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings and the counterparty to such transaction
knew of either the debtor’s illiquidity or such filing at the time of the transaction; whereby in each case an
affiliated party shall be presumed to have been aware of the debtor’s illiquidity or of the filing to open
insolvency proceedings;

- any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security (including a
guarantee) for a third party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously
(unentgeltlich)), if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement
of insolvency proceedings;

- any act performed by the debtor (i) during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing with the intent to prejudice the

471


-----

insolvency creditors and the other party knew of such intention at the time of such act, with such knowledge
being presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor’s illiquidity was imminent and that the transaction
disadvantaged the other creditors (except for acts granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency
creditor, to obtain security or satisfaction to which such creditor was entitled, in which case such knowledge
(solely) being presumed if such creditor knew that the debtor was illiquid and that the transaction
disadvantaged the other creditors), (ii) except for such acts granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an
insolvency creditor, to obtain security (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) (whether or not it was
granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was entitled to such security or
satisfaction), which may only be avoided if they were effected in the four years prior to the filing of the
petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or at a time after the filing;

- any non-gratuitous contract (entgeltlicher Vertrag) concluded between the debtor and an affiliated party
(nahestehende Person) which directly operates to the detriment of the creditors can be challenged unless
such contract was concluded earlier than two years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its
creditors as of the time the contract was concluded;

- any act that provides security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for a
shareholder loan made to the debtor or an economically similar claim if (i) in the case of the provision of
security, the act took place during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of
insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition, or (ii) in the case of satisfaction, the act took
place during the last year prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after
the filing of such petition. It being understood, that the regulation for shareholder loans does not apply (i) to
shareholders which own 10% or less of the shares or interest and are not engaged in management and
(ii) until the successful restructuring of the debtor in case a creditor for the first time acquires shares during
over indebtedness, illiquidity or imminent illiquidity for the purpose of restructuring the debtor; and

- any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a
third party if (i) the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings or thereafter and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had granted
security or was liable as a guarantor or surety provider (Garant oder Bürge) (in which case the shareholder
has to compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)).

In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the
conclusion must be drawn that the debtor (e.g., a German Notes Guarantor) was unable to pay its debts generally
as they fell due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was
detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A person is deemed to have
knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if it knew of the debtor’s imminent
illiquidity and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. If the relevant act granted an insolvency
creditor, or enabled an insolvency creditor to obtain, security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction
(Befriedigung) in a form in which and at a time at which such creditor was entitled to such security or satisfaction
(kongruente Deckungshandlung), the words “imminent illiquidity” (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) in the
preceding sentence have to be replaced by “actual illiquidity” (eingetretene Zahlungsunfähigkeit). If an
insolvency creditor concluded a payment agreement (Zahlungsvereinbarung) with, or granted other forms of
deferred payment terms (Zahlungserleichterung) to, the debtor, there is a rebuttable presumption that the
insolvency creditor did not have knowledge of the illiquidity of the debtor at the time of such act. With respect to
a “related party,” there is a general presumption that such party had “knowledge.”

In relation to corporate entities, the term ‘affiliated party’ includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the
management or supervisory board, general partners and shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s
share capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to information about the
economic situation of the debtor, and other persons that are spouses, relatives or members of the household of
any of the foregoing persons.

Any amounts obtained from transactions that have been challenged would have to be repaid to the insolvency
estate.

The COVInsAG, however, provides for a privileged treatment of any kind of newly granted third-party financing
(i.e., not only traditional cash loans but also commercial credits and other forms of financing) and shareholder
loans under German insolvency law avoidance provisions. Thus, the repayment (including reasonable interest
payments) of third-party financing and shareholder loans by September 30, 2023 shall not be considered
disadvantageous to creditors if the relevant financing is granted between March 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020

472

and the debtor fulfilled the requirements for the suspension of the filing duties. This privilege also includes the
provision of collateral in favor of third-party financing providers, but does not apply in case of the provision of
collateral in favor of a shareholder loan or receivables from economically similar acts.

Furthermore, even in the absence of an insolvency proceeding, a third party creditor who has obtained an
enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) but has failed to obtain satisfaction of its enforceable claims by a levy of
execution, under certain circumstances, has the right to void certain transactions, such as the payment of debt and
the granting of security pursuant to the German Avoidance Act (Anfechtungsgesetz). The conditions for
avoidance under the German Avoidance Act differ to a certain extent from the above described rules under the
German Insolvency Code and the avoidance periods are calculated from the date when a creditor exercises its
rights of avoidance in the courts.

The German restructuring laws may be subject to further amendments in near future. On June 20, 2019, the
Directive (EU) 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on preventive
restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency
of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU)
2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency) (the “Restructuring Directive”) has been adopted. The
Restructuring Directive was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on June 26, 2019, and the
member states have approximately two years to transpose the substantive parts of the Restructuring Directive
into their national legislation, although a one year extension can be granted. The Restructuring Directive aims to
put in place key principles for all member states on effective preventive restructuring and second chance
frameworks, and measures to make all types of insolvency procedures more efficient by reducing their length and
associated costs and improving their quality. The key feature of the Restructuring Directive is the introduction of
a preventive restructuring framework. The Restructuring Directive sets out minimum EU standards to be applied
by the member states (i.e., minimum harmonization). Whereas certain features of the Restructuring Directive
need to be transposed into national legislation, the Restructuring Directive leaves a large degree of discretion
regarding the implementation of certain other features. Most notably, the Restructuring Directive provides for a
framework pursuant to which claims of the relevant creditors may be modified in a restructuring plan by majority
vote with a majority of not more than 75% of the amount of claims in each class and where applicable a majority
by numbers and against the voting of a single creditor in a pre-insolvency restructuring procedure, i.e. outside
formal insolvency proceedings. The Restructuring Directive also provides for cross class cram down, i.e. even if
the creditors of one class voting on the restructuring plan did not consent to the restructuring plan with the
required majority, the restructuring plan might still be adopted and take effect for the dissenting creditors.
Further, the Restructuring Directive provides for a stay on enforcement, which needs to be transposed into
national legislation. The implementation of the Restructuring Directive into national legislation might also
include priority ranking for new financing.

_Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims_

The insolvency estate shall serve to satisfy the liquidated claims held by the personal creditors against the debtor
on the date when the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims shall be satisfied ranking below
the other claims of insolvency creditors in the order given below, and according to the proportion of their
amounts if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the claims of the insolvency
creditors from the day of the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by individual insolvency
creditors due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and
administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal consequences of a criminal or administrative offence binding
the debtor to pay money; (iv) claims to the debtor’s gratuitous performance of a consideration; and (v) claims for
restitution of a shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims resulting from legal transactions
corresponding in economic terms to such a loan. The CovInsAG, however, suspends the statutory subordination
of shareholder loans and receivables from economically similar acts in insolvency proceedings applied for up
until September 30, 2023 for newly granted shareholder loans granted between March 1, 2020 and September 30,
2020 and where the debtor fulfilled the requirements for the suspension of the filing duties.

Under federal Canadian corporate law, there are no financial assistance rules that would restrict the giving of
upstream guarantees by corporations or limited partnerships. Under Ontario law (and the federal laws of Canada
applicable therein), a guarantee or some of its provisions may be unenforceable against the guarantor if they
constitute (i) a penalty or (ii) a breach of statute or public policy (e.g., a clause providing for a rate of interest
exceeding the statutory ceiling under the Canadian Criminal Code would be illegal). A guarantee may also be
unenforceable if the underlying guaranteed obligation has been changed without the consent of the principal
debtor or is unenforceable against the principal debtor. The latter result may be avoided if the guarantee also
includes appropriate language that causes it to be properly characterized as an indemnity in that an indemnity
remains enforceable notwithstanding any invalidity or defect in the underlying obligation unless it would be
contrary to public policy to provide indemnification for the underlying obligation.

However, there can be no assurance that an agreement characterized by the parties as an indemnity will not be
recharacterized as a guarantee by the court. While a guarantee may also provide that a guarantor will be liable as
principal debtor for any amount not recoverable on the basis of a guarantee, the enforceability or effect of such a
clause is questionable and in certain circumstances such a clause may provide the guarantor with an additional
defense to enforcement. Guarantees typically contain waivers of defenses available to the guarantor as a matter
of law. Broad, non-specific waivers of any defenses that may be available to guarantors may be unenforceable if
the court finds that they are too vague or uncertain. The giving of a guarantee by a federal Canadian corporation
may also be subject to an oppression claim at corporate law.

**_Preferences and Transfers at Undervalue_**

In the context of certain proceedings, a trustee in bankruptcy, monitor or proposal trustee is required to review
asset transfers and transactions undertaken by the bankrupt or insolvent debtor within specified time periods prior
to the commencement of insolvency proceedings to determine if the debtor was engaged in any preferential
transactions or transfers at undervalue. In the case of “transfers at under value,” the review period is one year (or
five years for parties not dealing at arm’s length) and preferences are subject to review if they occurred within
three months (or twelve months for parties not dealing at arm’s length).

A Note Guarantee could be voided as a preference or transfer at undervalue if (1) the applicable Guarantor issued
the applicable Note Guarantee with the intent of defeating, delaying or defrauding creditors or with a view to
giving the creditor a preference, or (2) the Guarantor was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the
issuance of the applicable Note Guarantee, and (3) in the case of a transfer at undervalue only, the applicable
Guarantor did not receive any consideration for issuing the applicable Note Guarantee or if the consideration
received by the issuer of the Note Guarantee was conspicuously less than the fair market value of the
consideration given by the applicable Guarantor.

If a court were to find that the issuance of a Note Guarantee was a preference or transfer at undervalue, the court
could void the payment obligations under such Note Guarantee or subordinate such Note Guarantee to presently
existing and future indebtedness of the applicable Guarantor, or require the holders of the Notes to repay any
amounts received with respect to such Note Guarantee. In the event of a finding that a preference or transfer at
undervalue occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the Notes.

We cannot be certain that the issuance of the Note Guarantees would not be subordinated to any of the
Guarantors’ other debt or determined by a court to be void.

**_Insolvency_**

In Canada, insolvency proceedings are governed principally by two federal statutes (with a third applying mainly
to federal financial institutions). The federal insolvency laws in Canada apply across the country and allow for
either a liquidation type proceeding (i.e., a chapter 7 type liquidation) or a restructuring type proceeding (i.e., a
chapter 11 type proceeding). In addition, under federal insolvency laws, secured creditors may appoint what is
known as a “receiver” over the collateral of the debtor, in order to sell the debtor’s assets or manage the debtor’s
business or otherwise realize on collateral. In addition, secured creditors may have recourse to self-help or court
supervised proceedings. Notwithstanding that insolvency proceedings in Canada are governed by federal statute,
in certain circumstances provincial and territorial laws will affect the conduct and/or outcome of those
proceedings (e.g., security laws, landlord rights, etc.).

The rights of the Trustee who represents the holders of the Notes to enforce remedies could be delayed by the
restructuring provisions of applicable Canadian federal bankruptcy, insolvency and other restructuring legislation
if the benefit of such legislation is sought with respect to any Guarantors with sufficient nexus to Canada. The

474


-----

powers of the court under the federal insolvency statutes have been interpreted and exercised broadly so as to
protect a restructuring entity from actions taken by creditors and other parties. Accordingly, we cannot predict
whether payments under the Notes or the Note Guarantees would be made during any bankruptcy, insolvency or
other restructuring proceedings, whether or when the Trustee could exercise its rights under the Note Guarantees
or whether and to what extent holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delays in payment, if any, of
principal, interest and costs, including the fees and disbursements of the Trustee.

**_Liquidation_**

Bankruptcy proceedings in Canada can be either voluntarily commenced by a debtor or commenced involuntarily
against the debtor by any creditor of such debtor with an unsecured claim of C$1,000 or more. In order for an
involuntary bankruptcy filing to be valid, the debtor must have committed one of the acts of bankruptcy set out in
the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (the “BIA”), with the most common act of bankruptcy being the inability or
failure to meet obligations generally as they become due. Upon a bankruptcy occurring, all of the assets of the
bankrupt vest in a trustee in bankruptcy, with the proceedings being subject to the oversight of both the
Superintendent of Bankruptcy and the relevant court. Typically, a trustee in bankruptcy proceeds to liquidate the
assets of the bankrupt and distribute the proceeds to creditors in accordance with their legal priorities.

The BIA and certain other federal and provincial statutes in Canada provide super priority status to claims such
as payroll deductions for employee income taxes, government operated pension plans and employment insurance,
as well as for certain specified private pension contributions (if any), unpaid wages and employee disbursements
(accrued in the six months prior to the bankruptcy, up to C$2,000 for wages and C$1,000 for disbursements, per
employee) and, in some circumstances, collected and unremitted Goods and Services Tax and Harmonized Sales
Tax. After the statutory super priority claims are paid, the BIA provides that secured creditors are to be paid prior
to unsecured creditors. While the general rule is that unsecured creditors share any remaining proceeds pari
passu, the BIA does provide that certain “preferred” claims are to be paid prior to the general body of unsecured
creditors, including the fees and expenses of the trustee and its counsel, remaining unpaid wages accrued in the
six months prior to the bankruptcy beyond the priority amounts noted above and certain landlord claims.

Upon the occurrence of a bankruptcy order or a voluntary assignment in bankruptcy, the BIA imposes a stay of
proceedings and leave is required to proceed, or continue, with any actions against the bankrupt entity. The stay
of proceedings does not apply to secured creditors. Secured creditors are free to continue to enforce their security
against the assets of the bankrupt, subject to satisfying the trustee that they have valid and perfected security over
the same.

As stated above, a secured creditor may appoint a “receiver” or “receiver-manager” over the assets of a debtor.
The receiver is not typically appointed to restructure a business. A receivership is intended as a mechanism for
realizing on collateral through a liquidation or a going-concern sale. The receiver will proceed to sell the debtor’s
assets, manage the debtor’s business or otherwise realize on the collateral, with the proceeds from its activities
payable in accordance with the established priorities. A receiver can be court-appointed or privately appointed—
the advantages and disadvantages of each vary. In the case of a court-appointed receivership, the powers of the
receiver are in the discretion of the court. The appointment order typically includes a stay of proceedings and
priority charges for the receiver’s fees and costs. In the case of a private receiver, the receiver’s powers are
prescribed by contract (i.e., between the creditor and the debtor). In each case, the receivership remains subject to
many of the considerations in a bankruptcy, including super-priorities, reporting obligations, etc. although certain
priorities will be different where no bankruptcy is involved. A receiver is often appointed where only the secured
creditors are likely to be paid out of the realizations or there is an opportunity to realize higher returns through a
going-concern sale of the business than a piecemeal liquidation. Ultimately, however, the effect is the same: the
realization on the debtor’s assets in favor of those creditors legally entitled to the proceeds.

**_Restructuring_**

Generally, restructuring proceedings are commenced under one of two statutes in Canada. For large or complex
restructurings, the most commonly used statute is the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (the “CCAA”). In
order to seek relief under the CCAA, the debtor must have at least C$5 million in outstanding claims against it.
The granting of an order for relief under the CCAA is in the discretion of the court, but if granted, a CCAA order
typically involves a broad stay of proceedings (applying to secured and unsecured creditors), protection from the
termination of contracts by third parties, authority to disclaim or repudiate unfavorable contracts and, in certain
cases, the granting of super-priority security interests or charges on the assets of the applicant debtor company to
secure amounts owing to debtor-in-possession lenders, professionals involved in the restructuring, directors of
the company with respect to their statutory liabilities and sometimes others. An initial stay of proceedings under

475


-----

the CCAA cannot exceed 10 days, but the applicant debtor company is entitled to seek extensions to the stay.
There is no time limit on the duration of an extension to the stay of proceedings under the CCAA or on the
duration of the entirety of the proceeding itself.

CCAA proceedings are supervised by the court and upon the making of an order under the CCAA, the court must
appoint a licensed trustee in bankruptcy to act as the “monitor” of the applicant company. The monitor is given
certain powers under the CCAA and additional powers may be granted by court order. The monitor does not take
possession of, or have any control over, the assets of the applicant company unless otherwise ordered by the
court. The monitor is required to oversee certain filings made by the applicant company and provide its views
with respect to same. The monitor also has a statutory duty to advise the court of any material adverse change in
the status of the applicant company.

Under the CCAA, a company may, inter alia, proceed to file a plan of compromise or arrangement, or seek court
approval of a sale of some or all of its assets. In the case of a plan of compromise or arrangement, it is necessary
for the applicant company to obtain the requisite level of creditor approval (66 [2]⁄3% in value of the debt and more
than 50% in number of the creditors who cast votes in each affected class of creditors) and court approval of the
restructuring plan. Secured creditors may be included in the plan, in which case they are generally not included in
the same class as unsecured creditors, or may be dealt with outside of the plan. Upon requisite creditor and court
approvals being obtained, the restructuring plan is binding on all affected creditors whether or not they voted in
favor of the plan. CCAA plans may be combined with plans of reorganization or arrangement under Canada’s
federal and provincial corporate statutes, allowing Canadian corporate entities to change their share capital,
including cancelling existing shares and/or converting existing debt to new shares, in the context of a plan. If the
proceeding includes an asset sale, any sale out of the ordinary course is subject to approval of the court (but with
no creditor vote) and the court is authorized to make an order transferring assets to a purchaser free and clear of
all liens, claims and encumbrances. During the course of a CCAA proceeding, creditors and contractual counter
parties are not entitled to exercise any rights or remedies without leave of the court except for certain statutory
exceptions (e.g., proven claims of set-off, termination and enforcement rights under certain types of derivative
agreements and certain regulatory investigations).

The court may not approve an asset sale or sanction a restructuring plan in the context of a CCAA proceeding
unless any existing super priority employee wage claims and pension contribution claims are satisfied or
provided for to the satisfaction of the court.

Debtors in Canada may also proceed with a restructuring under the proposal provisions of the Bankruptcy and
Insolvency Act (as previously defined, the “BIA”). The proposal provisions of the BIA (the “Proposal
Provisions”) provide for a process that is generally similar to, but less flexible than, restructuring proceedings
under the CCAA. A restructuring under the BIA is typically undertaken where the proposed restructuring is small
or relatively simple; or, where the applicant debtor simply does not qualify for the CCAA because its aggregate
debt is less than C$5 million. There is no minimum amount of outstanding debt required to use the Proposal
Provisions.

Upon filing a proposal (or a notice of intention to make a proposal) with the Office of the Superintendent of
Bankruptcy, the BIA provides an automatic stay of proceedings. There is no need to apply to the court for the
initial stay. The nature and term of the stay varies, depending on whether the debtor commences the proceedings
by filing a proposal or by filing a notice of intention to make a proposal. In the context of a proposal, the stay
applies to unsecured creditors but will only apply to secured creditors if the proposal includes an offer to secured
creditors. Such stay will remain in place until the trustee administering the proposal proceedings is discharged
(e.g., the proposal is implemented and the proceedings concluded) or the debtor becomes bankrupt (e.g., via a
failed proposal, as discussed below). In the context of a notice of intention to make a proposal, the initial stay is
for a period of 30 days, which applies to secured and unsecured creditors. However, if the debtor has not
completed its proposal within the initial 30-day period, it may apply to the court for an extension of such period.
The Proposal Provisions limit the duration of initial 30-day period and any extensions thereto, to an aggregate of
six months from the date of the filing of the notice of intention. Failure to file a proposal within this period will
result in a deemed bankruptcy. In the case of any proceedings under the Proposal Provisions, the applicant debtor
is protected from the termination of most contracts by third parties.

The Proposal Provisions allow for the granting of super priority charges (similar to the CCAA), repudiation or
disclaimer of contracts (similar to the CCAA), and the appointment of a proposal trustee (which may have a
similar role and powers as a monitor under the CCAA). A proposal is ultimately put to a creditor vote, with
secured creditors (if any) voting in a separate class (or classes). In the event that the debtor’s proposal to its
creditors is either rejected by any class of unsecured creditors at a meeting held to approve such proposal (same
voting thresholds as the CCAA noted above) or by the court when the proposal is put before the court for

476


-----

approval, the debtor is deemed bankrupt. Notably, if a proposal is rejected by a class of secured creditors but
accepted by each class of unsecured creditors, the proposal does not automatically fail. The secured class
rejecting the proposal is left to pursue private remedies, while the proposal is submitted to the court for approval.

The court may not approve an asset sale in the context of proposal proceedings or sanction a proposal unless any
existing super priority employee wage claims and pension contribution claims are satisfied or provided for to the
satisfaction of the court.

In the event of a foreign insolvency proceeding, both the CCAA and the BIA allow a representative, authorized
in a foreign proceeding in respect of a debtor, to seek recognition of the foreign insolvency proceeding in
Canada. The CCAA and the BIA each provide for a modified version of the UNCITRAL model insolvency law
(collectively, the “Recognition Provisions”). The Recognition Provisions allow an authorized representative to
apply for recognition of the foreign insolvency proceeding as either a “foreign main proceeding” or a “foreign
non-main proceeding.” The determination of the type of proceeding is based upon the centre of main interest
(“COMI”) of the debtor. If the court determines that the foreign proceeding is a “foreign main proceeding,” the
court must grant a stay of proceedings in Canada and may grant additional relief permitted under the CCAA/
BIA. If the court determines that the foreign proceeding is a “foreign non-main” proceeding, the court may, but is
not required to, grant a stay of proceedings in Canada and any other relief permitted under the CCAA/BIA. In the
event of a recognition order being granted, certain restrictions are imposed on the debtor, including a restriction
on selling assets in Canada unless the court approves such asset sale transaction. In the event that the foreign
proceeding results in the approval of a restructuring plan, the Canadian court may grant an order providing that
such plan shall have full force and recognition in Canada.

**The Netherlands**

**_Dutch Insolvency Law_**

Two Post-Closing Guarantors are incorporated in the Netherlands. Any insolvency proceeding concerning the
Post-Closing Guarantors would likely be based on Dutch insolvency law under the EU Insolvency Regulation.
Under certain circumstances, bankruptcy proceedings may also be opened in the Netherlands in accordance with
Dutch law over the assets of companies that are not incorporated under Dutch law.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Dutch insolvency law. There are two primary insolvency
regimes under Dutch law: the first, moratorium of payments (surseance van betaling), is intended to facilitate the
reorganization of a debtor’s indebtedness and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern. The second,
bankruptcy (faillissement), is primarily designed to liquidate assets and distribute the proceeds of the assets of a
debtor to its creditors. Both insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet). In
practice, a suspension of payments often results in bankruptcy. A general description of the principles of both
insolvency regimes is set out below.

_Suspension of Payments_

An application for a moratorium of payments can only be made by the debtor itself, if it foresees that it will be
unable to continue to pay its payable debts. Once the request for a moratorium of payments is filed, a court will
immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional moratorium and appoint an administrator (bewindvoerder). A meeting
of creditors is required to decide on the definitive moratorium. If a draft composition (ontwerpakkoord) is filed
simultaneously with the application for a moratorium of payments, the court can order that the composition will
be processed before a decision about a definitive moratorium.

If the composition is accepted and subsequently ratified by the court (gehomologeerd), the provisional
moratorium ends. The definitive moratorium will generally be granted unless a qualified minority (more than one
quarter of the amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more than one third of
the number of creditors represented at such creditors’ meeting) of the unsecured non-preferential creditors
withholds its consent. The granting of a definitive moratorium can also be withheld if there is a valid fear that the
debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a moratorium of payments or if there is no prospect that the
debtor will be able to satisfy its creditors in the (near) future.

The moratorium of payments is only effective with regard to unsecured non-preferential creditors. Unlike
Chapter 11 proceedings under U.S. bankruptcy law, during which both secured and unsecured creditors are
generally barred from seeking to recover on their claims during a moratorium of payments, under Dutch law
secured and preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities) may enforce their rights against
assets of the company in moratorium of payments to satisfy their claims as if there were no moratorium of
payments. A recovery under Dutch law could, therefore, involve a sale of assets that does not reflect the going

477


-----

concern value of the debtor. However, at the request of an interested party the court can order a “cooling down
period” (afkoelingsperiode) for a maximum period of two months (which can be extended by the court once for
another period of two months) during which enforcement actions by secured or preferential creditors are barred.
Also in a definitive moratorium of payments, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors. A
composition will be binding for all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is approved by (i) a simple
majority of the number of creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of
the claims that are acknowledged and admitted in the moratorium, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd)
by the court. Consequently, Dutch insolvency law could preclude or inhibit the ability of the noteholders to effect
a restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a holder of Notes in a Dutch moratorium of payments
proceeding. Interest payments that fall due after the date on which a moratorium of payments is granted, cannot
be claimed in a composition.

_Bankruptcy_

Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it has ceased to pay its debts. The bankruptcy can be
requested by a creditor of a claim when there is at least one other creditor. At least one of the aforementioned
claims (of the bankruptcy requesting creditor or the other creditor) needs to be due and payable. The debtor can
also request the application of bankruptcy proceedings itself.

During a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding, the assets of a debtor are generally liquidated and the proceeds
distributed to the debtor’s creditors in accordance with the respective rank and priority of their claims. The
general principle of Dutch insolvency law is the paritas creditorum (principle of equal treatment), which means
that all creditors have an equal right to payment and that the proceeds of bankruptcy proceedings shall be
distributed in proportion to the size of their respective claims. However, certain creditors (such as secured
creditors and tax and social security authorities) will have special rights that take priority over the rights of other
creditors. Consequently, Dutch insolvency laws could reduce your potential recovery in a Dutch bankruptcy
proceeding.

The claim of a creditor may be limited depending on the date the claim becomes due and payable in accordance
with its terms. Generally, claims of the noteholders that were not due and payable by their terms on the date of a
bankruptcy of the relevant Dutch Guarantor will be accelerated and become due and payable as of that date. Each
of these claims will have to be submitted to the bankruptcy receiver (curator) to be verified. “Verification” under
Dutch law means that the receiver determines the value of the claim and whether and to what extent it will be
admitted in the bankruptcy of the company for the purpose of the distribution of the proceeds. The valuation of
claims that otherwise would not have been payable at the time of the bankruptcy proceeding may be based on a
net present value analysis. Interest payments that fall due after the date of the bankruptcy cannot be verified. The
existence, value and ranking of any claims submitted by the noteholders may be challenged in the Dutch
bankruptcy proceeding. Generally, in a creditors’ meeting (verificatievergadering), the bankruptcy receiver, the
insolvent debtor and all verified creditors may dispute the verification of claims of other creditors. Creditors
whose claims or value thereof are disputed in the creditors’ meeting may be referred to separate court
proceedings (renvooiprocedure). These procedures could cause noteholders to recover less than the principal
amount of their Notes or less than they could recover in a U.S. liquidation proceeding. Such renvooi proceedings
could also cause payments to the noteholders to be delayed compared with holders of undisputed claims. As in
moratorium of payments proceedings, in the bankruptcy of a company a composition may be offered to creditors,
which shall be binding on unsecured non-preferential creditors if it is approved by (i) a simple majority in
number of the creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims
that are acknowledged and conditionally admitted, and (ii) subsequently confirmed by the court. The Dutch
Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet) does not in itself acknowledge the concept of classes of creditors. Remaining
proceeds, if any, after satisfaction of the secured and the preferential creditors are distributed among the
unsecured non-preferential creditors, who will be satisfied on a pro rata basis. Contractual subordination may to a
certain extent be given effect in Dutch insolvency proceedings. The actual effect depends largely on the way such
subordination is construed.

Secured creditors may enforce their rights against assets of the debtor to satisfy their claims under a Dutch
bankruptcy as if there is no bankruptcy. As in moratorium of payments proceedings the supervisory judge
(rechtercommissaris) can order a “cooling down period” for a maximum of two months (which can be extended
once for another period of two months) during which enforcement actions by secured creditors are barred unless
such creditors have obtained leave for enforcement from the supervisory judge. Furthermore, a bankruptcy
receiver can force a secured creditor to enforce its security interest within a reasonable period of time, failing
which the receiver will be entitled to sell the secured assets, if any, and the secured creditor will have to share in
the general costs of the bankruptcy, which can be significant. Excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned

478

to the bankruptcy estate; they may not be set off against an unsecured claim of the secured creditor in the
bankruptcy. An exception applies in the case of set off relating to a payment to the pledger, not made during its
bankruptcy and if there are no other pledgees or other holders of limited rights other than the pledgee, although a
set off prior to bankruptcy may be subject to clawback in the case of fraudulent conveyance or bad faith in
obtaining the claim used for set off. Moreover, to the extent that Dutch law applies, a legal act performed by a
debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the
obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a third party’s obligations,
enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having a similar effect)
can be challenged in an insolvency proceeding or otherwise and may be nullified by any of its creditors or its
trustee in bankruptcy. See below “—Fraudulent Transfer.”

Under Dutch law, as soon as a debtor is declared bankrupt, in principle, all pending executions of judgments
against such debtor, as well as all attachments on the debtor’s assets (other than with respect to secured creditors
and certain other creditors, as described above), will be terminated by operation of law. Simultaneously with the
opening of the bankruptcy, a bankruptcy receiver will be appointed. The proceeds resulting from the liquidation
of the bankruptcy estate may not be sufficient to satisfy unsecured creditors under the guarantees granted by an
insolvent guarantor after the secured and the preferential creditors have been satisfied. In principle, litigation
pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically stayed.

**_Limitations on Enforcement_**

If a Dutch private limited liability company or public limited liability company grants a guarantee or security
interest and that guarantee or security interest is not in the company’s corporate interest, the guarantee or security
interest may be nullified by the relevant Dutch company, its bankruptcy receiver (curator) in bankruptcy
(faillissement) and its administrator (bewindvoerder) in moratorium of payment proceedings (surseance van
_betaling) or otherwise and, as a consequence, not be valid, binding and enforceable against it. In determining_
whether the granting of a guarantee or security interest is in the interest of a Dutch company, Dutch courts would
not only consider the text of the objects clause in the articles of association (statuten) of the company but all
relevant circumstances, including (i) whether the company irrespective of the wording of the objects clause
derives certain commercial benefits from the transaction in respect of which the guarantee or security interest
was granted and (ii) the balance between the risk that the company is assuming and the benefit it derives from
such transaction. In addition, if it is determined that there are no, or insufficient, commercial benefits from the
transactions for the company that grants the guarantee, then such company (and any bankruptcy receiver) may
challenge the enforcement of the guarantee or security interest, and it is possible that such challenge would be
successful. Such benefit may, according to Dutch case law, consist of an indirect benefit derived by the company
as a consequence of the interdependence of such company with the group of companies to which it belongs. In
addition, it is relevant whether, as a consequence of the granting of the guarantee or security interest, the
continuity of such company would foreseeably be endangered by the granting of such guarantee or security
interest. It remains possible that even if such strong financial and commercial interdependence exists, the
transaction may be declared void if it appears that the granting of the guarantee or security interest cannot serve
the realization of the relevant company’s objects or where it is determined that there is a material imbalance to
the disadvantage of the company between the commercial benefit on the one hand and the risks on the other
hand. The above also applies with respect to any security interest granted or other legal act entered into by a
Dutch company.

If Dutch law applies, a guarantee or security governed by Dutch law may be voided by a court, if the document
was executed through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress (bedreiging) or
mistake (dwaling) of a party to the agreement contained in that document. Payment pursuant to a guarantee or
following enforcement or foreclosure of security granted may, regardless of an insolvency situation occurring or
not, also be withheld due to unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene omstandigheden), force majeure (niet
_toerekenbare tekortkoming) or reasonableness and fairness (redelijkheid en billijkheid). Other impeding factors_
include dissolution (ontbinding) of contract and set off (verrekening).

In addition, a guarantee issued by a Dutch company and a security interest provided by a Dutch company may be
suspended (schorsen) by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam (Ondernemingskamer
_van het Gerechtshof te Amsterdam) on the motion of the holder or holders of 10% or more of the shares in such_
company, as well as on the motion of a trade union and of other entities entitled thereto in the articles of
association of the relevant Dutch company. Likewise, the guarantee or security itself may be upheld by the
Enterprise Chamber, yet actual payment under it may be suspended or avoided.

According to Dutch case law, a director (bestuurder) of a company acts wrongfully against a creditor of the
company if he has entered into commitments on behalf of that company, while he knew or reasonably ought to

479


-----

understand that the company would not, or not within a reasonable period of time, be able to meet its obligations
and would not provide sufficient opportunity for recourse for the detriment that the creditor would suffer on the
basis thereof. The foregoing is subject to any circumstances raised by the director on the basis of which the
conclusion is justified that he personally cannot be blamed sufficiently (voldoende ernstig verwijt) for the
detriment suffered.

**_Fraudulent Transfer_**

To the extent that Dutch law applies, a guarantee or security interest granted by a legal entity may, under certain
circumstances, be nullified by any of its creditors, if (i) the guarantee or security interest was granted without
prior existing legal obligation to do so (onverplicht), (ii) the creditor(s) concerned was/were prejudiced as a
consequence of the guarantee or the granting of the security interest and (iii) at the time the guarantee or security
interest was granted both the legal entity and, unless the guarantee or security interest was granted for no
consideration (om niet), the beneficiary of the guarantee or security interest knew or should have known that one
or more of the entities’ creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced (actio pauliana). Also to the extent that
Dutch insolvency law applies, a guarantee or security interest may be nullified by the bankruptcy receiver
(curator) on behalf of and for the benefit of all creditors of the insolvent debtor, and in such case the beneficiary
of the guarantee or security interest is presumed (subject to evidence to the contrary) to have known that creditors
of the debtor would be prejudiced if the bankruptcy follows within a year of the granting and for no
consideration. The foregoing requirements for invoking fraudulent transfer outside of a bankruptcy apply mutatis
_mutandis when invoking fraudulent transfer provisions during a bankruptcy. In addition, the bankruptcy receiver_
may challenge the guarantee or security interest if it was granted on the basis of a prior existing legal obligation
to do so (verplichte rechtshandeling), if (i) the guarantee or security interest was granted at a time that the
beneficiary of such guarantee or security interest knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed or (ii) if such
guarantee or security interest was granted as a result of deliberation between the debtor and the beneficiary of
such guarantee or security interest with a view to give preference to the beneficiary over the debtor’s other
creditors. Consequently, the validity of any guarantees or security interests granted by a Dutch legal entity may
be challenged and it is possible that such challenge would be successful.

It is not certain and has not been determined in published case law whether a right of pledge on shares can be
created in advance of the acquisition of the shares by the pledger. If a security right is created on collateral to
which a Dutch company has not yet obtained a legally valid title, such collateral will not be subject to such a
security interest if that company is declared bankrupt or granted a moratorium of payments prior to obtaining title
thereto.

It is not possible to conduct searches in respect of any Dutch law governed security (other than, if created, in
respect of rights of mortgage), with the exception of any pledge created on the shares in a Dutch private limited
liability company which should be registered in its shareholders’ register. However, this does not constitute
conclusive evidence of the absence of any preexisting security.

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

_You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of any of the_
_Notes offered hereby._

The Notes and the Note Guarantees (together, the “Securities”) have not been, and will not be, registered under
the Securities Act, or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and, unless so registered, may not be offered or
sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the
Securities Act and the securities laws of any other applicable jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Securities offered
hereby are being offered and sold only to qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A under the
Securities Act) in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act and in offshore transactions to non-U.S.
persons outside of the United States (in each case, as defined in Regulation S) in reliance on Regulation S under
the Securities Act.

We use the terms “offshore transaction,” “U.S. person” and the “United States” with the meanings given to them
in Regulation S.

Each purchaser of the Securities (other than the Initial Purchasers), by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to
have acknowledged, represented to, warranted to and agreed with the Issuers, each Guarantor and the Initial
Purchasers as follows:

(1) The purchaser understands and acknowledges that the Securities have not been registered under the

to qualified institutional buyers, one year after the later of the original issue date of such Securities, the
original issue date of the issuance of any additional securities and the last date on which the relevant Issuer
or any affiliate of the Issuers was the owner of such Security (or any predecessor of such Security) and, in

Security) was first offered to persons other than distributors (as defined in Rule 902 of Regulation S) in
reliance on Regulation S only (i) to the Issuers, the Guarantors or any subsidiary thereof, (ii) pursuant to a

subsequent to the Resale Restriction Termination Date;

(6) Each purchaser acknowledges that each Note will contain a legend substantially to the following effect:

If the purchaser purchases Securities, it will also be deemed to acknowledge that the foregoing restrictions
apply to holders of beneficial interests in these Securities as well as to holders of these Securities.

(7) The purchaser agrees that it will give to each person to whom it transfers the Securities notice of any
restrictions on the transfer of such Securities;

Securities acquired by it except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to the Issuers and the Registrar
that the restrictions set forth therein have been complied with;

accuracy of its acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements and agrees that if any of the
acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements deemed to have been made by its purchase
of the Securities is no longer accurate, it shall promptly notify the Initial Purchasers. If it is acquiring any
Securities as a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, it represents that it has sole investment
discretion with respect to each such investor account and that it has full power to make the foregoing

(11) The purchaser represents and warrants that either (i) it is not a Plan and no portion of the assets it used to
acquire or hold the Notes (or any interest therein) constitutes assets of any Plan, or (ii) its acquisition and
holding of the Notes does not and will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406
of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation under any applicable Similar Law.

agent for one or more investor accounts, the purchaser represents that it has sole investment discretion with
respect to each such investor account and that it has full power to make the foregoing acknowledgements,
representations and agreements on behalf of each such investor account.

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase and holding of the Notes by
(i) employee benefit plans (as defined in section 3(3) of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended (“ERISA”)) that are subject to Title I of ERISA; (ii) plans, individual retirement accounts and
other arrangements (as described in Section 4975 of the Code) that are subject to Section 4975 of the Code;
(iii) entities and accounts whose underlying assets are considered to include “plan assets” (within the meaning of
regulations issued by the United States Department of Labor, set forth in 29 C.F.R. §2510.3-101, as modified by
section 3(42) of ERISA (the “Plan Asset Regulations”)) of such plans, accounts and arrangements (the “Plan
Assets”); and (iv) plans, accounts or other arrangements that are subject to provisions under any federal, state,
local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations that are similar to such provisions of the Code or ERISA
(collectively, “Similar Laws”) (each, a “Plan”).

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA imposes certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I of ERISA, and ERISA
and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of a Plan subject to Title I of
ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code (an “ERISA Plan”) and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under
ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of
an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment
advice for a fee or other compensation to an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of such
ERISA Plan.

When considering an investment in the Notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should determine
whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the
applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Laws relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan,
including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction
provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws. No representation is made that the sale of
any Notes to a Plan meets the fiduciary requirements for investments by Plans generally or any particular Plan or
that such an investment is appropriate for Plans generally or any particular Plan. None of the Issuers, the
Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers nor any of the parties described in this offering memorandum, or their
respective affiliates, is providing any advice or recommendation to any Plan, including, without limitation, in a
fiduciary capacity, through this offering memorandum or otherwise, in connection with the sale of the Notes. The
decision to purchase and hold the Notes must be made solely by each prospective Plan purchaser on an arm’s
length basis.

**Prohibited Transaction Issues**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified
transactions involving Plan Assets with persons or entities, including fiduciaries, who are “parties in interest,”
within the meaning of ERISA, or “disqualified persons” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless
an exemption is available.

A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to
excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. Plans that are not subject to the
requirements of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code may be subject to similar provisions under
applicable Similar Laws.

The acquisition and/or holding of Notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which the Issuers, the Guarantors or
the Initial Purchasers are considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct
or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the
investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited
transaction exemption. In this regard, the Department of Labor (the “DOL”) has issued prohibited transaction
class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the Notes. These class exemptions
include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified
professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38
respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting insurance company general accounts and
PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. Further, Section 408(b)(17) of
ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code may also provide exemptive relief; provided that neither the Issuers
nor the any of their affiliates has or exercises any discretionary authority or control or renders any investment
advice with respect to the assets of any ERISA Plan involved in the acquisition or holding of the Notes

484

and; provided further that the ERISA Plan receives no less, and pays no more, than “adequate compensation”
(within the meaning of Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(f)(10) of the Code) in connection with
such acquisition and holding. Under the Plan Asset Regulations, the assets of the Issuers would be treated as Plan
Assets of an ERISA Plan if the ERISA Plan acquires an equity interest in the Issuers and none of the exceptions
contained in the Plan Asset Regulations is applicable. If the underlying assets of the Issuers are deemed to be
Plan Assets, the obligations and other responsibilities of sponsors, fiduciaries and plan administrators of the
ERISA Plans, and of parties in interest and disqualified persons (as defined under ERISA and the Code), under
Parts 1 and 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, as applicable, may be expanded,
and there may be an increase in their liability under these and other provisions of ERISA and the Code (except to
the extent (if any) that a favorable statutory or administrative exemption or exception applies). An “equity
interest” is defined under the Plan Asset Regulations as an interest in an entity other than an instrument which is
treated as indebtedness under applicable local law and which has no substantial equity features. Although there is
little guidance on the subject and no assurance can be given, at the time of their issuance, the Notes may not be
treated as equity interests of the Issuers for purposes of the Plan Asset Regulation. That determination is based, in
part, upon the traditional debt features of the Notes, including the reasonable expectation of purchasers of such
Notes that such Notes will be repaid when due, as well as the absence of conversion rights, warrants and other
typical equity features.

The Notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing the assets of any Plan, unless such purchase
and holding will be exempt from the prohibited transaction restrictions contained in or would not result in a
violation of any applicable Similar Laws.

By acceptance of a Note or any interest therein, each Purchaser and transferee of Notes (or any interest therein)
will be deemed to have represented, warranted and agreed, among other things, that either (a) it is not, and for so
long as it holds any Notes (or interest therein) it will not be, a Plan and no portion of the assets used by such
Purchaser or transferee to acquire and hold the Notes or an interest therein constitutes assets of any Plan; or
(b) the purchase and holding of the Notes or an interest therein by such Purchaser or transferee does not and will
not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code or a violation of any applicable Similar Laws. The purchaser of Notes (or any interest therein) will be
deemed to have represented, warranted and agreed, among other things, that the purchaser will not transfer the
Notes to any person or entity, unless such person or entity is deemed to and could itself truthfully make the
foregoing representations and covenants.

**The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive. Due to the complexity**
**of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited**
**transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering purchasing the**
**Notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential**
**applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an**
**exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the Notes. Purchasers and transferees of the**
**Notes have exclusive responsibility for ensuring that their purchase and holding of the Notes does not**
**violate the fiduciary or prohibited transaction rules of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Laws. The sale of**
**any Notes to a Plan is in no respect a representation by the Issuers, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers**
**or any of their affiliates or representatives that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements**
**with respect to investments by any such Plan generally or any particular Plan, or that such investment is**
**appropriate for such Plans generally or any particular Plan.**

In addition, the foregoing discussion is based upon the provisions of ERISA and the Code and related guidance in
effect as of the date of this offering memorandum. Future legislation, court decisions, administrative regulations
or other guidance may change the requirements summarized in this section. Any of these changes could be made
retroactively and could apply to transactions entered into before the change is enacted.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

The Issuers have agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase from
the Issuers, the entire principal amount of the Notes. The sale of the Notes will be made pursuant to a purchase
agreement among the Issuers and the Initial Purchasers to be dated the date of the final offering memorandum
(the “Purchase Agreement”).

The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to purchase
the Notes from the Issuers, are several and not joint. The Purchase Agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers
will purchase all the Notes if they purchase any of them.

The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the issue price that appears on the cover of
this offering memorandum. After the initial Offering, the Initial Purchasers may change the price at which the
Notes are offered and any other selling terms at any time without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell
the Notes through certain of their affiliates, including in respect of sales into the United States. To the extent that
any Initial Purchaser that is not a U.S. registered broker dealer intends to effect any sales of the Notes in the
United States, it will do so through one or more U.S. registered broker dealer affiliates as permitted by guidelines
promulgated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw,
cancel or modify offers to investors and to reject orders in whole or in part.

Persons who purchase the Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other
charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price set
forth on the cover page hereof.

The Issuers have agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their services in connection with
this Offering and to reimburse them for certain out of pocket expenses.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of
Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel. The Purchase
Agreement also provides that, if an Initial Purchaser defaults, the purchase commitments of the non-defaulting
Initial Purchasers may be increased or, in some cases, the Offering may be terminated.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the Issuers and each of the Guarantors will indemnify and hold harmless
the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will contribute
to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. We have agreed not to offer,
sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided under the Purchase Agreement, any debt
securities of, or guaranteed by, the Issuers and the Guarantors or any of their subsidiaries that are substantially
similar to the Notes during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the date
falling 45 days after the closing of the Offering without the prior written consent of Goldman Sachs International,
Barclays and Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited.

The Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may
not be offered or sold within the United States except to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A
and to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Until 40 days after the later of
(i) the commencement of the Offering and (ii) the Issue Date of the Notes, an offer or sale of the Notes initially
sold in reliance on Regulation S within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the
Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise
than in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings
given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Notice to Certain
_Investors” and “Transfer Restrictions.”_

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it:

- has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section
21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which
section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuers or any Guarantor; and

- has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by
it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by us or the
Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of
this offering memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for
this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this

486


-----

offering memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be
distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules
and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to
sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful.
Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to
observe any restrictions relating to the offering of the Notes, the distribution of this offering memorandum and
resale of the Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

The Issuers have also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose
of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or
disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act or the safe harbors of
Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes.

The Issuers will apply, through their Listing Agent, for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the
Official List of the Exchange; however, the Issuers cannot assure you that such listing will be obtained or, if
obtained, maintained.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable
law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market making
activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In
addition, any such market making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act and the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “U.S. Exchange Act”). Accordingly, we cannot assure you
that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell
any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating
_Each Series of Notes—Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the_
_Notes.”_

The Initial Purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty
bids in accordance with Regulation M under the U.S. Exchange Act. Over allotment involves sales in excess of
the offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchaser. Stabilizing transactions permit
the Initial Purchasers to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified
maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has
been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling
concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a
stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions.

In connection with the offering, the Stabilizing Managers, or a person acting on their behalf, may engage in
transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the Stabilizing
Managers may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining
the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Managers may also over-allot the Offering, creating a syndicate short
position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In
addition, the Stabilizing Managers may bid for and purchase Notes in market making transactions as permitted
by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the
respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Managers is
not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can
be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Each
_Series of Notes—Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes.”_

These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to be
higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on or after
the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the offering of the Notes is made and, if
commenced, may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers. If these activities are
commenced, they must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the date of issuance of the Notes and 60 days
after the date of the allotment of the Notes. These transactions may be effected in the over the counter market or
otherwise.

Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in
two Business Days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6 1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) unless the parties
to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment
on or about the date specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be business
days following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+ “).
Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade such Notes on the date of this offering memorandum or the next

487


-----

succeeding Business Days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any
such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult
their own advisors.

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory,
investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the Initial
Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past, are currently providing, or
may in the future provide, investment banking, financial advisory, commercial banking, various lending,
hedging, guarantee or other banking or budgeting services to us and our affiliates under bilateral agreements or
local facilities in the ordinary course of business, for which they have received or may receive customary fees
and commissions. The Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may also receive allocations of the Notes. In addition,
the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates will act as mandated lead arrangers and original lenders, as
applicable under the Senior Facilities Agreement, which we will enter into as borrowers and draw to provide
financing for the Acquisition. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may act as counterparties in
hedging arrangements. In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers or certain of their affiliates, including UBS
Europe SE, advised the Sponsors on the Acquisition. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have
provided a bridge facility that will be cancelled on the Issue Date. In connection with their services in such
capacities, the Initial Purchasers have received, or will receive, customary fees.

In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a
broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and
financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such
investments and securities activities may involve securities and instruments of ours or our affiliates. If the Initial
Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, they routinely hedge their credit exposure to us
consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

**Germany**

The EUR SSN Issuer, the SUN Issuer and the Issue Date Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of
Germany. Most of our directors and executive officers live outside the United States. A substantial portion of our
assets and the assets of our directors and executive officers are located outside the United States. As a result,
although we have appointed an agent for service of process under the Indentures governing the Notes, it may be
difficult for you to serve process on those persons or us in the United States or to enforce judgments obtained in
U.S. courts against them or us based on civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States.

There is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil liabilities based on federal or state securities laws of
the United States, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. federal or
state courts. The United States and the Federal Republic of Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for
the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial
matters. The enforceability of final judgments therefore may depend on the laws of the relevant U.S. state and
federal laws of the United States. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by any federal or state court
in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not
automatically be enforceable in Germany. A final judgment by a U.S. federal or state court, however, may be
recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the
proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German
court generally will not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted
below.

German courts will, in particular, not recognize and enforce such judgments if the judgment is not final under
applicable U.S. federal or state law or if any of the reasons for excluding enforceability set forth in section 328(1)
of the German Code of Civil Procedure exist:

- if, pursuant to German law, the U.S. federal or state court having rendered the foreign judgment did not
have jurisdiction;

- if process has not been duly served or has not been served in a timely fashion to permit a defense, provided
that the defendant did not actively participate in such process and pleads accordingly;

- if the judgment is incompatible with a prior judgment rendered by a German court or by a foreign court
which is to be recognized in Germany;

- if the judgment, or the proceeding resulting in the judgment, to be recognized is incompatible with a
proceeding in Germany which was pending (rechtshängig) before a German court before the U.S. federal or
state court entered its judgment;

- if a recognition of the judgment would be obviously incompatible with essential principles of German law,
in particular, if the recognition would be incompatible with the civil rights (Grundrechte) guaranteed by
virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz); and

- if reciprocity is not ensured (i.e., the U.S. federal or state courts would not recognize and enforce a
comparable judgment by a German court in equivalent circumstances).

Subject to the foregoing, holders of the Notes may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial matters
obtained from U.S. federal or state courts in Germany. There is some German case law to the effect that
reciprocity of the recognition of judgments is ensured in relation to claims relating to assets
(vermögensrechtliche Ansprüche) with regard to various U.S. states. We cannot, however, assure you that
attempts to enforce judgments in Germany will be successful. It is also doubtful whether a German court would
accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action solely predicated by U.S. federal securities
laws.

In addition, the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages are usually denied by German courts as
incompatible with the essential principles of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the amount of
damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate
actual losses or damages.

Consequently, judgments awarding monetary damages under civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal
securities laws may not be enforceable to the extent they provide for a compensation that would qualify as being
of a penal or punitive nature.

-----

German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. In so far as the
production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law
provided for pretrial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the
production of documents by adverse or third parties and/or the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this
matter may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pretrial discovery process exists under
German law.

In addition, it may under certain circumstances also not be possible for investors to effect service of process
within Germany upon the German Notes Guarantors or those persons under the Convention on the Service
Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 and the
German law implementing such convention if such service were deemed to infringe German sovereignty or
security, which may be the case if such service violated the fundamental principles of German law, in particular
the civil rights (Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz). However, the
German Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) held in 2013 that service may not be denied solely
because the action before the U.S. court contains claims for punitive damages.

**Canada**

The following discussion with respect to the enforceability of certain United States court judgments in the
Canadian province of Ontario is based upon advice provided to us by our Canadian counsel. The United States
and Canada currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments
(as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. However, under the laws of the Province of
Ontario and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein therein (“Ontario Law”), a court of competent
jurisdiction in Ontario (a “Canadian Court”) would give a judgment based upon on a final and conclusive in
personam judgment of a court exercising jurisdiction in the State of New York (a “New York Court”) for a sum
certain, obtained against the Guarantors with respect to a claim arising out of the Note Guarantees (a “New York
Judgment”), without reconsideration of the merits, provided that:

(a) the New York Court rendering such judgment had jurisdiction over the Guarantors, as recognized by
Ontario Law (and submission by each Issuer and each Guarantor in connection with the Note Guarantees to
the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the New York Court will be sufficient for that purpose);

(b) an action to enforce the New York Judgment must be commenced in the Canadian Court within any
applicable limitation period;

(c) the Canadian Court has discretion to stay or decline to hear an action on the New York Judgment if the New
York Judgment is under appeal or there is another subsisting judgment in any jurisdiction relating to the
same cause of action as the New York Judgment;

(d) under the Currency Act (Canada), the Canadian Court may only render judgment for a sum of money in
Canadian dollars, and in enforcing a foreign judgment for a sum of money in a foreign currency, a Canadian
Court will render its decision in the Canadian dollar equivalent of such foreign currency;

(e) an action in the Canadian Court on the New York Judgment may be affected by bankruptcy, insolvency or
other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally; and

(f) such enforcement would be subject to the following defenses:

(i) the New York Judgment was obtained by fraud or in a manner contrary to the principles of natural
justice, provided that the New York Judgment would not be contrary to natural justice by reason only
that service of process was effected on the agent for service of process appointed by the Guarantors
pursuant to the Note Guarantees;

(ii) the New York Judgment is for a claim which under Ontario Law would be characterized as based on a
foreign revenue, expropriatory, penal or other public law;

(iii) the New York Judgment is contrary to public policy under Ontario Law or to an order made by the
Attorney General of Canada under the Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act (Canada) or by the
Competition Tribunal under the Competition Act (Canada) in respect of certain judgments referred to
in these statutes; and

(iv) the New York Judgment has been satisfied or is void or voidable under the laws of the State of
New York.

**The Netherlands**

thyssenkrupp Stairlifts B.V. and SkyLift B.V. are incorporated under Dutch law (the “Dutch Guarantors”). As a
result, it may be difficult for investors to enforce judgments obtained in non-Dutch courts against the Dutch
Guarantors.

The Netherlands does not currently have a treaty with the United States providing for reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final
judgment for the payment of money rendered by any court in any federal or state court in the United States based
on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon United States federal securities laws, would not
automatically be recognized or enforceable in the Netherlands. In order to obtain a judgment which is
enforceable in the Netherlands, the claim must be re-litigated before a competent Dutch court. Under current
practice, the courts of the Netherlands may be expected to render a judgment in accordance with the judgment of
the relevant U.S. court, provided that such judgment (i) is a final judgment and has been rendered by a court
which has established its jurisdiction vis-à-vis the Dutch Guarantors on the basis of internationally accepted
grounds of jurisdiction, (ii) was rendered in after proper service of process and using proper judicial procedure
(behoorlijke rechtspleging), (iii) is not contrary to the public policy (openbare orde) of the Netherlands, (iv) is
not incompatible with (a) a prior judgment of a Dutch court rendered in a dispute between the same parties, or
(b) a prior judgment of a non-Dutch court rendered in a dispute between the same parties, concerning the same
subject matter and based on the same cause of action, provided that such prior judgment is capable of being
recognized in the Netherlands and (v) the judgment is—according to the law of its country of origin— formally
capable of being enforced (e.g. is readily enforceable, has not been annulled in appeal or its enforceability has
not been subject to a certain time frame).

Subject to the foregoing and service of process in accordance with applicable treaties, investors may be able to
enforce in the Netherlands judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts.
However, no assurance can be given that those judgments will be enforceable. In addition, it is doubtful whether
a Dutch court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action commenced in the
Netherlands and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

Any enforcement of agreements governed by foreign law and any foreign judgments in the Netherlands will be
subject to the rules of Dutch civil procedure. Judgments may be rendered in a foreign currency but enforcement
is executed in EUR at the applicable rate of exchange. Enforcement of obligations in the Netherlands will be
subject to the nature of the remedies available in the courts of the Netherlands. The taking of concurrent
proceedings in more than one jurisdiction may be disallowed by the courts of the Netherlands, but such courts
have the power to stay proceedings (aanhouden) if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere.

Dutch courts may deny the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages or other awards. Moreover, a Dutch
court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that
they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. Enforcement and recognition of judgments of U.S.
courts in the Netherlands are solely governed by the provisions of the Dutch Civil Procedure Code (Wetboek van
_Burgerlijke Rechtsvordering)._

Enforcement of obligations before a Dutch court will be subject to the degree to which the relevant obligations
are enforceable under their governing law, to the nature of the remedies available in Dutch courts, the acceptance
by such courts of jurisdiction, the effect of provisions imposing prescription periods and to the availability of
defenses such as set off (unless validly waived) and counter-claim; specific performance may not always be
awarded.

**01 Basis of preparation**

**•** **General information**

On May 21, 2019, the Supervisory Board of thyssenkrupp Aktiengesellschaft, Duisburg and Essen, Germany
(hereafter “thyssenkrupp AG”) unanimously approved the Executive Board’s plans for a fundamental strategic
realignment of the group. As part of this new strategy, the Executive Board proposed an initial public offering
(hereafter “IPO”) of thyssenkrupp Elevator Technology Business (hereafter “Elevator Technology Business”) to
the Supervisory Board. In addition to the IPO thyssenkrupp AG was also contemplating a full trade sale of the
Elevator Technology Business to potential interested parties.

On February 27, 2020, the Executive Board’s decision to sell its entire Elevator Technology Business to a
consortium led by Advent, Cinven and RAG foundation (hereafter “the transaction”) was approved by the
Supervisory Board of thyssenkrupp AG. The closing of this transaction is expected by the end of the current
fiscal year. thyssenkrupp AG will reinvest part of the purchase price in a stake in the Elevator Technology
Business.

The thyssenkrupp Elevator Technology Group (hereafter “thyssenkrupp ET Group”)—which designs and
delivers passenger transportation solutions—has been separated from thyssenkrupp AG and its subsidiaries
(hereafter “thyssenkrupp Group”). In an initial preparatory step, the thyssenkrupp ET Group operating activities
that had previously not been operating as separate companies were transferred to separate legal entities. In a
second step, all companies making up the thyssenkrupp ET Group were transferred to wholly-owned subsidiaries
of thyssenkrupp AG, i.e. thyssenkrupp Elevator International Holding B.V., Roermond, Netherlands or to
thyssenkrupp Elevator Innovation and Operations AG, Düsseldorf, Germany, which was previously named
thyssenkrupp Elevator AG until December 10, 2019. On June 2, 2020 thyssenkrupp Elevator Innovation and
Operations AG changed its legal form to thyssenkrupp Elevator Innovations and Operations GmbH (hereafter
“thyssenkrupp Elevator laO[1]”). In further steps, thyssenkrupp Elevator International Holding B.V. and its
subsidiaries and the thyssenkrupp Elevator laO and its subsidiaries were then transferred at December 6, 2019
and at December 31, 2019, respectively, to a new company named thyssenkrupp Elevator Holding GmbH, Essen,
Germany (formerly thyssenkrupp Industrials GmbH, Essen, Germany, that was founded in June 2018 under the
name thyssenkrupp Carbon2Chem Management GmbH, Duisburg, Germany). As of December 31, 2019, both
companies are therefore 100%-subsidiaries of thyssenkrupp Elevator Holding GmbH, which is the parent
company of the thyssenkrupp ET Group. On January 16, 2020, name and legal form of the thyssenkrupp Elevator
Holding GmbH was changed to thyssenkrupp Elevator AG (hereafter “the Company[2]”).

The transferred Elevator Technology Business operations are comprised of legal entities as well as assets and
liabilities that have been transferred to the Company with effect from December 31, 2019, as part of the legal
reorganization that in accordance with IFRS 10.B97 “Consolidated Financial Statements” are deemed linked
transactions. This reorganization is a transaction under common control, since all transferred legal entities as well
as assets and liabilities are ultimately controlled by thyssenkrupp AG.

Up to and until December 31, 2019, the date of the completion of the legal reorganization, there was no
obligation for the Company to prepare consolidated financial statements for the thyssenkrupp ET Group because
the Elevator Technology Business was not a group of entities under control of a parent as defined by IFRS 10
“Consolidated Financial Statements” and has historically not prepared consolidated financial statements for
internal or external reporting purpose. Combined financial statements in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as applicable in the European Union were prepared for the Elevator Technology
Business as of and for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The combined annual financial
statements are hereinafter referred to as the “Combined Financial Statements”. The Combined Financial
Statements of the Elevator Technology Business reflect the Elevator Technology Business as historically
included in the IFRS consolidated financial statements of thyssenkrupp AG under application of the predecessor
accounting (book value) approach in accordance with established practice in accounting for business
combinations under common control under IFRS. These Combined Financial Statements are expected to be
published for the purpose of a bond offering in June 2020.

1 Until December 10, 2019, thyssenkrupp Elevator IaO refers to thyssenkrupp Elevator AG. Subsequent to December 10, 2019 until
June 2, 2020, thyssenkrupp Elevator IaO refers to thyssenkrupp Elevator Innovation and Operations AG. Starting on June 2, 2020,
thyssenkrupp Elevator IaO refers to thyssenkrupp Elevator Innovation and Operations GmbH.

2 Until January 16, 2020, the Company refers to thyssenkrupp Elevator Holding GmbH. Starting on January 16, 2020, the Company refers
to thyssenkrupp Elevator AG.

**01 Basis of preparation (Continued)**

**•** **First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards**

Since December 31, 2019, the date of the completion of the legal reorganization, the Elevator Technology
Business is a group of entities under the control of the Company as defined by IFRS 10 “Consolidated Financial
Statements.” Therefore, first-time consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2020 have to be
prepared in accordance with the rules of IFRS 1 “First-Time adoption of International Financial Reporting
Standards”. The interim financial statements as of and for the 1st half year ended March 31, 2020 (the
**“Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements”) for the group of entities under the control of the**
Company are also prepared in accordance with IFRS 1.

The Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements presented here are based on uniform IFRS accounting
policies with an opening statement of financial position as of October 1, 2018. As consolidated financial
statements were previously not prepared for the thyssenkrupp ET Group, the reconciliations envisioned in
principle pursuant to IFRS 1 are not required.

For purposes of the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements the above noted transactions of the
legal reorganization have been accounted for as common control transactions by applying predecessor accounting
(book value) in accordance with recognized industry practice for business combinations under common control[3].
The Company’s interim consolidated financial statement include the results of the thyssenkrupp ET Group as of
and for the 1st half year ended March 31, 2020 as well as the comparatives results as if the transfer of the
business activities of the Elevator Technology Business into the Company had already taken place for all periods
presented. The financials of the Elevator Technology Business activities prior to the reorganization as of
December 31, 2019 are presented on a combined basis under the application of the same principles as applied in
the Combined Financial Statements.

IFRS accounting standards adopted by thyssenkrupp AG in the 1st half year ended March 31, 2020 for the first
time were incorporated in the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company in
accordance with the respective date of first-time adoption of thyssenkrupp AG to reflect the book values as
historically included in the IFRS consolidated financial statements of thyssenkrupp AG under application of the
predecessor accounting (book value) approach. Since thyssenkrupp AG applies IFRS 16 “Leases” using the
modified retrospective approach starting October 1, 2019 in its consolidated financial statements, IFRS 16 will
be applied at the same date using the same approach in the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements
in accordance with the rules described above.

**•** **Information on the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements**

The Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements comprise interim consolidated statements of financial
position, interim consolidated statements of profit or loss, interim consolidated statements of comprehensive
income, interim consolidated statements of cash flows, interim consolidated statements of changes in equity and
selected notes to the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the 1st half year ended
March 31, 2020 including the corresponding comparative information as of and for the 1st half year ended
March 31, 2019, and in addition for the comparative information as of September 30, 2019 and October1, 2018
for the interim consolidated statements of financial position.

The interim consolidated statement of profit or loss has been prepared using the cost-of-sales method. Assets and
liabilities are classified by maturity. They are classified as current if they mature within one year or within the
normal business cycle of the companies and operations included in the thyssenkrupp ET Group or are held for
sale. Inventories and trade accounts receivable and payable are generally presented as current. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities as well as pension provisions are generally presented as noncurrent.

The interim consolidated statement of changes in equity presents changes in capital stock, additional paid-in
capital, retained earnings as well as changes in other comprehensive income attributable to shareholders of
thyssenkrupp Elevator AG and the changes in equity to non-controlling interest in the respective reporting
period. Since the thyssenkrupp ET Group has a complex financial history and not constituted a group with a
parent entity for the comparative periods presented, no share capital is presented in the statements of changes in
equity for the comparative periods. The interim consolidated statements of cash flows is prepared using the
indirect method.

**Selected Notes to the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**01 Basis of preparation (Continued)**

The Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in euros, with all amounts rounded to the
nearest million (million €) except when otherwise indicated; this may result in differences compared to the
unrounded figures.

For further explanations of the Elevator Technology Business and additional information reference is made to the
Combined Financial Statements for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, September 30, 2018 and
September 30, 2017. This Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction
with these Combined Financial Statements.

The Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared on [•], 2020 by the Executive Board of
the Company.

 - **Basis of preparation of the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements**

**Compliance with IFRS**

The following Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company were prepared in
accordance with IFRS as well as the related interpretations of the IFRS Interpretation Committee (“IFRIC”) as
they are to be applied in the EU at the end of the last reporting period presented. They also satisfy the
requirements for first-time consolidated financial statements in accordance with the rules of IFRS 1 and have
been prepared in a condensed form according to IAS 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” as endorsed by the EU.

In the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company, the predecessor accounting
approach has been applied in accordance with recognized industry practice for business combinations under
common control. The Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company reflect the Elevator
Technology companies and the operating activities assigned to the Elevator Technology Business as historically
included in the IFRS consolidated financial statements of thyssenkrupp AG. In general, the Company applied the
same accounting policies and measurement principles in preparing the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial
Statements as were used in preparing the IFRS consolidated financial statements of thyssenkrupp AG (using the
“extraction method”). This approach was adjusted with respect to transactions with remaining thyssenkrupp
Group companies and to ensure IFRS compliance. Transactions between the thyssenkrupp ET Group and the
remaining thyssenkrupp Group were recognized in accordance with IFRS and classified as related party
transactions as defined in IAS 24 “Related Party Disclosures”.

Reference is made where appropriate to the Combined Financial Statements in particular to the combination,
recognition and measurement principles.

For further information concerning the basis of preparation see also the Combined Financial Statements.

**Scope of consolidation**

In the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements, the direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company
were fully consolidated in accordance with the principles of IFRS 10. In addition, joint ventures were accounted
for in the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements using the equity method in accordance with
IAS 28 “Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures”.

For a full list of the companies and Elevator Technology Business operating activities included in the scope of
combination see the Combined Financial Statements. There have been no material changes in the scope of
consolidation in the 1st half year ended March 31, 2020.

**Treatment of costs for central services**

Until December 31, 2019, the thyssenkrupp ET Group has obtained controlling, accounting, human resources, IT
and infrastructure services from thyssenkrupp Group service companies, such as thyssenkrupp Regional Services
Germany GmbH, Essen, Germany.

**Selected Notes to the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**01 Basis of preparation (Continued)**

In addition, holding companies such as thyssenkrupp AG have provided various central services including
governance to the thyssenkrupp ET Group. These services were historically reported in the thyssenkrupp Group
and either were transferred to the thyssenkrupp ET Group as part of the legal reorganization or will be provided
as a service under transitional service agreements (hereafter “TSAs”) starting January 1, 2020. As of now, there
are TSAs for almost all central services (e.g. IT, HR, Legal) provided by the thyssenkrupp Group. Going
forward, it is planned to terminate these existing TSAs and to establish these central services at the thyssenkrupp
ET Group.

The respective income and costs for such services that were historically recharged to the thyssenkrupp ET Group,
have been included in the interim consolidated statement of profit or loss at their historical amounts. Where
income and costs for such services in the periods until December 31, 2019 were historically not recharged but
were essential to the operational business of the thyssenkrupp ET Group, such income and costs were either
directly attributed or, where this was not possible, allocated using appropriate allocation keys and are reflected in
the interim consolidated statements of profit or loss at their historical cost.

Furthermore, assets or liabilities relating to administrative services, service companies or the central activities of
the holding companies pertained to the thyssenkrupp ET Group were attributed in the Unaudited Interim
Consolidated Financial Statements based on the legal reorganization principle. Shared assets relating to such
holding companies that did not legally transfer to the thyssenkrupp ET Group were not included in the interim
consolidated statements of financial position of the Company. However, for such an appropriate usage charge
was reflected in the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements in the reporting periods until
December 31, 2019. Shared assets relating to such holding companies that did legally transfer to the
thyssenkrupp ET Group, were included in the interim consolidated statements of financial position of the
Company. The usage by the remaining thyssenkrupp Group was accounted for by way of appropriate usage
income charges to the remaining thyssenkrupp Group in the reporting periods until December 31, 2019.
Administrative services or central activities will be continued after closing of the transaction by TSAs that have
been implemented January 01, 2020. Services as part of the TSAs might result in different cost charges compared
to the current allocation.

**thyssenkrupp brand**

In the periods up to September 30, 2019, the Elevator Technology Business was using the thyssenkrupp brand
under an operating licensing model for which it incurred expenses recognized directly in profit or loss in other
expenses. As of September 30, 2019, as part of the proposed IPO, the Elevator Technology Business had entered
into a new license agreement with thyssenkrupp AG for the right to use the thyssenkrupp brand for certain
specified classes relevant for the Elevator Technology Business in exchange for a one-time fee and with no other
recurring expenses after September 30, 2019 (hereafter “new license agreement”). This license has been
recognized as an intangible asset with indefinite useful life in accordance with IAS 38 “Intangible Assets” as of
September 30, 2019. Historically recognized expenses for the use of the brand remain unchanged for the periods
up to September 30, 2019.

Based on the Executive Board’s decision as of February 27, 2020 to sell the entire thyssenkrupp ET Group the
above described new license agreement, entered into on September 30, 2019, was adjusted in March 2020 via an
addendum agreement, since the governance model in the new license agreement was only suitable with an IPO.
In substance, the terms and conditions of the addendum agreement lead to a limitation of the initially agreed
indefinite useful life.

The terms of the addendum agreement become effective subject to the condition precedent of all closing
conditions of the transaction being fulfilled and will result in the repayment of the initially agreed fully paid up
one-time fee in the amount of €1,080 million reduced by a fixed amount of €99 million for the use of the brand
starting October 1, 2019 until closing. In addition, a fixed amount of €74 million for the use of the brand for the
period of no longer than 18 months after closing was agreed. Both, the amount receivable and the amount
payable, are due immediately prior to closing. With the signing of the addendum agreement the intangible asset
for the right of use of the thyssenkrupp brand is classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5.

**Selected Notes to the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**01 Basis of preparation (Continued)**

**Capital structure**

The consolidated statement of changes in equity presents capital stock (of thyssenkrupp Elevator AG), additional
paid-in capital (of thyssenkrupp Elevator AG), retained earnings as well as cumulative other comprehensive
income and non-controlling interest for the interim reporting period ending March 31, 2020.

Since the thyssenkrupp ET Group has a complex financial history and did not constitute a consolidated group
with a parent entity for the reporting periods until December 31, 2019, no capital stock, additional paid-in capital
retained earnings are presented in the statement of changes in equity for the comparative period. For such periods
the equity of the thyssenkrupp ET Group consists of the invested equity attributable to the thyssenkrupp Group,
other components of equity and the invested equity attributable to non-controlling interest. Since the
thyssenkrupp ET Group had no share capital and reserves in its own right, any equity presented until
December 31, 2019 represents the parent’s net investment. Thus, the presentation of the equity for the reporting
periods until December 31, 2019 of the thyssenkrupp ET Group differs from the presentation of equity as
prescribed in IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements”.

During the reporting period under consideration, the thyssenkrupp ET Group was mainly financed by the
remaining thyssenkrupp Group. The capital structure of the thyssenkrupp ET Group at the time of the closing of
the transaction will differ from the capital structure presented in the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial
Statements.

**Future financing and liquidity planning**

Until closing of the transaction, thyssenkrupp ET Group is integrated into the cash pooling and cash management
systems of the thyssenkrupp Group. During the last months thyssenkrupp ET Group has implemented an
additional cash pooling and cash management system with the cash pool leader thyssenkrupp Elevator AG.

With Closing the settlement of all intercompany balances with thyssenkrupp Group is expected to result in a
slightly positive cash balance for thyssenkrupp ET Group. Additionally selected thyssenkrupp ET Group
companies, which were not integrated in the cash pooling and cash management systems of the thyssenkrupp
Group due to commercial or regulatory purposes, are expected to show positive cash balances at closing.

Against this background and under consideration of a sufficient free cash flow according to the latest planning
thyssenkrupp ET Group management expects to be able to fulfill all of its future payment obligations. In order to
additionally secure the financing of operating activities, thyssenkrupp ET Group plans to have access to a
Revolving Credit Facility in an amount of €800 million.

After closing the thyssenkrupp ET Group plans to have access to appropriate guarantee facilities, either under a
central Revolving Guarantee Facility or under additional bilateral agreements of thyssenkrupp ET Group
companies, fully satisfying the operative business requirements.

**Income taxes and deferred taxes**

Current and deferred income taxes are recognized in accordance with IAS 12 and IAS 34 in the Unaudited
Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. For the comparative period, income taxes were determined using the
separate tax return approach based on the assumption that the companies and operations of the Elevator
Technology Business constitute separate tax payers. This assumption implies that current and deferred taxes for
all companies (share deal companies) and operations (asset deal companies) within Elevator Technology
Business are calculated separately and that the recoverability of deferred tax assets is assessed on this basis.
Legal entities and business operating activities are treated for purposes of the separate tax return approach as a
tax group if such legal entities and business operations have historically been included in a tax group and as of
December 31, 2019 have operated under a new tax group or are still included within the historical tax group.

Deferred tax assets resulting from tax loss carryforwards are recognized in the Unaudited Interim Consolidated
Financial Statements to the extent that it is probable that they can be offset against positive results from the
respective thyssenkrupp ET Group companies or operations in the future. This is only applicable if the legal
entity is part of the thyssenkrupp ET Group and to the extent the legal entity has tax loss carryforwards legally
assessed.

F-12


-----

**Selected Notes to the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**01 Basis of preparation (Continued)**

For companies or operations that did not constitute a separate tax payer in the historical reporting period (e.g.
companies being part of a fiscal unity or asset deal companies) the following particularities apply:

 - Tax expense and tax income are recognized in the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements in
the years in which they arose as contributions or withdrawals by the shareholders immediately settled in
equity;

 - Current losses trigger tax income, if it is probable that sufficient future taxable profit will be available. This
tax income is treated as withdrawal by the shareholders in the respective year;

 - Tax receivables, tax liabilities and deferred tax assets from current losses are not shown in the Unaudited
Interim Consolidated Financial Statements unless the company has own tax loss carryforwards which are
legally assessed.

In the interim consolidated statements of cash flows, the taxes actually paid to tax authorities as well as current
taxes allocated based on the separate tax return approach were included as inflows/outflows from operating
activities. Taxes allocated to thyssenkrupp ET Group under the separate tax return approach were deemed
immediately settled.

Payments made to the remaining thyssenkrupp Group under historical tax group arrangements are also included
as inflows/outflows from operating activities.

The management of the thyssenkrupp ET Group deems this approach as applied for the comparative period as
appropriate but not necessarily indicative of the tax expense or income as well as tax payments that would result
for thyssenkrupp ET Group as a separate group.

**Control and profit or loss transfer agreements**

The control and profit or loss transfer agreement (Beherrschungs- und Gewinnabführungsverträge) between the
German thyssenkrupp ET Group companies and the remaining thyssenkrupp Group has been terminated as of
December 31, 2019. For the purposes of the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements of the
Company, receivables and liabilities to the remaining thyssenkrupp Group in connection with control and profit
or loss transfer agreement were presented as other financial assets and other financial liabilities, respectively. The
related impacts of the profit or loss transfer agreement are shown as contributions or withdrawals from reserves
by the shareholders and are included in the line item “Other transactions with the remaining thyssenkrupp
Group” of the interim consolidated statement of changes in equity and the line item “Payments received under
profit and loss transfer agreements” of the interim consolidated statement of cash flows.

**Critical accounting estimates**

In preparing the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements, certain assumptions and estimates were
made. These assumptions and estimates affect the amounts and the reporting of recognized assets and liabilities,
income and expenses and contingent liabilities. The actual amounts may vary from these estimates.

The scope of consolidation includes activities relating to the Operating Unit Spanish Latin America that is
comprised of the entities listed below. Issues surrounding local bookkeeping and financial reporting processes
led to instances of qualified, adverse or disclaimer of opinions on statutory financial information of certain of
these entities for the reporting periods ending on September 30, 2018/ October 1, 2018 and September 30, 2019.

As a consequence, the reporting packages for the reporting periods ending on September 30, 2018/ October 1,
2018 and the 1st half year ended March 31, 2019, were adjusted by management based on their current best
estimate. The balance sheets for the entities as of September 30, 2019 were completely verified and corrected
accordingly by management.

As a result, the following adjustments were recognized in comparison to the initial reported financial information
(unaudited):

 - a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of €(38) million as of September 30, 2019 (March 31, 2019: €(25)
million; October 1, 2018: €(25) million),

 - an increase/decrease in inventories of €10 million as of September 30, 2019 (March 31, 2019: €(2) million;
October 1, 2018: €(2) million),

**02 COVID-19**

Since January 2020, there is a progressive global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in various
actions—including lockdowns—that have been taken by governments all over the world in order to contain and
to control the virus. COVID-19 impacted the markets and facilities in multiple ways, depending on the local
exposure to the virus and the measures taken by local governments:

 - Our segments Asia Pacific (AP), Americas (AMS) and Europe/Africa (EA), which comprise our elevator
and escalator business, were affected to varying degrees. Nevertheless, the effect of the COVID-19 was felt
in all regions, leading to complete lockdowns in some regions and milder restrictions in others. In Asia
Pacific, temporary restrictions were mainly observed in China with recovery to almost normal operation in
March 2020. India was also affected by government restrictions with lockdowns of facilities. In the
Americas, some reductions observed in Brazil while production in the US remained mainly at normal levels,
with only temporary restrictions on construction sites and service operations. In Europe/Africa, most
impacted countries were Spain, France, Italy and Germany, with some site restrictions and temporary
reductions or lockdowns in productions facilities. In most countries production capacities in our core
factories have almost recovered to pre-pandemic levels.

 - The Access Solutions segment was affected in both business lines, Home Solutions and Airport Solutions.
Activities for Home Solutions have been operated at a lower level with partial temporary shut downs of

production facilities but are recovering constantly. The partial or complete shutdown of most airports has
led to a decrease of New Installation and Service operations due to postponements and suspensions of some
projects.

The COVID-19 pandemic is considered as a triggering event for an impairment test of goodwill per March 31,
2020. Before March 31, 2020, all groups of cash-generating units of the Elevator Technology Business showed
significant headroom. In addition, the key performance indicators of the operational planning of Elevator
Technology were tested for validity against the background of the COVID-19 pandemic and, in effect, the
recoverability of goodwill of the Elevator Technology Business was not classified as critical. The weighted
average cost of capital discount rate (WACC) for all but one cash-generating units of the Elevator Technology
Business decreased compared to September 30, 2019, mainly due to decreasing beta factors. The WACC is based
on a risk-free interest rate of 0.1% (September 30, 2019: 0.1%) and a market risk premium of 7.5%
(September 30, 2019: 6.75%). Furthermore, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment were also
tested for impairment per March 31, 2020 which did not result in any impairment losses for the Elevator
Technology Business. Based on the uncertain progress of the COVID-19 pandemic, it cannot yet reasonably be
predicted to what extent the pandemic will affect the future financial position and results of operations of the
Elevator Technology Business. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic the accumulated ADJ EBIT of the
Elevator Technology Business is currently slightly below the budgeted expectations.

**03 Recently adopted accounting standards**

In fiscal year ending September 30, 2020 the thyssenkrupp ET Group adopted the following standard,
interpretation and amendments to already existing standards that, with the exemption of IFRS 16, do not have a
material impact on the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements.

**Adoption of IFRS 16**

In January 2016, the IASB published the new accounting standard IFRS 16 Leases. The new standard replaces
the previous classification of leases into operating and finance leases as a lessee and introduces a uniform
accounting model for the lessee. Under the previous standard (IAS 17), lease obligations for operating leases
were only to be disclosed in the notes. In accordance with IFRS 16, the rights and obligations resulting from
leases must be recognized as a right-of-use of the leased asset and a corresponding lease liability in the lessee’s
statement of financial position.

This resulted in the following recognition and measurement principles:

A contract constitutes a lease if the contract conveys the lessee

 - the right to control the use of an identified asset (the leased asset)

 - for a specific period

 - in exchange for a consideration.

Since October 1, 2019, the thyssenkrupp ET Group as a lessee recognizes in general for all leases within the
interim consolidated statement of financial position an asset for the right-of-use of the leased assets and a liability
for the lease payment commitments at present value. These are primarily rentals of property and buildings,
technical machinery and equipment as well as other equipment, factory and office equipment. The right-of-use
assets reported under property, plant and equipment are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation and
impairment losses. Payments for non-lease components are not included in the determination of the lease
liability. The lease liabilities reported under financial liabilities reflect the present value of the outstanding lease
payments at the time the asset is made available for use. Lease payments are discounted at the interest rate
implicit in the lease if it can be readily determined. Otherwise, they are discounted at the lessee’s incremental
borrowing rate. The derivation of the interest rate is based on the assumption that an adequate amount of funds
will be raised over an adequate period of time in the amount of an asset comparable to the right-of-use asset,
taking into account the economic environment and comparable collateral.

The lease liabilities include the following lease payments:

 - Fixed payments, less lease incentives to be paid by the lessor;

F-16


-----

**Selected Notes to the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**03 Recently adopted accounting standards (Continued)**

 - variable lease payments that are based on an index or an interest rate;

 - expected amounts to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;

 - the exercise price of a purchase option, if the exercise is reasonably certain and

 - payment of penalties for the termination of the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option
to terminate the lease.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, which are comprised as follows:

 - Lease liability;

 - lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received;

 - initial direct costs; and

 - dismantling obligations.

Subsequent measurement of the right-of-use asset is performed at amortized cost. Right-of-use assets are
depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term, unless the useful life of the underlying asset is shorter. If
the lease agreement contains reasonably certain purchase options, the right of use is depreciated over the
economic life of the underlying asset.

In subsequent measurement, the lease liability is compounded, and the corresponding interest expense is
recognized in the financial result. The lease payments made reduce the carrying amount of the lease liability.

In accordance with the recognition exemptions, low-value leases of and short-term leases (less than twelve
months) are recognized in the statement of profit or loss. The thyssenkrupp ET Group has identified certain asset
classes (e.g. PCs, telephones, printers, copiers) which regularly contain leased assets of low value. Outside these
asset classes, only leased assets with a value of up to USD/€5,000 are classified as low-value leased assets.
Furthermore, the new regulations are not applied to leases of intangible assets. For contracts comprising a
non-lease component as well as a lease component, each lease component must be accounted for separately from
non-lease component as a lease. The lessee must allocate the contractually agreed-upon payment to the separate
lease components based on the relative standalone selling price of the lease component and the aggregated
standalone selling price of the non-lease components. In addition, intercompany leases will continue to be
presented in the segment report according to IFRS 8 as operating leases in accordance with IAS 17.

The term of the lease is determined based on the non-cancellable lease term. Especially real estate leases contain
extension and termination options. Such contractual conditions offer the greatest possible operational flexibility
to the thyssenkrupp ET Group. In determining the lease term, all facts and circumstances are considered that
provide an economic incentive to exercise renewal options or not to exercise termination options. Lease term
modifications from the exercise or non-exercise of such options are only considered in the lease term if they are
reasonably certain and are based on an event that is within the control of the lessee.

Use is made of the exemption option to apply IFRS 16 to all agreements that were previously identified as leases
by applying IAS 17 and IFRIC 4.

The thyssenkrupp ET Group has applied the modified retrospective approach in accordance with IFRS 16.C5(b).
In accordance with this approach the comparative prior-year figures do not have to be adjusted and the first-time
adoption effects are recognized in the retained earnings as of October 1, 2019.

The thyssenkrupp ET Group recognized new assets and liabilities for its operating leases at the date of transition
to IFRS 16. When applying the modified retrospective method, right-of-use assets were recognized at the initial
recognition date at the carrying amounts of the lease liabilities adjusted for deferred lease payments. The lease
liabilities were recognized at the present value of the lease payments outstanding at the date of first-time
application, discounted at the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate at the date of first-time application. The
thyssenkrupp ET Group made use of exemption options in the transition to IFRS 16 and treated leases with a
remaining term of up to twelve months as short-term leases, left initial direct costs unaffected in the initial
measurement of the right-of-use asset, and took current knowledge into account in determining the lease terms
for agreements with extension and/or termination options. No impairment test in accordance with IAS 36 was
carried out at the time of initial application. Instead, leases entered into immediately prior to October 1, 2019,

**03 Recently adopted accounting standards (Continued)**

were assessed in accordance with IAS 37 “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets” to
determine whether they were onerous. No onerous contracts were identified.

The effects on the thyssenkrupp ET Group’s previous finance leases were insignificant.

As of October 1, 2019, right-of-use assets in the amount of €345 million and lease liabilities in the amount of
€349 million were recognized as part of the transition to IFRS 16.

Based on the operating lease commitments as of September 30, 2019, the reconciliation to the carrying amounts
of the opening balance of the lease liabilities as of October 1, 2019 is as follows:

Based on the operating lease commitments, payments for short-term leases in the amount of €6 million, payments
for leases of low-value assets in the amount of €5 million, and payment obligations in accordance with IAS 17
for leases already signed as of September 30, 2019 in which the commencement of the underlying assets will take
place at a later date in the amount of €80 million, were deducted.

The lease liabilities were discounted as of October 1, 2019 using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate. The
weighted average interest rate was 5.4%.

The interim consolidated statement of financial position as of March 31, 2020 and the interim consolidated

The effects of the first-time adoption of the new standards were recognized directly in equity at the date of
transition but were not material for the thyssenkrupp ET Group. The effect of the first-time adoption was netted
against the derecognition of the respective deferred liability as of September 30, 2019 in equity. This also applies
to the effects with regard to deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities.

Furthermore in fiscal year 2019/2020 the thyssenkrupp ET Group adopted the following standards,
interpretations and amendments to already existing standards and interpretations that do not have a material
impact on the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements.

 - IFRIC 23: “Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments”, issued in June 2017

 - Amendments to IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”, issued in October 2017

 - Amendments to IAS 28: “Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures”, issued in October 2017

 - Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2015-2017 Cycle, issued in December 2017

 - Amendments to IAS 19: “Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement”, issued in February 2018

**04 Single asset held for sale**

Based on the Executive Board’s decision as of February 27, 2020 to sell the entire Elevator Technology Business
the new license agreement regarding the thyssenkrupp brand, entered into on September 30, 2019, was amended
in March 2020 via an addendum agreement, since the governance model in the new license agreement was only
suitable with an IPO. In substance, the terms and conditions of the addendum agreement lead to a limitation of
the initially agreed indefinite useful life.

The terms of the addendum agreement become effective subject to the condition precedent of all closing
conditions of the transaction being fulfilled and will result in the repayment of the initially agreed fully paid up
one-time fee in the amount of € 1,080 million reduced by a fixed amount of €99 million for the use of the brand
starting October 1, 2019 until closing. In addition, a fixed amount of €74 million for the use of the brand for the
period of no longer than 18 months after closing was agreed. Both, the amount receivable and the amount
payable, are due immediately prior to closing. With the signing of the addendum agreement the intangible asset
for the right of use of the thyssenkrupp brand is classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5. Prior to the
aforementioned classification as held for sale an impairment loss on the thyssenkrupp brand amounting to
€99 million has been recognized.

**05 Acquisitions**

In the year ended September 30, 2019, the Elevator Technology Business acquired the elevator business of
Nashville Machine Elevator Co., Inc. via asset deal effective May 31, 2019 and all shares of O´Keefe Elevator
Company, Inc. effective July 1, 2019. The purchase price allocation of Nashville Machine Elevator Co. has not
yet been finalized due to the pending identification of the acquired intangible assets. The purchase price
allocation of the O’Keefe Elevator Company has also not yet been finalized due to remaining clarification of
O’Keefe’s tax base. Compared to the presentation in the Combined Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2019, there have only been some minor changes.

**06 Total equity**

The changes in the various components of equity for the interim period ended March 31, 2020 are shown in the
interim consolidated statements of changes in equity of the Company.

As stated in Note 01, the thyssenkrupp ET Group was not a legal group for consolidated financial statements
reporting purposes in accordance with IFRS 10 “Consolidated Financial Statements” until December 31, 2019.
Therefore, the equity is carried over into the capital structure of the Company on December 31, 2019 (i.e. with
finalization of the legal reorganization). The equity of the Company consists of the capital stock, the additional
paid-in capital, the retained earnings and cumulative other comprehensive income.

In the comparative period in which the Elevator Technology Business was presented on a combined basis, equity
contained the following material category in the combined statements of changes in equity:

**Invested equity attributable to the thyssenkrupp Group**

The invested equity attributable to the thyssenkrupp Group was calculated by aggregating the invested equity of
the Company, thyssenkrupp Elevator laO as well as of thyssenkrupp Elevator International Holding B.V., the
equity of their direct and indirect subsidiaries and the invested equity of the Elevator Technology Business
operating activities that were or are being conducted by direct or indirect subsidiaries of thyssenkrupp AG.

**Line item “Other transactions with the remaining thyssenkrupp Group” as presented in the interim**
**consolidated statements of changes in equity**

During the period ended March 31, 2020, other transactions with the remaining thyssenkrupp Group include
corporate cost allocations relating to central services provided by remaining thyssenkrupp Group in the amount
of €8 million (March 31, 2019: €16 million), dividend distributions to the remaining thyssenkrupp Group of
€(535) million (March 31, 2019: €(343) million), contributions and withdrawals from thyssenkrupp Group as a
result of various transactions in the amount of €(3,219) million (March 31, 2019: €0 million), effects relating to
profit and loss transfer agreements of €(7) million (March 31, 2019: €0 million), effects of combination and
carve-out adjustments related to the allocation of Elevator Technology Business net assets in the amount of
€35 million (March 31, 2019: €22 million), tax related adjustments of €96 million (March 31, 2019: €4 million),
and other adjustments of €5 million (March 31, 2019: €3 million).

The decrease in the line item “Other transactions with the remaining thyssenkrupp Group” in the amount of
€(3,319) million is mainly impacted by the finalization of the legal reorganization of the thyssenkrupp ET Group
as of December 31, 2019. The previously allocated assets and shares that had been contributed against equity in
the Combined Financial Statements as of and for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, September 30, 2018
and September 30, 2017, are legally transferred to the thyssenkrupp ET Group in the interim period ended
March 31, 2020. The consideration transferred (against purchase prices) for these share deals and asset deals
resulted in a reduction of equity. Refer to Note 11 “Related Parties” for the transfers as part of the legal
reorganization of the thyssenkrupp ET Group.

**Line item “Allocation of invested equity according to legal structure on Dec. 31, 2019”**

As of December 31, 2019, the legal reorganization was finalized and thus resulting in the necessity to present
equity based on the capital structure of thyssenkrupp Elevator AG instead of reporting invested equity. The main
effect shown in the line item “Allocation of invested equity according to legal structure on Dec. 31, 2019” is an
allocation of previously reported invested equity to capital stock, additional paid-in capital and retained earnings.
The amount of €4,522 million shown in additional paid in-capital and the amount of €500 million shown as
capital stock are mainly derived from a contribution in kind as well as a capital increase as part of the legal
reorganization. The capital increase amounts to €820 million and is shown in the additional paid-in-capital. The
shares in thyssenkrupp Elevator International Holding B.V. in the amount of €4,202 million are contributed in
kind into thyssenkrupp Elevator Holding AG and are shown in capital stock in the amount of €500 million and in
additional paid-in-capital in the amount of €3,702 million.

**Capital Management**

Capital management for the thyssenkrupp ET Group was performed by thyssenkrupp AG during the periods
under consideration.

**08 Other provisions**

The restructuring provisions included in other provisions decreased by €15 million to €67 million compared with
September 30, 2019. The additions in the amount of €14 million relate to the Europe/Africa and the Americas
business units.

In connection with the Elevator cartel, potentially injured parties have asserted claims for damages against
thyssenkrupp AG and companies of the thyssenkrupp Group in and out of court. Since September 30, 2019
further claims have been quantified in the ongoing course of the legal proceedings, which has not led to a change
in the risk assessment and recorded provisions. A majority of the proceedings have now been dealt with through
settlement, withdrawal or dismissal of the claims. Legal cases are still pending in Austria, Belgium and the
Netherlands. They are at different stages of proceedings. thyssenkrupp ET Group has recognized provisions for
the portion of the pending claims which, in its opinion, will probably result in cash outflows.

The basis for possible payments under the guarantees is the non-performance of the principal debtor under a
contractual agreement, e.g. late delivery, delivery of non-conforming goods under a contract or non-performance
with respect to the warranted quality.

All guarantees are issued by instruction of a consolidated company of the thyssenkrupp ET Group upon request
of the principal debtor obligated by the underlying contractual relationship and are subject to recourse provisions
in case of default.

**10 Financial instruments**

The carrying amounts of trade accounts receivable, other current financial assets as well as cash and cash
equivalents equal their fair values.

Equity and debt instruments are in general measured at fair value, which is based to the extent available on
market prices as of the balance sheet date. When no quoted market prices in an active market are available,
equity and debt instruments are measured by discounting future cash flows based on current market interest rates
over the remaining term of the financial instruments.

The fair value of foreign currency forward transactions is determined on the basis of the middle spot exchange
rate applicable as of the interim balance sheet date, and taking account of forward premiums or discounts arising
for the respective remaining contract term compared to the contracted forward exchange rate. Common methods
for calculating option prices are used for foreign currency options. The fair value of an option is influenced not
only by the remaining term of an option, but also by other factors, such as current amount and volatility of the
underlying exchange or base rate.

The carrying amounts of trade accounts payable and other current liabilities equal their fair values. The fair value
of fixed rate liabilities equals the present value of expected cash flows. Discounting is based on interest rates
applicable as of the balance sheet date. The carrying amounts of floating rate liabilities equal their fair values.

Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost with a carrying amount of €4,640 million as of March 31, 2020
(September 30, 2019: €2,773 million, October 1, 2018: €1,575 million) have a fair value of €4,640 million
(September 30, 2019: €2,773 million, October 1, 2018: €1,575 million) that was determined based on fair value
measurement attributable to Level 2.

As of March 31, 2020 the non-current financial debt included other loans of €3 million (September 30, 2019: €3
million).

Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value could be categorized in the following three level fair value

The fair value hierarchy reflects the significance of the inputs used to determine fair values. Financial
instruments with fair value measurement based on quoted prices in active markets are disclosed in level 1. In
level 2 determination of fair values is based on observable inputs, e.g. foreign exchange rates. Level 3 comprises
financial instruments for which the fair value measurement is based on unobservable inputs.

In the reporting period there were no reclassifications between level 1, level 2 and level 3.

The decrease in “thyssenkrupp Group financing receivables” from €2,225 million for the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2019 to €2,221 million for October 1, 2018 results from the adoption of the new accounting
standard IFRS 9 on October 1, 2018.

The net financing position of thyssenkrupp ET Group (net of “thyssenkrupp Group financing receivables” and
“thyssenkrupp Group financing liabilities, current”) decreased by €2,727 million to €(2,312) million compared to
September 30, 2019. This decrease mainly impacted by the finalization of the legal reorganization of the
thyssenkrupp ET Group as of December 31, 2019.

The previously allocated assets and shares that had been contributed against equity in the Combined Financial
Statements for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, are
legally transferred to thyssenkrupp ET Group in the interim period ended March 31, 2020. The payment of the
purchase prices for these assets and shares has been financed by the cash pooling.

Receivables or payables relating to payments from/due to the remaining thyssenkrupp Group under tax group
arrangements are presented within the line items “Receivables – miscellaneous” and “Liabilities –
miscellaneous”.

the thyssenkrupp ET Group through thyssenkrupp AG, service companies and regional holding companies. These
companies principally furnish central corporate services, such as tax and legal, IT services, corporate
communications, personnel-related services, accounting, controlling, financial services and treasury.

Until finalization of the legal reorganization such services have been reflected in form of corporate cost
allocations which amount to €16 million until December 31, 2019 (March 31, 2019: €30 million). Starting
January 1, 2020, the aforementioned services are provided as services under TSAs. As a result, no corporate cost
allocations have been recognized for periods after January 1, 2020.

For the 1st half year ended March 31, 2019, the allocation of the thyssenkrupp brand resulted in expenses of
€71 million. As of September 30, 2019 the Elevator Technology Business purchased the right to use the
thyssenkrupp brand for certain specified sectors relevant for the Elevator Technology Business for a purchase
price of €1,080 million. Based on the Executive Board’s decision to sell the entire Elevator Technology Business
the license agreement regarding the thyssenkrupp brand, entered into on September 30, 2019, was adjusted in
March 2020 via an addendum agreement. The terms of the addendum agreement become effective subject to the
condition precedent of all closing conditions of the transaction being fulfilled and will result in the repayment of
the initially agreed fully paid-up one-time fee in the amount of €1,080 million, reduced by a fixed amount of
€99 million for the use of the brand starting October 1, 2019 until closing. In addition, a fixed amount of
€74 million for the use of the brand for the period no longer than 18 months after closing was agreed.

purchase agreement (hereafter “SPA”) as of February 27, 2020, the fulfillment of the conditional IPO has lapsed,

flows from investing activities in accordance with IAS 7.16(e) “Statements of Cash Flows”, were effective

multifunctional building in Neuhausen will be transferred to the thyssenkrupp ET Group as part of the proposed
closing.

transaction on March 1, 2020 due to the sufficient certainty of a move of the headquarter location in the
beginning of next calendar year.

In total the lease modifications stated above resulted in an increase in the right-of-use assets of €11 million and a
decrease in the lease liability of €66 million. The gain resulting from the modification of the leased
multifunctional building in Neuhausen and the test tower in Rottweil recognized in profit and loss totaled to
€4 million.

**•** **General information**

**Background**

On May 21, 2019, the Supervisory Board of thyssenkrupp Aktiengesellschaft, Duisburg and Essen, Germany
(hereafter “thyssenkrupp AG”) unanimously approved the Executive Board’s plans for a fundamental strategic
realignment of the group. As part of this new strategy, the Executive Board proposed an initial public offering
(hereafter “IPO”) of thyssenkrupp Elevator Technology Business (hereafter “Elevator Technology Business”) to
the Supervisory Board. In addition to the IPO thyssenkrupp AG was also contemplating a full trade sale of the
Elevator Technology Business to potential interested parties.

On February 27, 2020, the Executive Board’s decision to sell its entire Elevator Technology Business to a
consortium led by Advent, Cinven and RAG foundation was approved by the Supervisory Board of thyssenkrupp
AG.

The Elevator Technology Business—which designs and delivers passenger transportation solutions—has been
separated from thyssenkrupp AG and its subsidiaries (hereafter “thyssenkrupp Group”). All companies making
up the Elevator Technology Business have been transferred to thyssenkrupp Elevator International Holding B.V.,
Roermond, Netherlands, or thyssenkrupp Elevator Innovation and Operations AG, Düsseldorf, Germany, which
was previously named thyssenkrupp Elevator AG until December 10, 2019 (hereafter “thyssenkrupp Elevator
IaO2”[1]). In further steps, thyssenkrupp Elevator International Holding B.V. and its subsidiaries and thyssenkrupp
Elevator laO and its subsidiaries were then transferred at December 6, 2019 and at December 31, 2019,
respectively, under a new company named thyssenkrupp Elevator Holding GmbH, Essen, Germany (formerly
thyssenkrupp Industrials GmbH, Essen, Germany, that was founded in June 2018 under the name thyssenkrupp
Carbon2Chem Management GmbH, Duisburg, Germany). As of December 31, 2019, both companies are
therefore 100%-subsidiaries of thyssenkrupp Elevator Holding GmbH, which is then the parent company of the
thyssenkrupp Elevator Technology Group (hereafter “thyssenkrupp ET Group”). On January 16, 2020, name and
legal form of thyssenkrupp Elevator Holding GmbH was changed to thyssenkrupp Elevator AG (hereafter “the
Company”[2]).

All legal entities and the Elevator Technology Business operating activities that comprise the thyssenkrupp ET
Group have been transferred to thyssenkrupp Elevator International Holding B.V. or thyssenkrupp Elevator laO,
or one of its direct or indirect subsidiaries as part of a restructuring under corporate law. Most of the German
legal entities have been transferred into thyssenkrupp laO. Most of the foreign legal entities have been transferred
into thyssenkrupp Elevator International Holding B.V. All legal entities not forming part of the thyssenkrupp ET
Group have remained in the thyssenkrupp Group (hereafter “remaining thyssenkrupp Group”). Business
operating activities attributable to the Elevator Technology Business that have not been conducted in Elevator
Technology companies, have been transferred via asset deals into Elevator Technology Business legal entities.
Operating activities attributable to the remaining thyssenkrupp Group that have been conducted in Elevator
Technology companies have been transferred to the remaining thyssenkrupp Group companies.

Due to the significant restructuring in the context of the legal reorganization, there is no historical financial
information for the thyssenkrupp ET Group for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 that
reflects the entire operating activities of the Elevator Technology Business. Prior to the legal reorganization the
Elevator Technology Business did not exist as a separate group from October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2019,
although it was under the common control of thyssenkrupp AG over that period. Therefore, combined financial
statements were prepared for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, September 30, 2018 and September 30,
2017 (hereafter “Combined Financial Statements”). The Combined Financial Statements display a combined
presentation on book value carry-over basis of IFRS group financial information of the Elevator Technology
Business, as included in the historical thyssenkrupp AG consolidated financial statements for the respective
periods. The Elevator Technology Business is defined as the future legal structure comprised of the Company,
thyssenkrupp Elevator International Holding B.V., thyssenkrupp Elevator laO and their direct and indirect
subsidiaries but also includes all Elevator Technology Business operating activities that historically were not yet

1 Until December 10, 2019, thyssenkrupp Elevator IaO refers to thyssenkrupp Elevator AG. Starting on December 10, 2019, thyssenkrupp
Elevator IaO refers to thyssenkrupp Elevator Innovation and Operations AG.

2 Until January 16, 2020, the Company refers to thyssenkrupp Elevator Holding GmbH. Starting on January 16, 2020, the Company refers
to thyssenkrupp Elevator AG.

part of these entities but, in the context of the legal reorganization, were transferred to the Company by
December 31, 2019. The operating activities attributed to the thyssenkrupp ET Group that were previously
conducted in the thyssenkrupp Group companies have been recorded at their historical amounts. This
combination of entities under common control is hence not displayed by applying the acquisition method in
accordance with IFRS 3, but by using the predecessor accounting method using book values as reported in the
historical thyssenkrupp AG consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017,
respectively. Further information on the scope and basis of preparation of the Combined Financial Statements is
presented in Note 02 and Note 03.

The Combined Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting
Standards, as endorsed by the EU (hereafter “IFRS”). The Combined Financial Statements comprise combined
statements of financial position, combined statements of profit or loss, combined statements of comprehensive
income, combined statements of cash flows, combined statements of changes in equity and notes to the
Combined Financial Statements for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017.

The Combined Financial Statements are presented in euros, with all amounts rounded to the nearest million
(million €) except when otherwise indicated; this may result in differences compared to the unrounded figures.

The Combined Financial Statements were prepared on May 29, 2020 by the Executive Board of the Company.

**Description of the Elevator Technology Business**

The employees of the Elevator Technology Business develop, manufacture, install, maintain and modernize:

 - Passenger and freight elevators;

 - Escalators and moving walks;

 - Passenger boarding bridges;

 - Stair and platform lifts.

The systems of the Elevator Technology Business transport people in many of the world’s buildings—from
major airports, train stations and shopping malls to large office towers and hotels. The Elevator Technology
Business also provides tailored service solutions.

The Elevator Technology Business has worldwide operations in a variety of legal entities as well as business
operating activities and was included in the consolidated financial statements of thyssenkrupp AG, mainly in the
reportable segment Elevator Technology.

**•** **Basis of preparation of the Combined Financial Statements**

**Compliance with IFRS**

The following Combined Financial Statements of the Elevator Technology Business were prepared in accordance
with IFRS as well as the related interpretations of the IFRS Interpretation Committee (“IFRIC”) as they are to be
applied in the EU at the end of the last reporting period presented. As the IFRS do not provide guidelines for the
preparation of combined financial statements, IAS 8 “Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and
Errors” has been used for the preparation of the Combined Financial Statements. IAS 8.12 requires the
consideration of the most recent pronouncements of other standard-setting bodies, other financial reporting
requirements and recognized industry practices.

In the Combined Financial Statements of the Elevator Technology Business presented below, the predecessor
accounting approach has been applied in accordance with the recognized industry practices rules on business
combinations under common control. The Combined Financial Statements of the Elevator Technology Business
reflect the Elevator Technology companies and the operating activities assigned to the Elevator Technology
Business as historically included in the IFRS consolidated financial statements of thyssenkrupp AG. In general,
the Elevator Technology Business applied the same accounting policies and measurement principles in preparing
the Combined Financial Statements as were used in preparing the IFRS consolidated financial statements of
thyssenkrupp AG (using the “extraction method”). This approach was adjusted with respect to transactions with
the remaining thyssenkrupp Group companies and to ensure IFRS compliance. Transactions between the
Elevator Technology Business and the remaining thyssenkrupp Group were recognized in accordance with IFRS
and classified as related party transactions as defined in IAS 24 “Related Party Disclosures”.

**Notes to the Combined Financial Statements (Continued)**

**01 Basis of preparation (Continued)**

New IFRS accounting standards were applied in the Combined Financial Statements of the Elevator Technology
Business in fiscal years from October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2019 in accordance with the same respective
dates of first-time adoption of thyssenkrupp AG.

Specifically, for IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”, thyssenkrupp AG adopted the standard in
the fiscal year beginning on October 1, 2018, by applying the full retrospective approach to initial application.
Due to the financial statements of that fiscal year for the thyssenkrupp Group only presenting one comparative
period, the cumulative transition effects were included directly in retained earnings at the start of the comparative
period on October 1, 2017. In contrast, for the Combined Financial Statements of the Elevator Technology
Business, due to the additional comparative period from October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017 presented,
according to the full retrospective approach, IFRS 15 has been applied starting as of October 1, 2016 for the
Combined Financial Statements of the Elevator Technology Business (i.e. the cumulative transition effects were
included directly in invested equity attributable to the thyssenkrupp Group at the start of the comparative period
on October 1, 2016).

The separate financial statements or reporting packages of the combined companies or operations, respectively,
were prepared as of the respective closing dates for the Combined Financial Statements. The periods for
recognizing adjusting events in the Combined Financial Statements are identical to the respective periods of the
IFRS consolidated financial statements of thyssenkrupp AG.

**Scope of combination**

Up to September 30, 2019, the Elevator Technology Business was comprised of the Company as well as Elevator
Technology legal entities and business operating activities that were conducted in other direct and indirect
subsidiaries of thyssenkrupp AG. The legal transfer of the legal entities and the Elevator Technology Business
operating activities in the context of the reorganization under corporate law that comprise the thyssenkrupp ET
Group was not completed by September 30, 2019. As a result, financial statements of the Elevator Technology
Business as of and for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 have been prepared on a
combined basis only.

The scope of combination for the Combined Financial Statements of the Elevator Technology Business for the
fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was determined on the principles of the legal
reorganization approach. This approach is based on the fact that the economic activities that form the new entity
were not managed as one division in the past, but the entities and operating activities included in the scope of
combination are legally bound together within a reorganization process. During the reporting periods of the
Combined Financial Statements, the assets and liabilities forming the reporting entity were under common
control of thyssenkrupp AG. The Combined Financial Statements have been prepared on the basis of the
extraction method from the historical consolidated financial statements of thyssenkrupp AG taking into account
the target structure of the reorganization.

The structure of the scope of combination of the Elevator Technology Business for these Combined Financial
Statements is comprised of the following:

 - The Company,

 - Legal entities that were fully dedicated to the Elevator Technology Business by virtue of their operations
and were part of the legal reorganization and were transferred to the Company by December 31, 2019,

 - Assets and liabilities as well as income and expenses of Elevator Technology Business operating activities
that were part of the legal reorganization and were transferred to the Company by December 31, 2019,

 - Joint ventures and other investments that were part of the legal reorganization and were transferred to the
Company by December 31, 2019.

If the above components were already legally transferred in the Elevator Technology Business during the
reported periods as of and for the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, these individual transfers are
already fully reflected within the equity for the respective period as of the dates of the respective individual
transfers. Businesses or individual assets or liabilities that qualify as an Elevator Technology Business operation,
that have transferred subsequently to September 30, 2019 to the Elevator Technology Business, are still included

F-43

**Notes to the Combined Financial Statements (Continued)**

**01 Basis of preparation (Continued)**

in the scope of combination with effect from October 1, 2016, in accordance with the above and below
principles. At the time of the actual respective individual transfers subsequent to September 30, 2019, the
acquisition of such business operations may decrease equity of the Elevator Technology Business if the
consideration transferred exceeds the book value of the business operations acquired.

Businesses as defined in accordance with IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” in analogy for transactions under
common control that have been transferred to the Elevator Technology Business during the legal reorganization
were included with their respective assets and liabilities as well as income and expenses in the Combined
Financial Statements for the whole of the reporting period, i.e. from October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2019.
Businesses that were acquired from a third party during the reporting periods of the Combined Financial
Statements were included from the date at which the thyssenkrupp Group gained control. Companies and
operating activities that constitute a business and that were not controlled by Elevator Technology Business
companies after the legal reorganization had been finalized, were excluded from the scope of combination for all
periods.

Assets and liabilities that do not constitute a business in accordance with IFRS 3 that were acquired or disposed
of by entities that were part of the Elevator Technology Business during the reporting periods of the Combined
Financial Statements were included in or excluded from these financial statements as of the date of the
transaction. Leased assets which will be legally transferred from the thyssenkrupp Group to the thyssenkrupp ET
Group after the closing of the transaction, remained treated as leased assets in the Combined Financial
Statements (for more details refer to Note 22).

Operating activities that represent business operations that have been transferred as part of the legal
reorganization to an existing or newly formed Elevator Technology company but historically were part of a legal
entity that has remained in the remaining thyssenkrupp Group, were included in the scope of combination for all
periods presented. These transfers to existing or newly formed Elevator Technology companies have been part of
a “linked transaction”, according to IFRS 10.B97, that was closed as of December 31, 2019. For these Elevator
Technology Business operating activities, separate IFRS financial information were prepared and appropriately
included in the Combined Financial Statements. For the purposes of the Combined Financial Statements, income,
expenses, assets and liabilities were attributed and allocated to the relevant Elevator Technology Business
operating activities. Assets and liabilities as well as income and expenses were attributed directly or, where this
was not possible, indirectly with the help of appropriate allocation keys (for example on the basis of employee
headcount or revenues), which were applied consistently during the periods under consideration.

Legal transfers to/from the Company or its direct and indirect subsidiaries during the reporting periods or after
September 30, 2019 but before or on December 31, 2019 involving shares of companies are referred to in the
following as “share deals” and the legal entities concerned as “share deal companies”.

Legal transfers to the Company or its direct and indirect subsidiaries during the reporting periods or after
September 30, 2019 but before or on December 31, 2019, that entirely relate to assets and liabilities or
obligations are referred to in the following as “asset deals” and the Elevator Technology Business operating
activities concerned as “asset deal companies”.

A full list of the companies and Elevator Technology Business operating activities included in the scope of
combination of the Combined Financial Statements is provided in Note 03 of the notes to the Combined
Financial Statements.

**Treatment of share deal companies in the Combined Financial Statements**

Separate financial statements or reporting packages were drawn up for share deal companies and are included in
the Combined Financial Statements. They also include liquidity and financial obligations as well as financial
assets or liabilities from central cash pooling agreements with the remaining thyssenkrupp Group along with the
respective interest income and expense. Any relevant income, expenses, assets and liabilities relating to business
activities initially reported in these entities but not forming part of the Elevator Technology Business were
excluded when preparing the separate financial statements or reporting packages for the Combined Financial
Statements.

**Notes to the Combined Financial Statements (Continued)**

**01 Basis of preparation (Continued)**

**Treatment of asset deal companies in the Combined Financial Statements**

For purposes of the Combined Financial Statements, the relevant income, expenses, assets and liabilities of asset
deal companies were attributed to the Elevator Technology Business. Liquid assets, financial obligations and
financial assets or liabilities from cash pooling agreements with the remaining thyssenkrupp Group were not
attributed or allocated to the Elevator Technology Business because such assets or liabilities are not legally
attributable to the Elevator Technology Business, nor do legal claims or obligations exist towards the remaining
thyssenkrupp Group in these cases. Accordingly, no interest income or expense pertaining to such items was
reflected in the combined statements of profit or loss.

The Elevator Technology Business have obtained controlling, accounting, human resources, IT and infrastructure
services from thyssenkrupp Group service companies, such as thyssenkrupp Regional Services Germany GmbH,
Essen, Germany.

In addition, holding companies such as thyssenkrupp AG have provided various central services including
governance to the Elevator Technology Business. These services were historically reported within the business
area Corporate in the thyssenkrupp Group and will either be transferred to the Elevator Technology Business as
part of the legal reorganization or will be provided as a service under transitional service agreements subsequent
to the legal reorganization.

The respective income and costs for such services, that were historically recharged to the Elevator Technology
Business, have been included in the combined statement of profit or loss at their historical amounts. Where
income and costs for such services were historically not recharged but were essential to the operational business
of the Elevator Technology Business were either directly attributed or, where this was not possible, allocated
using appropriate allocation keys and are reflected in the Combined Financial Statements at their historical cost.

Furthermore, assets or liabilities relating to administrative services, service companies or the central activities of
the holding companies pertained to the Elevator Technology Business were attributed in the Combined Financial
Statements based on the legal reorganization principle. Shared assets relating to such holding companies that did
not legally transfer to the Elevator Technology Business were not included in the combined statements of
financial position of the Elevator Technology Business. However, for such an appropriate usage charge was
reflected in the Combined Financial Statements in the reporting periods. For shared assets relating to such
holding companies that did legally transfer to the Elevator Technology Business, were included in the combined
statements of financial position of the Elevator Technology Business. The usage by the remaining thyssenkrupp
Group was accounted for by way of appropriate usage income charges to the remaining thyssenkrupp Group in
the reporting periods.

**Presentation of the Combined Financial Statements as well as combination and consolidation principles**

The transfers of businesses between the Elevator Technology Business and the remaining thyssenkrupp Group
were qualified as transactions under common control. The Elevator Technology Business applied the predecessor
accounting approach in accordance with IDW RS HFA 2 by carrying forward the historical carrying amounts
recorded by the thyssenkrupp Group.

All income, expenses, assets and liabilities that are attributable to the economic operations of the Elevator
Technology Business and that are included in the legal reorganization process are reflected in the Combined
Financial Statements of the Elevator Technology Business.

For periods within the overall reporting period from October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2019 there was no
requirement to prepare consolidated financial statements, since the Elevator Technology Business did not
constitute a legal group of entities in accordance with IFRS 10 “Consolidated Financial Statements”. As a result,
the companies or operating activities were combined. The carrying amounts of the investments and the respective
share of any parent company in the equity of its subsidiaries, which are both part of the Elevator Technology
Business were treated in accordance with the relevant IFRS requirements. Profit or loss transfers with the
remaining thyssenkrupp Group have been treated as contribution/withdrawal from/to the remaining thyssenkrupp
Group.

The Combined Financial Statements also include joint ventures accounted for using the equity method and other
investments held at historical cost. The carrying amounts of companies accounted for using the equity method

**01 Basis of preparation (Continued)**

were adjusted annually by the percentage of any changes in their equity corresponding to the Elevator
Technology Business’s percentage interests in the respective companies.

Intercompany balances and transactions within the Elevator Technology Business along with all gains and losses
from transactions within the Elevator Technology Business were eliminated for purposes of the Combined
Financial Statements.

During the preparation of the Combined Financial Statements, deferred income tax effects on carve-out entries
were recognized as set out in more detail below.

**Combined statement of cash flows**

Operating transactions of the Elevator Technology Business with the remaining thyssenkrupp Group are reported
in the cash flows from operating activities. Financing transactions (in particular cash pooling) of the Elevator
Technology Business with the remaining thyssenkrupp Group are presented in the cash flows from financing
activities (for more details see Note 31).

The advance payments made for the test tower in Rottweil, Germany, and the multifunctional building in
Neuhausen, Germany, as well as the paid one-time fee for the thyssenkrupp brand are presented in the cash flows
from investing activities (for more details see Note 22), whereas any related proceeds from loans are presented in
the cash flows from financing activities.

The transactions with the remaining thyssenkrupp Group also include cash inflows and outflows in connection
with control and profit or loss transfer agreements between the Elevator Technology Business companies and
remaining thyssenkrupp Group companies, capital contributions and transfers from reserves in connection with
the reorganization under corporate law as well as tax receivables, tax liabilities and deferred taxes presented as
contributions or withdrawals under the separate tax return approach (see the detailed explanation below).

Services recharged by the holding companies were also presented within operating cash flow in the same way as
tax charges and benefits under the separate tax return approach.

**Goodwill**

Historical goodwill arising on acquisitions within the thyssenkrupp Group was consistently allocated and
reported in the Cash Generating Units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition. The
goodwill for the Combined Financial Statements was in turn assigned to the Elevator Technology Business on
the basis of the extraction method, i.e. where it was historically allocated. Therefore, only goodwill directly
related to the Elevator Technology Business is reflected in the Combined Financial Statements.

**thyssenkrupp brand**

In the periods up to September 30, 2019, the Elevator Technology Business was using the thyssenkrupp brand
under an operating licensing model for which it incurred expenses recognized directly in profit or loss in other
expenses. As of September30, 2019, as part of the proposed IPO the Elevator Technology Business had entered
into a new license agreement with the remaining thyssenkrupp Group for the right to use the thyssenkrupp brand
for certain classified classes relevant for the Elevator Technology Business in exchange for a one-time fee and
with no other recurring expenses after September 30, 2019 (hereafter “new license agreement”). This license has
been recognized as an intangible asset with indefinite useful life in accordance with IAS 38 “Intangible Assets”
as of September 30, 2019. Historically recognized expenses for the use of the brand remain within the Combined
Financial Statements for the periods up to September 30, 2019.

Based on the Executive Board’s decision as of February 27, 2020 to sell the entire Elevator Technology Business
the above described new license agreement, entered into on September 30, 2019, was amended in March 2020
via an addendum agreement, since the governance model in the new license agreement was only suitable with an
IPO. In substance, the terms and conditions of the addendum agreement lead to a limitation of the initially agreed
indefinite useful life.

The terms of the addendum agreement become effective subject to the condition precedent of all closing
conditions of the transaction being fulfilled and will result in the repayment of the initially agreed fully paid up

F-46

**Notes to the Combined Financial Statements (Continued)**

**01 Basis of preparation (Continued)**

one-time fee in the amount of €1,080 million reduced by a fixed amount of €99 million for the use of the brand
starting October 1, 2019 until closing. In addition a fixed amount of €74 million for the use of the brand for the
period of no longer than 18 months after closing was agreed. Both, the amount receivable and the amount
payable, are due immediately prior to closing. With the signing of the addendum agreement the intangible asset
for the right of use of the thyssenkrupp brand will be classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5. The
effects of the addendum display a non-adjusting event after the reporting period presented (also refer to Note 32).

**Pensions and similar obligations**

The Combined Financial Statements include the pension obligations and plan assets directly attributable to the
Elevator Technology Business. The obligations and plan assets have been valued on the basis of expert actuarial
reports.

In the case of Elevator Technology companies (share deal companies), both active employees and retirees have
been included. In the case of operating activities to be transferred (asset deal companies), only active employees,
which have been assigned to the Elevator Technology Business in the relevant periods have been included.

The actual transfer of the employees and the associated actual transfer of their benefit entitlements may be
subject to local requirements or the consent of the employees and may, therefore, differ from the obligations
presented in the Combined Financial Statements. The transfer of the employees into Elevator Technology
companies have been completed by December 31, 2019. The associated pension obligations have been
determined on an individual basis.

Only plan assets that have been part of the Elevator Technology Business until the completion of the legal
reorganization have been included in the Combined Financial Statements.

The actuarial valuation was based on thyssenkrupp Group parameters and where necessary adjusted for Elevator
Technology Business specifics. Actuarial reports as of September 30, 2019, September 30, 2018, September 30,
2017 and October 1, 2016 under IAS 19 “Employee Benefits” were commissioned for material Elevator
Technology Business operating activities.

**Hedging**

The Elevator Technology Business uses derivative financial instruments, including foreign currency forward
contracts and foreign currency options to reduce its exposure to foreign currency risk. The Combined Financial
Statements include all hedges directly attributable to the Elevator Technology Business.

These derivatives are all entered into with counterparties within the thyssenkrupp Group. Of these derivatives,
some are designated as hedging instruments for hedge accounting purposes. All hedge documentation for this has
historically already been documented at a local level, i.e. where the hedged risk exists. As such, for the
Combined Financial Statements, all hedge accounting previously recorded can be maintained.

In the Combined Financial Statements any hedging relationships between the Elevator Technology Business and
the remaining thyssenkrupp Group will be presented and accounted for as with related parties (for more details
see Note 22).

**Share-based compensation**

Employees of the Elevator Technology Business participated in share-based compensation programs of the
thyssenkrupp Group. These are classified as cash-settled in line with the specific requirements for share-based
payment transactions among group entities. The expenses and obligations arising from share-based compensation
were historically recognized and reported in the financial statements of those companies which incurred the
personnel expenses and also settled the obligations for their employees. For more details see Note 13.

For the purposes of the Combined Financial Statements, this means that expenses were already correctly included
in the reporting financial statements of share deal companies and no changes to the classification of the programs
was necessary. For expenses and obligations related to employees that are part of the Elevator Technology
Business but that were not part of a share deal company, however, the costs and obligations were included in the
Combined Financial Statements with no changes to the classification so long as the contractual obligation to
settle the shared-based payment liability has been transferred to an Elevator Technology Business company as
part of the legal reorganization.

**Notes to the Combined Financial Statements (Continued)**

**01 Basis of preparation (Continued)**

**Capital structure**

The equity of the Elevator Technology Business consists of the invested equity attributable to the thyssenkrupp
Group, other components of equity and the invested equity attributable to non-controlling interest. The Combined
Financial Statements do not show share capital. Since the Elevator Technology Business has no share capital and
reserves in its own right, any equity represents the parent’s net investment. Thus, the presentation of the equity of
the Elevator Technology Business differs from the presentation of equity as prescribed in IAS 1 “Presentation of
Financial Statements”.

During the reporting periods under consideration of the Combined Financial Statements, the Elevator
Technology Business was mainly financed by the remaining thyssenkrupp Group. The capital structure of the
Elevator Technology Business at the time of the closing of the transaction will differ from the capital structure
presented in the Combined Financial Statements.

**Income taxes and deferred taxes**

Current and deferred income taxes are recognized in accordance with IAS 12 “Income Taxes”. For purposes of
the Combined Financial Statements, income taxes were determined using the separate tax return approach based
on the assumption that the companies and operations of the Elevator Technology Business constitute separate tax
payers. This assumption implies that current and deferred taxes for all companies (share deal companies) and
operations (asset deal companies) within Elevator Technology Business are calculated separately and that the
recoverability of deferred tax assets is assessed on this basis. Legal entities and business operating activities are
treated for purposes of the separate tax return approach as a tax group if such legal entities and business
operations have historically been included in a tax group and as of December 31, 2019 have operated under a
new tax group or are still included within the historical tax group. In such cases, the legal entity or business
operating activities representing the head of the tax group is considered as the separate tax payer.

Deferred tax assets resulting from tax loss carryforwards are recognized in the Combined Financial Statements to
the extent that it is probable that they can be offset against positive results from the respective Elevator
Technology Business companies or operations in the future. This is only applicable if the legal entity is part of
the thyssenkrupp ET Group and to the extent the legal entity has tax loss carryforwards legally assessed.

For companies or operations that did not constitute a separate tax payer in the historical reporting period
(e.g. companies being part of a fiscal unity or asset deal companies) the following particularities apply:

 - Tax expense and tax income are recognized in the Combined Financial Statements in the years in which
they arose as contributions or withdrawals by the shareholders immediately settled in equity;

 - Current losses trigger tax income, which is treated as withdrawal by the shareholders in the respective year;

 - Tax receivables, tax liabilities and deferred tax assets from current losses are not shown in the Combined
Financial Statements. US companies being part of a fiscal unity are allowed to utilize its own tax losses after
leaving the fiscal unity. Thus, for US companies deferred tax assets on tax loss carryforwards are reflected
in the Combined Financial Statements to the extent the tax loss carryforwards can be used in the future.

In the combined statements of cash flows, the taxes actually paid to tax authorities as well as current taxes
allocated based on the separate tax return approach were included as inflows/outflows from operating activities.
Taxes allocated to Elevator Technology Business under the separate tax return approach were deemed
immediately settled.

Payments made to the remaining thyssenkrupp Group under historical tax group arrangements are also included
as inflows/outflows from operating activities.

The management of the Elevator Technology Business deems this approach as appropriate but not necessarily
indicative of the tax expense or income that would result in Elevator Technology as a separate group.

**Segment reporting**

In accordance with the management approach required by IFRS 8 “Operating Segments”, the internal reporting
of the Elevator Technology Business is based on the historical internal organizational and reporting structure of

F-48

**Notes to the Combined Financial Statements (Continued)**

**01 Basis of preparation (Continued)**

the Elevator Technology Business as included in the business area Elevator Technology within the thyssenkrupp
Group, which is implemented on a regional and functional basis. This segment reporting structure is presented in
the Combined Financial Statements for each of the reporting periods under consideration (for more details see
Note 23).

**Control and profit or loss transfer agreements**

The control and profit or loss transfer agreements (Beherrschungs- und Gewinnabführungsverträge) between the
thyssenkrupp ET Group and thyssenkrupp AG as well as other thyssenkrupp Group companies have been
terminated on December 31, 2019). For the purposes of the Combined Financial Statements of the Elevator
Technology Business, receivables and liabilities to the remaining thyssenkrupp Group in connection with control
and profit or loss transfer agreements were presented as other financial assets and other financial liabilities,
respectively. The related impacts of the profit or loss transfer agreements are shown as contributions or
withdrawals from reserves by the shareholders and are included in the line item “Transactions with thyssenkrupp
Group” of the combined statement of changes in equity and the combined statement of cash flows.

**Critical accounting estimates**

The combined financial information presented here does not necessarily reflect the net assets, financial position,
results of operations and capital structure that would have occurred if the Elevator Technology Business had
existed as a separate, stand-alone group in the reporting periods under consideration. The fact that the Elevator
Technology Business did not historically exist therefore limits the validity of the combined financial information.
It also means that the combined financial information cannot be used to forecast the future development of the
operations that have been combined to form the Elevator Technology Business.

In preparing the Combined Financial Statements, additional assumptions and estimates were made, particularly
in connection with operating activities to be transferred and allocable expenses for administrative services
provided by remaining thyssenkrupp Group companies. These assumptions and estimates affect the amounts and
the reporting of recognized assets and liabilities, income and expenses and contingent liabilities. The actual
amounts may vary from these estimates.

The scope of combination includes activities relating to the Operating Unit Spanish Latin America that is
comprised of the entities listed below. Issues surrounding local bookkeeping and financial reporting processes,
led to instances of qualified, adverse or disclaimer of opinions on statutory financial information of certain of
these entities for the reporting periods presented in these Combined Financial Statements. The reporting
packages included for entities of the Operating Unit Spanish Latin America in the scope of combination were, as
a result of these issues, adjusted by management based on their current best estimate while the balance sheets for
these entities as of September 30, 2019 were completely verified and corrected accordingly by management.

As a result, the following adjustments were recognized in comparison to the initial reported financial information
(unaudited):

 - a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of €(38) million as of September 30, 2019 (2018: €(25) million;
2017: €(9) million),

 - an increase/decrease in inventories of €10 million as of September 30, 2019 (2018: €(2) million; 2017:
€0 million),

 - a decrease/increase in trade accounts receivable of €(8) million as of September 30, 2019 (2018:
€24 million; 2017: €0 million),

 - a decrease/increase in other non-financial assets of €(8) million as of September 30, 2019 (2018:
€(2) million; 2017: €9 million),

 - an increase in contract assets of €98 million as of September 30, 2019, (2018: €10 million; 2017:
€0 million),

 - a decrease/increase in current income tax assets of €(2) million as of September 30, 2019 (2018:
€10 million; 2017: €3 million),

**02 Summary of significant accounting policies**

The thyssenkrupp Elevator Technology Business applied the following material accounting policies in the fiscal
years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The following policies should be read in conjunction with
Note 01.

F-51

**Notes to the Combined Financial Statements (Continued)**

**02 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**Consolidation principles in the Combined Financial Statements**

The Combined Financial Statements include the Company, thyssenkrupp Elevator International Holding B.V.,
thyssenkrupp Elevator laO as well as Elevator Technology legal entities and the Elevator Technology Business
operating activities that have been transferred to thyssenkrupp Elevator International Holding B.V. or
thyssenkrupp Elevator laO, or one of the entities which are directly or indirectly controlled by thyssenkrupp
Elevator International Holding B.V. or thyssenkrupp Elevator laO (subsidiaries) as part of a restructuring under
corporate law. The ability to control a company in accordance with IFRS 10 results from:

 - holding power over an investee (normally achieved through a possession of more than half of the voting
rights of a company);

 - being exposed to or having rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and

 - the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor’s returns.

Capital consolidation is performed by offsetting the carrying amounts of subsidiaries against their attributable
equity. On acquisition, the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at
their fair values at the date of acquisition.

The interest of minority shareholders (non-controlling interest) is stated at the minority’s proportion of the fair
values of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognized.

All significant intercompany transactions and balances between Elevator Technology Business entities are
eliminated on consolidation.

Joint arrangements where two or more parties jointly control an activity either classify as joint operations or as
joint ventures. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Where the Elevator
Technology Business transacts with its joint operations or joint ventures, unrealized profits and losses are
eliminated to the extent of the Elevator Technology Business’s interest.

Subsidiaries and joint ventures which influence the Elevator Technology Business’s net assets, financial position
and results of operations are only immaterial. Such entities are measured at fair value or in accordance with
IAS 39 “Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement” at amortized cost when the fair value of unlisted
equity instruments cannot be reliably measured; they are presented under the “Other financial assets,
non-current” line item. Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognized as an asset and is tested for impairment
annually, or on such other occasions that events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.

Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a joint venture is included within the carrying amount of the joint venture
or the associate, respectively. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries or joint operations is presented
separately in the statement of financial position.

**Foreign currency translation**

The functional and reporting currency of the Elevator Technology Business is the euro (€). Transactions
denominated in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the
transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in such currencies are retranslated at the rates
prevailing on the balance sheet date. Profits or losses arising on exchange are included in the net profit or loss for
the period.

Financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries and financial information of Elevator Technology Business
operations included in the Combined Financial Statements of the Elevator Technology Business where the
functional currency is other than the euro are translated using their functional currency which is generally the
respective local currency. The translation is performed using the current rate method. Net exchange gains or
losses resulting from the translation of foreign financial statements are accumulated and included in equity. Such
translation differences are recognized as income or as expenses in the period in which the subsidiary is disposed
of.

Companies that manage their sales, purchases, and financing substantially not in their local currency use the
currency of their primary economic environment as their functional currency. Financial statements prepared in
local currency are translated into the functional currency using the temporal method. The resulting translation

differences are included in the combined statement of profit or loss as “Other income or expenses”. Thereafter,
the functional currency financial statements are translated into the reporting currency using the current rate
method.

The exchange rates of those currencies significant to the Elevator Technology Business have developed as

**Intangible assets**

Intangible assets with finite useful lives are capitalized at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis generally
over a period of 3 to 15 years, depending on their estimated useful lives. Useful lives are examined on an annual
basis and adjusted when applicable on a prospective basis. The amortization expense of intangible assets is
primarily included in cost of sales in the combined statement of profit or loss. Intangible assets with indefinite
useful lives are measured at cost and tested for impairment annually, or if there is an indication that their value
has declined.

Goodwill is stated at cost and tested for impairment annually or on such other occasions that events or changes in
circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. Goodwill impairment losses are included in other expenses.

**Property, plant and equipment**

Fixtures and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Capitalized
production costs for self-constructed assets include costs of material, direct labor and allocable material and
manufacturing overhead. Borrowing costs directly attributable to the production of assets that necessarily take a
substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time
as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use. Administrative costs are capitalized only if such costs
are directly related to production. Maintenance and repair costs (day-to-day servicing) are expensed as incurred.
The Elevator Technology Business recognizes in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and
equipment the cost of replacing parts and major inspection of such an item if it is probable that the future
economic benefits embodied within the item will flow to the Elevator Technology Business and the cost of the
item can be measured reliably. Where fixtures and equipment comprise of significant parts having different
useful lives those parts are depreciated separately.

Fixtures and equipment are depreciated over the customary useful life using the straight-line method. The
following useful lives are used as a basis for calculating depreciation:

**Useful lives**

**Impairment of non-financial assets**

At each balance sheet date, the Elevator Technology Business reviews the carrying amounts of its intangible
assets and property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have
suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in
order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable
amount of an individual asset, the Elevator Technology Business estimates the recoverable amount of the Cash
Generating Unit to which the asset belongs.

F-53


-----

**Notes to the Combined Financial Statements (Continued)**

**02 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

Goodwill arising on acquisition is allocated to the Cash Generating Units that are expected to benefit from the
synergies of the acquisition. Those groups of Cash Generating Units represent the lowest level within the
Elevator Technology Business at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. The
recoverable amount of the Cash Generating Unit that carries a goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of
September 30, or on such other occasions that events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be
impaired. For more details refer to Note 04.

If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the
asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized as an expense immediately.

In case of impairment losses related to Cash Generating Units that carry a goodwill the carrying amount of any
goodwill allocated to the Cash Generating Unit is reduced first. If the amount of impairment losses exceeds the
carrying amount of goodwill, the difference is generally allocated proportionally to the remaining non-current
assets of the Cash Generating Unit to reduce their carrying amounts accordingly.

Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (Cash Generating Unit) is
increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount. The revised amount cannot exceed the carrying
amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset (Cash Generating
Unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized as income immediately. However,
impairment losses of goodwill may not be reversed.

**Leases**

On initial recognition leases are classified as either finance or operating. Lease transactions whereby the Elevator
Technology Business is the lessee and bears substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an
asset are accounted for as a finance lease. Accordingly, the Elevator Technology Business capitalizes the leased
asset at the lower of the fair value or the present value of the minimum lease payments and subsequently
depreciates the leased asset over the shorter of the lease term and its useful life. In addition, the Elevator
Technology Business records a corresponding lease obligation on the statement of financial position sheet which
is subsequently settled and carried forward using the effective interest method. All other lease agreements
entered into by the Elevator Technology Business, as a lessee, are accounted for as operating leases whereby the
lease payments are expensed on a straight-line basis.

**Inventories**

Inventories are stated at the lower of acquisition/manufacturing cost or net realizable value. In general,
inventories are valued using the average cost method. Manufacturing cost includes costs of material, direct labor
and allocable material and manufacturing overhead based on normal operating capacity.

**Financial instruments**

The accounting policies for financial instruments presented below are in accordance with IAS 39 for the fiscal
years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively and in accordance with IFRS 9 for the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2019. For details regarding the changes of accounting policies for financial instruments due to the
IFRS 9 regulations see the description in the section “Recently adopted accounting standards” of this Note.

A financial instrument is any contract that at the same time gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a
financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Financial instruments are recognized as soon as the
Elevator Technology Business becomes a contracting party to the financial instrument. In cases where trade date
and settlement date do not coincide, for non-derivative financial instruments the settlement date is used for initial
recognition or derecognition, while for derivatives the trade date is used. Financial instruments stated as financial
assets or financial liabilities are generally not offset; they are only offset when an unconditional legal right to
set-off exists at that time and settlement on a net basis is intended.

**Financial assets**

In particular, financial assets include trade accounts receivable, cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial
assets, as well as equity instruments and bonds held. Financial assets are initially recognized at fair value. This

F-54


-----

**Notes to the Combined Financial Statements (Continued)**

**02 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

includes any transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets, which are not carried at
fair value through profit or loss in future periods. The fair values recognized on the statement of financial
position usually reflect the market prices of the financial assets.

**Classification and measurement of financial assets**

Trade accounts receivables are accounted for at amortized cost less valuation allowances.

Receivables that do not bear interest or bear below market interest rates and have an expected term of more than
one year are discounted with the discount subsequently amortized to interest income over the term of the
receivable.

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and demand deposits as well as financial assets that are readily
convertible to cash and which are only subject to an insignificant risk of change in value, they are measured at
amortized cost.

**Financial assets held for trading**

Derivatives that are not part of an effective hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39 must be assigned to this
category when the fair value is positive as of measurement date. Gains or losses resulting from changes in fair
value are recognized in profit or loss.

**Available-for-sale financial assets**

Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets not assigned to any of the above
categories. This category includes primarily equity and debt instruments which are in general measured at fair
value. Gains or losses resulting from the measurement of available-for-sale financial assets are recognized
directly in equity, with the exception of foreign currency conversion effects on monetary items as well as
impairment losses on monetary and non-monetary items. On disposal of these financial assets, a cumulative gain
or loss recognized directly in equity until then is recognized in profit or loss of the respective period. When the
fair value of unlisted equity instruments cannot be reliably measured, they are measured at cost.

**Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss**

The Elevator Technology Business does not use the option to categorize financial assets at fair value through
profit or loss when initially recognized.

**Impairment of financial assets**

Impairments in the form of individual allowances for doubtful accounts adequately consider default risk. When
there is objective evidence of default, the receivable concerned is derecognized. Receivables that are immaterial,
and receivables of similar default risk, are grouped together and tested collectively for impairment based on past
experience. At each balance sheet date, an assessment is made of whether there is any objective evidence that the
carrying amounts of financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss are impaired. Objective
evidence includes, for example, considerable financial difficulty of the debtor obligor, disappearance of an active
market, and significant changes in the technological, market, economic or legal environment. A significant or
prolonged decline in the fair value of an equity instrument is an objective evidence of impairment.

The impairment loss on a financial asset carried at amortized cost is measured as the difference between the
asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s
original effective interest rate. An impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss.

If in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related
objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognized, the previously recognized impairment
loss is reversed through profit or loss.

**Financial liabilities**

Financial liabilities are liabilities that must be settled in cash or other financial assets. Financial liabilities are
initially carried at fair value. This includes any transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of
financial liabilities, which are not carried at fair value through profit or loss in future periods.

F-55


-----

**Notes to the Combined Financial Statements (Continued)**

**02 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**Trade accounts payable and other non-derivative financial liabilities**

Trade accounts payable and other non-derivative financial liabilities are in general measured at amortized cost
using the effective interest method. Transaction charges, including premiums payable on redemption or
settlement, are periodically accrued using the effective interest method and increase the liabilities’ carrying
amounts unless they have already been realized in the period in which they were incurred.

**Financial liabilities carried at fair value through profit or loss**

The Elevator Technology Business does not use the option to categorize financial liabilities at fair value through
profit or loss when initially recognized.

**Financial liabilities held for trading**

Derivatives that are not part of an effective hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39 must be classified as
“held for trading” and thus carried at fair value through profit or loss.

**Derivative financial instruments**

Derivative financial instruments, mainly foreign currency forward contracts, are used to reduce the currency risk.
Such derivatives and so-called “embedded derivatives”, which are an integral part of certain contracts and must
be accounted for separately, are measured initially and subsequently at fair value. If the fair value is positive,
they are recognized as financial assets, otherwise as financial liabilities. If they do not qualify for hedge
accounting, they are recognized at fair value in profit or loss, and gains or losses due to fluctuations in fair value
are recognized immediately in profit or loss.

Hedging relationships are mainly used to hedge foreign currency risks of firm commitments, future receivables
and liabilities denominated in foreign currency. In the case of cash flow hedges, the fluctuations in fair value are
divided into an effective and an ineffective portion. The effective portion of fluctuations in fair value is
recognized initially directly in equity within cumulative other comprehensive income. Reclassification to profit
or loss takes place when the hedged item affects profit or loss. The ineffective portion of fluctuations in fair value
is recognized directly in profit or loss.

The presentation of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments in the statement of profit or loss
follows the presentation of the hedged items. For foreign currency forward contracts used to hedge sales risks,
they are presented under net sales. For hedging instruments used to hedge procurement risks, they are presented
under cost of sales, and for hedging instruments used to hedge financing risks they are presented under financial
income/expense.

More information about financial instruments is provided in Note 21.

**Income taxes**

Income taxes comprise taxes levied on taxable profit in the individual countries along with changes in deferred
tax assets and liabilities that are recognized in combined profit or loss. For purposes of the Combined Financial
Statements, income taxes were determined using the separate tax return approach on the assumption that the
companies and operations of the Elevator Technology Business constitute separate tax payers. Legal entities and
business operating activities are treated for purposes of the separate tax return approach as a tax group if such
legal entities and business operations have historically been included in a tax group and as of December 31, 2019
have operated under a new tax group or are still included within the historical tax group. In such cases, the legal
entity or business operating activities representing the head of the tax group is considered as the separate tax
payer. Income taxes are reflected at the amounts likely to be payable under the statutory regulations in force, or
already enacted in relation to future periods, at the end of the respective reporting year.

In compliance with IAS 12 “Income Taxes”, deferred taxes are recognized on temporary differences arising
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred taxes are also recognized for
tax loss carryforwards and tax credits that are likely to be usable.

Deferred tax assets relating to deductible temporary differences, tax credits and tax loss carryforwards are
recognized where it is probable that sufficient taxable income will be available within the Elevator Technology

Business in the future to enable them to be used. The assessment of their future recoverability is based on
forecast calculations of the respective Elevator entity or tax groups. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized on
temporary differences taxable in the future. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if they relate
to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Elevator Technology Business has a legally
enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities. Effects of changes in tax rates or tax
law on deferred tax assets and liabilities are generally taken into account in the period in which the changes are
enacted.

Deferred and current taxes are recognized in the combined statements of profit or loss unless they relate to items
recognized outside the combined statement of profit or loss in the combined statement of comprehensive income,
in which case they, too, are recognized in other components of equity.

**Other components of equity**

The equity line item “Other components of equity” includes changes in the equity of the Elevator Technology
Business that were not recognized in the combined statement of profit or loss of the period, except those resulting
from capital transactions with the owners. Other components of equity include foreign currency translation
adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on fair value measurement of debt instruments and on derivative
financial instruments in cash flow hedging as well as the share of the other comprehensive income of joint
ventures accounted for using the equity method. Remeasurements of pensions and similar obligations are
reported in invested equity attributable to the thyssenkrupp Group in the period that they are recognized as other
comprehensive income.

**Accrued pension and similar obligations**

The Elevator Technology Business’s net obligation for defined benefit and other postretirement benefit plans
have been calculated for each plan using the projected unit credit method as of the balance sheet date. A quarterly
valuation of pensions is performed on the basis of updated interest rates and fair values of plan assets.

As far as the fair value of plan assets related to pensions or similar obligations exceeds the corresponding
obligation, the recognition of an asset in respect to such surplus is limited. As far as in connection with plan
assets minimum funding requirements related to past service exist, an additional liability may need to be
recognized in case the economic benefit of a surplus—already taking into account the contributions to be made in
respect of the minimum funding requirements—is limited. The limit is determined by the present value of any
future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan asset (asset ceiling).

With the exception of net interest, all income and expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognized in
income/(loss) from operations. Net interest included in net periodic pension cost is recognized in net financial
income/(expense) in the Elevator Technology Business’s combined statement of profit or loss.

The Elevator Technology Business’s obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are recognized as
expense in income/(loss) from operations as incurred.

The effects of remeasurements of pensions and similar obligations are recognized in other comprehensive income
and reported in invested equity attributable to the thyssenkrupp Group. They consist of actuarial gains and losses,
the return on plan assets and changes in the effects of asset ceiling excluding amounts already included in net
interest. Deferred taxes relating to remeasurements are also recognized in other comprehensive income.

The Elevator Technology Business also maintains multi-employer plans. In principle, these multi-employer plans
contain defined benefit plans as well as defined contribution plans. With respect to defined benefit multiemployer plans these are accounted for in the same way as any other defined benefit plan in case the required
information is available. Otherwise these plans are accounted for as defined contribution plans. In particular in
the USA and in the Netherlands, there exist multi-employer defined benefit plans that are accounted for as
defined contribution plans due to the fact that the pension obligations and the plan assets cannot be assigned to
the participating employers.

**Other provisions**

Provisions are recognized when the Elevator Technology Business has a present obligation as a result of a past
event which will result in a probable outflow of economic benefits that can be reasonably estimated. The amount

**Notes to the Combined Financial Statements (Continued)**

**02 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

recognized represents best estimate of the settlement amount of the present obligation as of the balance sheet
date. Expected reimbursements of third parties are not offset but recorded as a separate asset if it is virtually
certain that the reimbursements will be received. Where the effect of the time value of money is material,
provisions are discounted using a market rate.

A provision for warranties is recognized when the underlying products or services are sold. The provision is
based on historical warranty data and a weighting of all possible outcomes against their associated probabilities.

Provisions for restructuring costs are recognized when the Elevator Technology Business has a detailed formal
plan for the restructuring and has notified the affected parties.

A provision for onerous contracts is recognized when the expected benefits to be derived by the Elevator
Technology Business from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the
contract.

**Share-based compensation**

The Elevator Technology Business has participated in management incentive plans by the thyssenkrupp Group
which grant stock rights to executive and senior employees that are exclusively settled in cash after the end of the
respective performance period. The fair value of these rights is calculated on the date of grant and on each
balance sheet date and recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of three years
with a corresponding increase in provisions. Furthermore a portion of the variable compensation was granted as
share appreciation rights to the Executive Board members of thyssenkrupp Elevator laO inclusive of fiscal year
2014/2015. For both types of compensation, the provision is remeasured at each balance sheet date and at
settlement date. Any changes in the fair value of the provision are recognized as part of income from operations.

See also information provided in Note 13.

**Revenue recognition**

Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when the included distinct performance obligations, i.e. the
distinct goods or services promised in the contract, are transferred to the customer. Transfer takes place when the
customer obtains control of the promised goods or services. This is generally the case when the customer has the
ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the transferred goods or
services. Revenue from contracts with customers corresponds to the transaction price. The transaction price
includes variable consideration only to the extent it is highly probable that actual occurrence of the variable
consideration will not result in a significant revenue reversal. Variable consideration can include for example
volume discounts, delay penalties, early completion incentives, or credits in connection with bonus agreements.
The transaction price is not adjusted for a financing component, mainly because the period between the transfer
of goods and services and the date of payment by the customer is generally less than 12 months.

Where a contract with a customer has multiple distinct performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated
to the performance obligations by reference to their relative standalone selling prices. The standalone selling
prices are determined on the basis of directly observable market prices or using recognized estimation methods.

Revenue from the sale of goods and commodities is recognized at the point in time at which control is transferred
to the customer. The time of transfer of control is determined partly on the basis of the delivery clauses agreed
with the customer.

Sales revenue from contracts with customers in the new installation and modernization business is recognized
over time by the percentage-of-completion method. The percentage of completion is as a rule determined by the
ratio of contract costs incurred up to the reporting date to the total estimated contract costs as of the reporting
date. Contract losses are recognized as expense immediately and reported in the statement of financial position
under other provisions. The recognition of revenue over time for the performance of services is generally carried
out through linear allocation of the transaction price over the service performance period.

Incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer are capitalized under non-current non-financial assets
only if they relate to contracts with an original expected duration of more than 12 months. They are amortized by
the straight-line method over the term of the contract.

**Notes to the Combined Financial Statements (Continued)**

**02 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

If the performance obligations fulfilled for the customer exceed the payments received or due from the customer,
contract assets are recognized in the statement of financial position on a net basis insofar as the right to receive
payment from the customer is still conditional. Unconditional rights to receive payment are recognized under
trade accounts receivable and from this point payment automatically becomes due with the passage of time. If the
payments received or due from the customer exceed the performance obligations fulfilled, contract liabilities are
recognized in the statement of financial position on a net basis.

**Research and development costs**

Research costs are expensed as incurred.

Development costs, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or
substantially improved products and processes, are capitalized if the product or process is technically and
commercially feasible, it is intended to complete the intangible asset, there is a market for the output of the
intangible asset, the attributable expenditure can be measured reliably, and the Elevator Technology Business has
sufficient resources to complete development. Other development costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalized
development costs of completed projects are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses.

**Segment reporting**

In accordance with the so-called management approach, segment reporting of the Elevator Technology Business
is based on the internal organizational and reporting structure. The data used to determine the internal key figures
are derived from the Combined Financial Statements under consideration of the principles stated in the basis of
preparation.

**Financial statement classification**

Certain line items on the combined statement of financial position and in the combined statement of profit or loss
have been combined. These items are disclosed separately in the notes to the Combined Financial Statements.

In general the Elevator Technology Business classifies assets and liabilities as current when they are expected to
be realized or settled within twelve months after the balance sheet date. Elevator Technology companies that
have operating cycles longer than twelve months classify assets and liabilities as current if they are expected to
be realized within the company’s normal operating cycle.

**Estimates and judgments in the application of accounting policies**

The preparation of the Elevator Technology Combined Financial Statements requires management to make
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, income and expenses. All estimates and assumptions are made to the best of management’s
knowledge and belief in order to fairly present the financial position and results of operations of the Elevator
Technology Business; they are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Accounting estimates and judgments made by management in the application of IFRS that have a significant
effect on the Combined Financial Statements are in particular relevant for the following issues:

_Business combinations_

As a result of acquisitions the Elevator Technology Business recognized goodwill in its statement of financial
position. In a business combination, all identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired are
recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair value. One of the most significant estimates relates to
the determination of the fair value of these assets and liabilities. Land, buildings and equipment are usually
independently appraised while marketable securities are valued at market price. If any intangible assets are
identified, depending on the type of intangible asset and the complexity of determining its fair value, the Elevator
Technology Business either consults with an independent external valuation expert or develops the fair value
internally, using an appropriate valuation technique which is generally based on a forecast of the total expected
future net cash flows. These evaluations are linked closely to the assumptions made by management regarding
the future performance of the assets concerned and any changes in the discount rate applied.

**Notes to the Combined Financial Statements (Continued)**

**02 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

_Recoverability of goodwill_

As stated in the accounting policy, the Elevator Technology Business tests annually and in addition if any
indicators exist, whether goodwill has suffered an impairment loss. If there is an indication, the recoverable
amount of the cash-generating unit has to be estimated which is the greater of the fair value less costs to sell and
the value in use. The determination of the value in use involves making adjustments and estimates related to the
projection and discounting of future cash flows (cf. Note 04). Although management believes the assumptions
used to calculate recoverable amounts are appropriate, any unforeseen changes in these assumptions could result
in impairment charges to goodwill which could adversely affect the future financial position and operating
results.

_Recoverability of assets_

At each balance sheet date, the Elevator Technology Business assesses whether there is any indication that the
carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment or intangible assets may be impaired. If any such
indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated. The recoverable amount is the greater of the
fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. In assessing the value in use, discounted future cash flows from
the related assets have to be determined. Estimating the discounted future cash flows involves significant
assumptions, including particularly those regarding future sale prices and sale volumes, costs and discount rates
(cf. Note 04 and 05). Although management believes that its estimates of the relevant expected useful lives, its
assumptions concerning the economic environment and developments in the industries in which the Elevator
Technology Business operates and its estimations of the discounted future cash flows are appropriate, changes in
the assumptions or circumstances could require changes in the analysis. This could lead to additional impairment
charges in the future or to reversal of impairments if the trends identified by management reverse or the
assumptions or estimates prove incorrect.

_Other provisions_

The recognition and measurement of other provisions are based on the estimation of the probability of a future
outflow of resources as well as empirical values and the circumstances known at the reporting date. This means
that the actual later outflow of resources may differ from the other provisions, cf. also the remarks under Note 15.

_Revenue recognition on construction contracts_

Certain entities and operations of the Elevator Technology Business report some of their business transactions as
construction contracts, in which revenue is recognized over time using the percentage-of-completion method.
This method requires accurate estimates of the extent of progress towards completion. Depending on the
methodology to determine contract progress, the significant estimates include total contract costs, remaining
costs to completion, total contract revenues, contract risks and other judgments. The management of the
operating companies continually reviews all estimates involved in such construction contracts and adjust them as
necessary.

The expected variable consideration amount is estimated at the inception of a contract with a customer. The
estimate is made using either the probability-weighted expected value or the most likely amount. The estimation
method giving the better forecast for the respective contract is always used. The variable consideration amount
estimated at contract inception is reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted as necessary.

In the case of contracts with customers which have multiple distinct performance obligations, the required
allocation of the transaction price to the distinct performance obligations is carried out by reference to the
relative standalone selling prices. The relative standalone selling prices used generally correspond to directly
observable market prices at which the Elevator Technology company separately sells the performance
obligations to other customers. If the standalone selling price is not directly observable, a best estimate of the
standalone selling price is made. In these cases an adjusted market assessment approach, an expected cost plus a
margin approach, or a residual approach is used.

_Income taxes_

The recognition and measurement of current and deferred tax receivables and liabilities depend on management
estimates of tax uncertainties and future business performance. This includes both the interpretation of existing

F-60


-----

**Notes to the Combined Financial Statements (Continued)**

**02 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

tax regulations and the testing of deferred tax assets for impairment. These estimates are adjusted when there is
sufficient evidence of the need for such adjustment.

_Employee benefits_

The Elevator Technology Business accounts for pension and other postretirement benefits in accordance with
actuarial valuations. These valuations rely on statistical and other factors in order to anticipate future events.
These factors include key actuarial assumptions including the discount rate, expected salary increases and
mortality rates. These actuarial assumptions may differ materially from actual developments due to changing
market and economic conditions and therefore result in a significant change in postretirement employee benefit
obligations, of equity and the related future expense. (cf. Note 14 for further information).

_Legal contingencies_

Elevator Technology companies are parties to litigations related to a number of matters as described in Note 20.
The outcome of these matters may have a material effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash
flows. Management regularly analyzes current information about these matters and provides provisions for
probable contingent losses including the estimate of legal expense to resolve the matters. For the assessments
internal and external lawyers are used. In making the decision regarding the need for loss provisions,
management considers the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a sufficiently
reliable estimate of the amount of loss. The filing of a suit or formal assertion of a claim against Elevator
Technology companies or the disclosure of any such suit or assertions, does not automatically indicate that a
provision of a loss may be appropriate.

**Recently adopted accounting standards**

In fiscal year 2018/2019 the Elevator Technology Business adopted the following standards, interpretations and
amendments to already existing standards and interpretations that, with the exemption of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15, do
not have a material impact on the Combined Financial Statements of the Elevator Technology Business:

In May 2014 the IASB issued the new standard IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. The purpose
of the new standard on revenue recognition is to bring together the large number of existing guidelines contained
in various standards and interpretations. At the same time it establishes uniform core principles to be applied to
all industries and all types of revenue transactions. In April 2016 clarifications to IFRS 15 were issued relating
mainly to the identification of separate performance obligations as well as the definition of principal and agent.
The thyssenkrupp Group adopted IFRS 15 for the 2018/2019 fiscal year beginning on October 1, 2018 (IFRS 15
effective date). The full retrospective approach to initial application was applied, i.e. the cumulative transition
effects were included directly in retained earnings at the start of the comparative period on October 1, 2017. For
the Combined Financial Statements of the Elevator Technology Business an additional comparative period from
October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017 is presented. According to the full retrospective approach, IFRS 15 was
applied starting as of October 1, 2016 for the Combined Financial Statements of the Elevator Technology
Business (i.e. the cumulative transition effects were included directly in invested equity attributable to the
thyssenkrupp Group at the start of the comparative period on October 1, 2016). With this the Elevator
Technology Business is making use of the practical expedients provided in IFRS 15. In this connection at
October 1, 2016 in particular contracts that begin and are completed within the same fiscal year or are completed
at October 1, 2016 were not restated.

The application of IFRS 15 results in contract assets, mainly relating to reclassifications of receivables from
construction contracts to the contract assets required to be presented separately under IFRS 15. Further, the
application of IFRS 15 results in contract liabilities mainly due to reclassifications from current non-financial
liabilities, which relate to reclassifications of liabilities under construction contracts and to reclassifications of
prepayments received. In addition, due prepayments not yet received in cash from customers are recognized as
contract liabilities as explicitly required by IFRS 15.

The IFRS 15 transition effects on the combined statements of financial position as of October 1, 2016,
September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2018 were analyzed. The changed recognition of due prepayments not
yet received in cash leads to an increase of trade accounts receivables and contract liabilities amounting to

**02 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

€417.7 million as of October 1, 2016, €410.3 million as of September 30, 2017 and €445.8 million as of
September 30, 2018. As of October 1, 2016, aside from the reclassifications from current non-financial assets to
contract assets and current non-financial liabilities to contract liabilities in the amount of €209.6 million and
€1,274.5 million, respectively, no further material transition effects were identified. For the combined statements
of financial position as of September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2018, the identification of such reclassification
effects was determined not to be practical.

Since the reporting entity has not previously prepared financial statements for the periods presented applying
IAS 18 and since these special purpose Combined Financial Statements present the application of IFRS 15 for all
periods presented, the Elevator Technology Business does not disclose an opening balance sheet as of October 1,
2016 and reconciliation effects on such balance sheet resulting from the adoption of IFRS 15.

In July 2014 the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”. The new standard includes
revised requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets, fundamental changes to the
regulations on the impairment of financial assets, and revised rules on hedge accounting. The Elevator
Technology Business adopts IFRS 9 in the fiscal year beginning on October 1, 2018. The option to apply the
Standard prospectively was used and accordingly no adjusted comparative information was disclosed. Resultant
transition effects are reported in invested equity attributable to the thyssenkrupp Group. The new hedge
accounting rules are also applied prospectively.

The transition effects at the date of adoption were recognized directly in equity and the comparative periods are
presented in accordance with the previous rules of IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and
Measurement”.

The effects of the transition on assets, liabilities and total equity are presented in the following two tables:

The classification and measurement of financial assets under IFRS 9 is based on the financial asset’s cash flow
characteristics and on the company’s business model for managing the financial assets.

If a debt instrument is held with the objective of collecting contractual cash flows and if the cash flows are solely
payments of principal and interest, the instrument is recognized at amortized cost. At the Elevator Technology
Business this mainly concerns trade accounts receivable, contract assets, and cash and cash equivalents.

If the cash flow conditions are met but the debt instrument is held both to collect contractual cash flows and to
sell, the instrument is measured at fair value in equity (with reclassification). At the Elevator Technology
Business this mainly concerns securities (debt instruments).

For equity instruments not held for trading, the Elevator Technology Business has consistently exercised the
option to recognize future changes in fair value in profit or loss. Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge
accounting are also recognized at fair value in profit or loss.

The adoption of IFRS 9 does not impact financial liabilities.

Under the new impairment model (expected loss model) expected losses are reported and forward-looking
information is used to a greater extent. The new impairment rules are applied to debt instruments, lease
receivables, trade accounts receivable, and contract assets recognized at amortized cost or at fair value in equity.
The expected credit loss is generally calculated by multiplying the three parameters probability of default,
carrying value of the financial asset, and loss given default.

The Elevator Technology Business applies the simplified impairment model under IFRS 9 and reports lifetime
expected losses for all trade accounts receivable and contract assets. For all other financial assets twelve-month
expected credit losses are reported. Owing to the short maturities, these generally correspond to lifetime expected
losses at the Elevator Technology Business. The Elevator Technology Business has developed the following
model to determine the expected credit loss, in particular to determine the expected default rates for trade
accounts receivable. The probability of default is determined on the basis of historical default rates taking
forward-looking information into account. Consideration is also given to the respective business model, customer
groups, and economic environment of the region. Default is generally assumed after 360 days. The expected
credit loss for other loans and receivables is determined on the basis of external credit information.

As before, financial assets are fully or partially impaired on the basis of individual allowances if it is reasonable
to assume that they can no longer be fully realized, e.g. because the due date has long passed, or owing to
insolvency or similar proceedings.

For hedge accounting the Elevator Technology Business exercised the option to apply the rules of IFRS 9
prospectively from October 1, 2018. All designated hedges existing at September 30, 2018 meet the hedge
accounting requirements of IFRS 9 and will be continued. In some cases the hedging of components is possible.
The option of initially reporting hedge costs (forward element and currency basis spread) in connection with
designated foreign currency derivatives separately as costs of hedging in other comprehensive income is used
prospectively in fiscal year 2018/2019. Reclassification to profit or loss takes place when the hedged item affects
profit or loss. This will further reduce earnings volatility in the future. The Elevator Technology Business
continues to use the spot-to-spot method to measure hedge effectiveness. At the transition date there were no
impacts in the area of hedge accounting.

Furthermore in fiscal year 2018/2019, the Elevator Technology Business adopted the following standards,
interpretations and amendments to already existing standards that do not have a material impact on the Combined
Financial Statements of the Elevator Technology Business:

 - Amendments to IFRS 2 “Share-based Payment“: “Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment
Transactions“, issued in June 2016

 - Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014-2016 Cycle, issued in December 2016

 - IFRIC 22: “Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration“, issued in December 2016

**Issued accounting standards that have not been adopted in fiscal year 2018/2019**

Adoption of the new standard IFRS 16 “Leases” issued in January 2016 is mandatory at the Elevator Technology
Business from October 1, 2019. Under the previous lease standard IAS 17 payment obligations for operating
leases are only to be disclosed in the Notes. In the future, the rights and obligations resulting from these leases
must be recognized on the statement of financial position as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities upon transfer
of control.

The Elevator Technology Business will introduce the standard using the modified retrospective approach and
apply IFRS 16 to all contracts previously identified as lease contracts under IAS 17 and IFRIC 4. When using the
modified retrospective approach, prior-year comparative figures do not need to be restated, so the transition
effects at the Elevator Technology Business will generally be stated as an adjustment to invested equity
attributable to the thyssenkrupp Group at October 1, 2019. In addition the Elevator Technology Business will
recognize the right-of-use assets in the amount of the associated lease liabilities at the date of initial application.
As a result the adoption of IFRS 16 at the Elevator Technology Business will have no effect on total equity at
October 1, 2019. The Elevator Technology Business will make use of the following practical expedients provided
by IFRS 16: For short-term leases with a term of less than twelve months (and no option to buy) and for leases of
low-value assets, no assets or liabilities will be recognized. This also applies to leases which at the date of initial
application have a remaining term of less than one year. The Elevator Technology Business will not perform
impairment testing and will instead assess the leases immediately before October 1, 2019 in accordance with
IAS 37 “Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets” to determine whether the leases are onerous
contracts.

**Notes to the Combined Financial Statements (Continued)**

**02 Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

Based on the contracts concluded at the balance sheet date, the Elevator Technology Business expects an increase
in non-current assets and financial debt and an associated increase in the balance sheet total of approx.
€0.4 billion. Related to the balance sheet total at September 30, 2019, the adoption of IFRS 16 would result in a
reduction of the equity ratio of approx. 1 percentage point.

In the combined statement of profit or loss, expense from operating leases was previously stated in the respective
functional cost types. Future minimum lease payments and the expense from operating leases in fiscal year
2018/2019 are shown in Note 20.

In fiscal year 2019/2020, EBIT is relieved immaterially and net financial income/(expense) is charged
correspondingly. This results from eliminated operating lease expenses according to IAS 17 and from the initial
recognition of depreciation of right-of-use assets from October 1, 2019 according to IFRS 16.

The changed presentation of expense from operating leases will also result in a shift from cash flows from
operating activities to cash flows from financing activities. This is because operating cash flows are no longer
impacted by lease payments, only by interest payments whereas repayments are shown in cash flows from
financing activities. In fiscal year 2019/2020 this will result in a higher double-digit million effect.

The Elevator Technology Business will recognize right-of-use assets under property, plant and equipment and
lease liabilities under financial debt on the statement of financial position.

In addition to the standard presented above in detail, the IASB has issued further interpretations and amendments
to standards and interpretations whose application is also not yet mandatory and which in part require EU
endorsement before they can be applied. Management currently assumes that the application of these standards,
interpretations and amendments will not have a material impact on the presentation of the Combined Financial
Statements:

Joint Ventures (2011)”: “Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint

Since the new acquired company joined the Elevator Technology Business effective as of July 1, 2019, it
generated sales of €8 million and net income of €1 million which are included in the combined statement of
profit or loss in the year ended September 30, 2019. If the acquisition had taken place on October 1, 2018, the
company would have contributed sales of €35 million and income before taxes of €3 million to the combined
statement of profit or loss.

In the year ended September 30, 2019, in addition to the two material acquisitions presented before the Elevator
Technology Business acquired only some smaller businesses and companies that resulted in total in a purchase
price of €4 million and refers to intangible assets.

**thyssenkrupp brand**

As of September 30, 2019 the Elevator Technology Business acquired and recognized the thyssenkrupp brand as
an intangible asset according to IAS 38 with an amount of €1,080 million.

For the assessment of whether the useful life of the brand is finite or indefinite, following factors were mainly,
but not exhaustive, considered:

 - the expected usage of the brand by the Elevator Technology Business and whether the brand could be
managed efficiently by another management team;

 - typical product life cycles for this kind of brand and estimates of useful lives of similar assets that are used
in a similar way;

 - the level of maintenance expenditure required to obtain the expected future economic benefits from the
brand and the Elevator Technology Business’s ability and intention to reach such a level;

 - the period of control over the brand and legal or similar limits on the use of the brand.

The brand is regarded as having an indefinite useful life, as based on an analysis of all of the relevant factors,
there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the asset is expected to generate net cash inflows for the
Elevator Technology Business. Therefore the brand will not be amortized. Furthermore it will be tested for
impairment in accordance with IAS 38.108 and IAS 36; for more details regarding the adjustment of the
agreement in March 2020 and the related impact refer to the disclosures in Note 32.

**Goodwill**

Goodwill (excluding goodwill of equity method investments) has been allocated to Cash Generating Units
(CGU) of all business units. The recoverable amount of each CGU is determined based on a value in use
calculation using after-tax cash flow projections based on bottom-up prepared financial budgets approved by
thyssenkrupp AG’s management covering a three-year period. The last budget year is generally used to
determine the cash flows beyond the budget period and modified to calculate the perpetuity considering
additional assumptions. A business specific, sustained growth rate is taken into account; as a rule this growth rate
amounts between 1.35% and 1.5%. The weighted average cost of capital discount rate is based on a risk-free
interest rate of 0.1% (2017/2018: 1.0%; 2016/2017: 1.25%) and a market risk premium of 6.75% (2017/2018:
6.5%; 2016/2017: 6.5%). Moreover for each CGU the beta, the cost of debt and the capital structure is derived
individually from the relevant peer group. In addition CGU specific tax rates and country risk premiums are
used. To discount cash flows after-tax discount rates are applied. Based on an iterative calculation the following
pre-tax discount rates are derived from the after-tax discount rates:

The values in use for the CGUs are determined based on both historical data and expected forecast market
performance. The values assigned to the key assumptions are generally consistent with external information
sources.

5 (2018: 5; 2017: 5) CGUs were identified in the Elevator Technology Business, of which all report goodwill.
Total goodwill amounts to €1,691 million as of September 30, 2019 (2018: €1,547 million; 2017: €1,520
million). The majority of this goodwill relates to the CGUs Americas, Europe / Africa and Asia / Pacific as

For none of the CGUs a goodwill impairment resulted from the annual impairment test because the recoverable
amount of all CGUs was higher than the respective carrying amount.

As of September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, the recoverable amount of each CGU exceeded the
carrying amount by more than 10%. Possible changes in the key valuation assumptions do not lead to
impairment.

**Impairment of other intangible assets**

Impairment losses of intangible assets other than goodwill are included in cost of sales.

**Notes to the Combined Financial Statements (Continued)**

**13 Share-based compensation**

In fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, employees of the Elevator Technology Business
participated in the share-based compensation programs of the thyssenkrupp Group. For the purposes of the
Combined Financial Statements, the expenses and obligations arising from share-based compensation were
recognized in the financial statements of those Elevator Technology Business companies which incurred the
expenses or obligations, respectively.

**Management incentive plans**

The long-term incentive plan (LTI) is a long-term oriented compensation component which issues stock rights to
eligible participants. Plan participants are Executive Board members of thyssenkrupp AG and several other
selected executive employees. As of September 30, 2019, 368,511 stock rights were issued in the 7th installment,
371,175 stock rights in the 8th installment and 535,858 stock rights in the 9th installment of the LTI
(September 30, 2018: 442,936 stock rights in the 6th installment, 421,186 stock rights in the 7th installment and
411,997 stock rights in the 8th installment; September 30, 2017: 350,779 stock rights in the 5th installment,
461,073 stock rights in the 6th installment and 431,285 stock rights in the 7th installment) for the selected
executive employees of the Elevator Technology Business.

For installments of the LTI granted inclusive of fiscal year 2013/2014 (inclusive of the 4th installment), the
number of stock rights issued based on individually fixed euro amounts will be adjusted at the end of each
three-year tkVA performance period based on the average thyssenkrupp Value Added (tkVA) over this period,
beginning October 1 of the year the stock rights were granted, compared to the average tkVA over the previous
three fiscal year period. For the installments of the LTI granted beginning with fiscal year 2014/2015 (starting
with the 5th installment) the number of stock rights issued will be adjusted at the end of the respective three-year
tkVA performance period based on the average tkVA over this period compared with a tkVA target value set in
advance. The amount of payment for an installment is calculated by multiplying the adjusted number of stock
rights by the average price of thyssenkrupp’s stock in the first three months after the end of the tkVA
performance period, with the result that the term of each installment extends over four fiscal years in total.

To determine the fair value of the stock rights used to calculate the pro-rata liability as of the balance sheet date
forward prices of the thyssenkrupp stock are calculated taking into account the existing caps. The forward
calculation is carried out for predefined periods (averaging periods) taking into account the thyssenkrupp stock
price and the euro interest rate curve as of the balance sheet date and the dividends assumed to be paid until the
maturity of the stock rights. The following assumptions were used for the determination of the fair values as of
September 30, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively:

and a payment of €16 million in total, respectively. Also in fiscal year 2018/2019 the 9th installment of the LTI
was granted to the Executive Board of thyssenkrupp AG and additional executive employees. In total in fiscal
year ended September 30, 2019 the Elevator Technology Business recorded an income of €10 million from the
incentive plans due to the decline of the stock price and the average tkVA (2018: expense of €7 million; 2017:
expense of €9 million). The liability arising from the LTI amounts to €5 million as of September 30, 2019 (2018:
€20 million; 2017: €18 million).

For fiscal years 2010/2011 until 2014/2015, for Executive Board members of thyssenkrupp Elevator IaO 20% of
the performance bonus granted for the respective fiscal year was obligatorily converted into thyssenkrupp AG
stock rights to be paid out after the expiration of three fiscal years based on the average thyssenkrupp share price
in the 4th quarter of the 3rd fiscal year. In 2018/2019 the Elevator Technology Business recorded an expense of
€0 million (2017/2018: €0 million; 2016/2017: €0.2 million) associated with this compensation component; due
the termination of the program there is no obligation as of September 30, 2019 (2018: €0.5 million; 2017:
€1.1 million). In the year ended September 30, 2019 a payment of €0.5 million occurred relating to the stock
rights granted in 2014/2015 (2018: €0.6 million; 2017: €0.7 million).

**Accrued pension liability**

The Elevator Technology Business maintains company pensions designed as defined benefit plans and defined
contribution plans in various regions of the world. Those plans either are organized on an individual basis or via
branch-wide solutions (“multi-employer plan”).

Defined contribution plans are generally funded by compulsory, contractually or voluntary granted contributions
paid into legally separated pension funds. The contributions are borne either by the employer or as a matching of
employer and employees whereby the employer has no further obligation beyond the payment of contributions
into the plan. All contributions are shown as personnel expense.

Defined benefit plans are granted under consideration of country-specific Regulation (e.g. local legislation) or on
voluntary basis. The plans are either funded via legally separated assets (“plan assets”) or directly funded by
book reserves. The book reserve set out in the statement of financial position reflects the net value (obligations or
asset) of defined benefit obligation and plan assets.

The major exposure of defined benefit plans exists in Germany, Korea, France and Switzerland which covers
91% (2018: 91%; 2017: 91%) of the total defined benefit obligation respectively 89% (2018: 88%; 2017: 88%)
of the plan assets of the Elevator Technology Business.

For historical reasons a wide variety of voluntary defined benefit pension plans (DB plans) exist in Germany
based on different risk profiles. As a rule such plans provide benefits in the event of disability and/or death or on
reaching a specified age limit. The plans are mainly based on individual or collective arrangements. In the past
the employer-funded pension plans in Germany generally offered annuity payments on defined benefits.

These defined benefit plans (including final-salary pension plans, career-average pension plans, etc.) were
established first in the far past but replaced at the turn of the millennium by contribution based pension DB plans
with a risk-optimized form of payment (lump sum, installments, or annuity with limited indexation). Particularly
for newly recruited professionals and managers, the “flexplan” was introduced at January 1, 2017 and replaced
the last open “benefits plan” at thyssenkrupp. The “flexplan” is a contribution-based pension plan with a
minimum guarantee interest of 1%.

A key element to increase employees’ share in responsibility for their company retirement benefits is salary
conversion, which is an option under all pension schemes currently open for new hires. Those plans additionally
offer employer-funded matching contributions as an incentive. With regard to the funding of the company
pension plans, particularly the “flexplan” is funded by a Contractual Trust Agreement (CTA) with a positive
effect on the external funding level.

The majority of Elevator Technology companies outside Germany also provide pension plans for their
employees. These plans are in some cases based on statutory requirements or collective agreements (e.g. Korea,
France or Switzerland), but in other cases they are provided by the companies of the Elevator Technology
Business on a voluntary basis (e.g. Brazil). The range of benefits provided under the plans differs widely
depending on local arrangements, extending from defined contribution plans to final-salary defined-benefit
schemes with annuity payment.

To safeguard the payments of benefits of DB plans, the pension plans outside Germany are funded to a much
greater extent by externally separated assets. This is due in part to legal minimum funding standards, which
require full external funding of the obligations or a financing under a capital funding system. For further
information regarding the composition and investment strategy refer to the disclosures of the plan assets.

The defined benefit plan in the USA was closed and frozen in the past right before the company entered into an
annuity purchase with an insurance company taking the obligation to pay the benefits in the future directly to the
retirees. In so far no obligations remain with the Elevator Technology company in the USA related to this defined
benefit plan any more. As a replacement the company operates defined contribution plans in accordance with the
“Internal Revenue Code 401(k)”.

Beside such 401(k) plans, the Elevator Technology companies in the USA participate in a union-organized multiemployer plan (National Elevator Industry Pension Plan—“NEIPP”) for their unionized employees on the basis
of a collective agreement. This plan is a defined benefit plan, but is accounted for as a defined contribution plan
due to insufficient information about the allocation of assets. The risks from NEIPP differ from company-specific
plans with regard to the jointly managed pension assets which can potentially also be used to cover obligations of
other participating employers. When participating plan sponsors stop making ongoing contributions, the
remaining plan sponsors collectively make up the unfunded deficit, with withdrawal from the plan regularly
requiring the payment of a withdrawal contribution in order to limit the risk for the remaining plan sponsors.

Material risks associated with the different types of pension plans include above all financial risks as well as risks
in the areas of inflation and biometrics. Inflation risks which could lead to an increase in benefit obligations exist
because some of the plans are based on (final) salary and in some cases annual pension modules are directly
linked to current salaries (defined contribution plans). To this extent a rise in salaries above the salary/career
trends assumed in the valuation of the obligation would also require a direct increase in the provisions (past
service effect in the case of (final) salary pensions) or the future service cost (defined contribution plans).

In addition, further charges could result from the need for a cost-of-living adjustment in excess of the assumed
pension trend during the pension payment phase, which would lead to an immediate increase in the provisions. A
significant number of the pension plans in Germany are required by law to provide a cost-of-living adjustment. A
cost-of-living adjustment may also be required under (collective bargaining) agreements or agreed on a
voluntary/discretionary basis.

Biometric risks can result either from early benefit claims (risk of sudden changes to the statement of financial
position after death or invalidity) or from underestimated life expectancies (longevity risk) and could likewise
result in costs to the company due to unexpected increases in provisions and early cash outflows.

Risks from changes to the discount rate are purely statement of financial position-related, i.e. the provisions are
adjusted directly against equity without affecting income. Cash outflows are not affected.

Under the pension plans in Germany, individual beneficiaries are in part counted more than once due to
entitlements under different components of the pension systems. The breakdown of total of pension plans is as
follows:

**Assumptions**

The assumptions for discount rates, the rates of compensation increase and the rates of pension progression on
which the calculation of the obligations is based were derived in accordance with standard principles and

**14 Accrued pension and similar obligations (Continued)**

established for each country as a function of their respective economic conditions. Discount rates are generally
determined based on market yields of AA-rated corporate bonds of appropriate term and currency. As of
September 30, 2019, the discount rate for pension obligations in Germany was 0.70% (2018: 1.70%; 2017:
1.90%).

The following weighted average assumptions to determine benefit obligation were applied:

Accrued pension obligations in Germany are recognized on the basis of the “2018 G tables” of Prof. Dr. Klaus
Heubeck, adapted to thyssenkrupp Group-specific circumstances. In the year ended September 30, 2018 and
2017, respectively, pension obligations in Germany were recognized on the basis of the “2005 G tables” of Prof.
Dr. Klaus Heubeck, adapted to thyssenkrupp Group-specific circumstances. The impact of adoption of the new
mortality table is presented in the table “Changes in defined benefit obligations and plan assets” in line
“Remeasurement: Actuarial (gains)/losses from changes in demographic assumptions”. In the other countries the
following biometric tables were generally used: USA: Modified version of the RP-2014 Mortality Base Table
and MP-2014 Mortality Projection Scale; Great Britain: Series Tables adjusted to the CMI2016 Model, and
Liechtenstein: BVG2015 Gen.

Alternative assumptions (in each case weighted-average rate of all domestic and foreign pension obligations)
would result in the following changes in the defined benefit obligation and the corresponding reverse changes in
equity. The table shows the effects of the change in one assumption with all other assumptions remaining
unchanged:

To test the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation due to a change in the mortality and life expectancy
assumptions, an alternative analysis was carried out on the basis of 10% lower mortality probabilities from
retirement age. For beneficiaries currently aged 63 to 65, this roughly corresponds to a one year increase in life
expectancy on entering retirement.

**Plan assets**

In the Elevator Technology Business, the majority of reported plan assets associated with the funded pension
plans sit with Elevator Technology companies in Korea and Switzerland and to a lesser extent with Elevator
Technology companies in Belgium, France, UK and some other European countries. As of the balance sheet date
the asset class “others” mainly consists of insurance contracts, insurance based pension funds or fixed income
products with less exposure directly invested in capital market products as set out below:

In general, the funding policy of thyssenkrupp AG—which is applicable for the Elevator Technology Business
for the respective periods—is to contribute amounts to the plans sufficient to meet the minimum statutory
funding requirements relevant in the country in which the plan is located. The Elevator Technology Business
may from time to time make additional contributions at its own discretion. Expected contribution of the Elevator
Technology Business in fiscal year 2019/2020 is €18 million (2018/2019: €9 million; 2017/2018: €7 million)
related to its plan assets.

**Pension benefit payments**

In fiscal year 2018/2019, pension benefit payments for plans in Germany of €7 million (2017/2018: €7 million;
2016/2017: €7 million) were mainly from provisions, and pension benefit payments for non-German plans of
€9 million (2017/2018: €5 million; 2016/2017: €4 million) were made mainly from plan assets. The estimated
future pension benefits to be paid by the Elevator Technology Business’s defined benefit pension plans are as
follows:

In the year ended September 30, 2019, the duration of defined benefit plans amounts to 16 years for Germany
(2018: 15 years; 2017: 16 years) and to 15 years (2018: 14 years; 2017: 15 years) for the other countries.

**Defined contribution plans (DC plans)**

The Elevator Technology Business also maintains domestic and foreign defined contribution plans. Amounts
contributed by the Elevator Technology Business under such plans are based upon percentage of the employees’
salary or the amount of contributions made by the employees. The total cost of pension plans accounted for as
defined contribution plans in the current fiscal year was €59 million (2018: €54 million; 2017: €54 million). In
addition, contributions paid to public/state pension insurance institutions amounted to €162 million (2018:
€186 million; 2017: €182 million).

**Multi-employer plans**

In addition to the NEIPP, some companies in a few other countries also participate in multi-employer plans (e.g.
Netherlands), although the NEIPP is by some distance the biggest plan of this kind.

Unless otherwise indicated, the assessment of risk („zone status“) under Internal Revenue Code Section 432 and
the Multi-Employer Pension Reform Act 2014 relates to the reporting dates June 30, 2017, June 30, 2018 and
June 30, 2019, respectively. The NEIPP was not in critical or endangered status on either of these dates. The zone
status is based on data provided by the NEIPP and certified by the plan actuary. The NEIPP is currently classified
as “green zone” with a funding level of at least 80%. Due to the sufficient level of funding, there has been no
need for either a financial improvement plan or a rehabilitation plan in recent years.

The Elevator Technology Business is one of the four biggest sponsors of the NEIPP, paying more than 5% of
total annual contributions to the NEIPP. For the year ended September 30, 2019, the Elevator Technology
Business paid a contribution of €87 million to the plan (2018: €79 million; 2017: €80 million). The expected
contributions for fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 are €82 million.

**Partial retirement**

In particular German companies have obligations resulting from partial retirement agreements. Under these
agreements, employees work additional time prior to retirement, which is subsequently paid for in installments
after retirement. In addition, employees receive a supplement on top of their pay. For these obligations, accruals
were recognized in accordance with IAS 19 “Employee Benefits”.

**Notes to the Combined Financial Statements (Continued)**

**15 Provisions for employee benefits and other provisions (Continued)**

are non-current. Provisions of €259 million (2018: €220 million; 2017: €223 million) have a remaining term of
more than one year.

Provisions for employee compensation and benefit costs primarily represent employment anniversary bonuses
and obligations for the management incentive plans, while social plan and related costs pertaining to personnel
related structural measures are reflected in the provision for restructuring activities. Pension related obligations
for partial retirement agreements and early retirement programs, partly resulting from restructurings, are part of
the provision for pensions and similar obligations.

Product warranties and product defects represent the Elevator Technology Business’s responsibility for the
proper functioning of the goods sold (product warranty) as well as the obligation that arise from the use of the
products sold (product defect).

Provisions for other contractual costs represent pending losses from uncompleted contracts.

The provision for restructurings consists of provisions for employee termination benefits and exit costs which
have been established by operating divisions for costs incurred in connection with activities which do not
generate any future economic benefits for the Elevator Technology Business. Restructurings are being carried out
in all business units.

Other provisions include provisions for environmental obligations and other risks from individual items not
allocable to other positions.

The following items are included in provisions for litigation risks and other risks:

**Year ended Sept. 30, 2017**

In connection with the Elevator cartel, potentially injured parties asserted claims for damages against
thyssenkrupp AG and companies of the thyssenkrupp Group in and out of court. Some of the claims have not yet
been quantified. The legal proceedings are pending in Germany, Belgium, Austria and the Netherlands and are at
various stages; in some cases proceedings have already been mutually settled, claims have been withdrawn or
were dismissed. The Elevator Technology Business has set aside provisions for those pending claims which, in
its opinion, will probably lead to cash outflows.

Provisions include retentions on insured claims of four users of the Elevator Technology Business products in the
USA requesting individual damage payments for severe injuries and—in one case—fatality.

**20 Contingencies and commitments**

**Contingencies**

Combined companies of the Elevator Technology Business have had guarantees issued in favor of customers.
The following table shows obligations under guarantees where the principal debtor is not a combined company of
the Elevator Technology Business:

**Contingencies**

**Maximum potential amount of future payments as of**
**million €** **Sept. 30, 2017** **Sept. 30, 2018** **Sept. 30, 2019**

Advance payment guarantees . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14 0 0

**Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **23** **10** **12**

The terms of these guarantees depend on the type of guarantee and may range from three months to five years
(e.g. performance guarantees).

The basis for possible payments under the guarantees is the non-performance of the principal debtor under a
contractual agreement, e.g. late delivery, delivery of non-conforming goods under a contract or non-performance
with respect to the warranted quality.

**Notes to the Combined Financial Statements (Continued)**

**20 Contingencies and commitments (Continued)**

All guarantees are issued by instruction of a combined company of the Elevator Technology Business upon
request of the principal debtor obligated by the underlying contractual relationship and are subject to recourse
provisions in case of default.

As of September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, no provisions were recognized as no claims under the
guarantees were expected.

The Elevator Technology Business has contingencies for the following material legal disputes:

**Year ended Sept. 30, 2017**

Creditors of a former owner of an acquired business in Brazil claim reversal of the acquisition in order to access
the acquired assets for satisfaction of claims against the former owner.

A Chinese customer sues the Elevator Technology Business for delays in elevator installation and claims damage
payments for increased construction cost.

South Korean employees claim adjustment of calculations of ordinary wages.

**Year ended Sept. 30, 2018**

Creditors of a former owner of an acquired business in Brazil claim reversal of the acquisition in order to access
the acquired assets for satisfaction of claims against the former owner.

**Year ended Sept. 30, 2019**

Creditors of a former owner of an acquired business in Brazil claim reversal of the acquisition in order to access
the acquired assets for satisfaction of claims against the former owner.

The Elevator Technology Business is in dispute with a French customer over liquidated damages relating to
defective products and delays.

In addition further legal and arbitration actions and official investigations and proceedings have been filed
against Elevator Technology companies or may be initiated or filed in the future. Disputes in connection with the
acquisition or disposal of companies or company units may lead to partial repayment of the purchase price or to
the payment of damages or to tax charges. Furthermore, damage claims may be payable to contractual partners,
customers, consortium partners and subcontractors under performance contracts. Predicting the progress and
results of lawsuits involves considerable difficulties and uncertainties. This means that lawsuits, official
investigations and proceedings as well as claims not disclosed separately could also individually or together with
other legal disputes, official investigations and proceedings as well as claims have a negative and also potentially
major future impact on the Elevator Technology Business’s net assets, financial position and results of operations
of the Elevator Technology Business. However, at present the Elevator Technology Business does not expect
pending lawsuits, official investigations and proceedings as well as claims not explained separately in this section
to have a major negative impact on the Elevator Technology Business’s net assets, financial position and results
of operations.

**Commitments and other contingencies**

The Elevator Technology Business is the lessee to property, plant and equipment classified as operating leases.
Rental expense amounting to €125 million (2018: €130 million; 2017: €124 million) resulting from rental

The carrying amounts of trade accounts receivable measured at amortized cost, other current receivables as well
as cash and cash equivalents equal their fair values due to the short terms. For trade accounts receivable
measured at fair value, the fair value equals the carrying amount less impairment losses recognized in other
comprehensive income.

Equity and debt instruments are in general measured at fair value, which is based to the extent available on
market prices as of the balance sheet date. When no quoted market prices in an active market are available,
equity and debt instruments are measured by discounting future cash flows based on current market interest rates
over the remaining term of the financial instruments.

The fair value of foreign currency forward transactions is determined on the basis of the middle spot exchange
rate applicable as of the balance sheet date, and taking account of forward premiums or discounts arising for the
respective remaining contract term compared to the contracted forward exchange rate. Common methods for
calculating option prices are used for foreign currency options. The fair value of an option is influenced not only
by the remaining term of an option, but also by other factors, such as current amount and volatility of the
underlying exchange or base rate.

The carrying amounts of trade accounts receivable and other current liabilities equal their fair values due to the
short remaining terms. The fair value of fixed rate long-term financial liabilities equals the present value of

amounts of floating rate liabilities approximately equal their fair values.

Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value could be categorized in the following three level fair value

The fair value hierarchy reflects the significance of the inputs used to determine fair values. Financial
instruments with fair value measurement based on quoted prices in active markets are disclosed in level 1. In
level 2 determination of fair values is based on observable inputs, e.g. foreign exchange rates. Level 3 comprises
financial instruments for which the fair value measurement is based on unobservable inputs using recognized
valuation models.

In the reporting year there were no reclassifications between level 1 and level 2.

Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost with a carrying amount of €2,773 million (2018: €1,575 million;
2017: €1,733 million) have a fair value of €2,773 million (2018: €1,575 million; 2017: €1,732 million) that was
determined based on fair value measurement attributable to level 2.

**Netting of financial assets and financial liabilities**

In general, master netting arrangements exist only for derivative financial instruments in the Elevator
Technology Business that however totally or partially do not meet the offsetting criteria under IAS 32.

In these cases a right of offsetting is enforceable only on termination of the contract on the grounds of a major
breach of contract or insolvency of one of the contractual parties. The gross amounts for these derivatives are
therefore presented separately in the statement of financial position. Potential offsetting exists in the amount of
€2 million (2018: €2 million; 2017: €2 million).

The following table shows net gains and losses from financial instruments in accordance with IAS 39 for the
fiscal years ended September 30, 2017 and 2018, respectively:

To determine expected credit losses, in particular expected default rates for trade accounts receivable, the
Elevator Technology Business has developed the following model:

The probability of default is determined on the basis of historical default rates taking into account forwardlooking information. Consideration is also given to the respective business model, customer groups and
economic environment of the region. Actual default is generally assumed after 360 days.

**Derivative financial instruments**

The Elevator Technology Business uses derivative financial instruments, including foreign currency forward
contracts and foreign currency options. Derivative financial instruments are generally used to hedge existing or
anticipated underlying transactions so as to reduce foreign currency risks. In some cases, the derivatives are
designated as hedging instruments for hedge accounting purposes.

**Derivatives that quality for hedge accounting Cash flow hedges**

Cash flow hedges are mainly used to hedge future cash flows against foreign currency risks arising from future
sales and purchase transactions as well as foreign currency risks from non-current liabilities. In the case of cash
flow hedges the earnings effect of the hedging instruments is generally shown in the same profit or loss item as
the hedged underlying transaction.

For the year ended September 30, 2019, the designated part of the hedging instrument amounting to €2 million
(2018: €2 million; 2017: €1 million) (before tax) have been recognized as unrealized gains or losses directly in
equity in other components of equity. The change of the fair value of the hedged item amounts to €2 million for
the year ended September 30, 2019. Foreign currency derivative contracts usually have maturities of twelve
months or less, but can also be up to six years in single exceptional cases.

During the current year ended September 30, 2019, €0 million (2018: €(1) million; 2017: €(1) million) of
cumulative other comprehensive income were reclassified to sales in profit or loss as a result of the underlying
transactions being realized during the year. In addition, €0 million (2018: €1 million; 2017: €(1) million) of
cumulative other comprehensive income were reclassified to decrease cost of inventories, as the hedged items were
recognized, although the underlying transaction had not yet been taken to profit or loss. This resulted in increased
expenses of €0 million. Furthermore, €0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 will impact earnings.

As of September 30, 2019, net income from the ineffective portions of derivatives classified as cash flow hedges
totaled €0 million (2018: €(1) million; 2017: €0 million).

In the subsequent fiscal year fluctuations in fair value of derivatives included in cumulative other comprehensive
income as of the reporting date is expected to impact earnings by expenses of €2 million. In the following fiscal
years, earnings are not expected to be impacted.

**Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting**

If a hedging relationship does not meet the requirements for hedge accounting in accordance with the conditions
under IFRS 9 (previous years: IAS 39) or hedge accounting is economically not reasonable, the derivative
financial instrument is recognized as a derivative that does not qualify for hedge accounting. The resulting
impact on profit or loss is shown in the table on net gains and losses from financial instruments by measurement
categories. This item also includes embedded derivatives. They exist in the Elevator Technology Business in the
way that regular supply and service transactions with suppliers and customers abroad are not concluded in the
functional currency (local currency) of either contracting parties.

**Financial risks**

Being a global business, the Elevator Technology Business is exposed to financial risks in the form of credit risks
(default risk), liquidity risks and market risks (foreign currency and interest rate risks) during the course of
ordinary activities. The aim of risk management is to limit the risks arising from operating activities and
associated financing requirements by applying selected derivate and non-derivative hedging instruments. Within
the framework of risk management, financial risks and credit risks must be avoided as far as possible,
compensated by a risk portfolio, passed on to third parties or limited (principle of risk aversion).

**Credit risk**

Credit risk (default risk) is the risk of the Elevator Technology Business incurring financial losses due to the
non-fulfillment or partial fulfillment of existing debt obligations. Credit risk management is governed by
corporate guidelines. Companies and business operating activities of the Elevator Technology Business are
required to implement credit risk management in accordance with these guidelines.

In order to minimize default risks (credit risks) from the use of financial instruments, such transactions are only
concluded with counterparties that meet our internal minimum requirements of the Elevator Technology
Business. Predominantly, the Elevator Technology Business concludes its financial instruments currently and in
the future with thyssenkrupp AG. Therefore, thyssenkrupp AG represents the main counterparty subject to credit
risk.

The Elevator Technology Business generally secures default risks with suitable advance and progress payments.
Only in seldom cases, in case that a credit risk analysis provides a higher default risk, letters of credit and
payment guarantees from banks, insurance companies and management companies are requested. In order to
minimize default risks from operating activities, the corporate guidelines provide for the assessment of default
risk based on the risk profile of the business partner using suitable internal and, where available, external
information, such as ratings and credit reports, and the estimation of a financial risk exposure of the respective
business transaction from the Elevator Technology Business perspective. The Elevator Technology Business
takes a credit decision for each business transaction with each business partner using the aforementioned
approach. Taking into account the individual characteristics of its customer structures and business models, the
Elevator Technology Business lays down clear process rules for determining which measures are to be taken in
the event of payment default in order to mitigate the maximum default risk as far as possible.

Transactions whose value exceeds specified materiality thresholds, especially in the area of major sales contracts,
also require prior approval at the different management levels inside the Elevator Technology Business. Among
other things, the amount and hedging of default risks are assessed.

**Maturity analysis**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Elevator Technology Business is unable to meet its existing or future obligations
due to insufficient availability of cash or cash equivalents.

Cash flows from derivatives are offset by cash flows from hedged underlying transactions, which have not been
considered in the analysis of maturities. If cash flows from the hedged underlying transactions were also
considered, the cash flows shown in the table would be accordingly lower.

**Sensitivity analysis**

Market risk is the risk that fair values or future cash flows of non-derivative or derivative financial instruments
will fluctuate due to changes in risk factors. Among market risks relevant to the Elevator Technology Business
are foreign currency and interest rate risks. Associated with these risks are fluctuations in income, equity and
cash flow.

The following analyses and amounts determined by means of sensitivity analyses represent hypothetical, futureoriented data that can differ from actual outcomes because of unforeseeable developments in financial markets.
Moreover, non-financial or non-quantifiable risks, such as business risks, are not considered here.

**Notes to the Combined Financial Statements (Continued)**

**21 Financial instruments (Continued)**

**Foreign currency risk exposure—Foreign currency hedging is used to fix prices on the basis of hedging rates as**
protection against any unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations in the future. Hedging periods are generally based
on the maturities of underlying transactions. Foreign currency derivative contracts usually have maturities of
twelve months or less, but can also be up to six years in single exceptional cases.

The US dollar is the only relevant risk variable for sensitivity analyses under IFRS 7, as the vast majority of
foreign currency cash flows occurs in US dollars. As hedging transactions are generally used to hedge underlying
transactions, opposite effects in underlying and hedging transactions are almost entirely offset over the total
period. Thus, the currency risk exposure described here results from hedging relationships with off-balance sheet
underlying transactions, i.e. hedges of firm commitments and forecasted sales. Based on our analysis, the US
dollar exposure as of September 30, 2019 was as follows:

If the euro had been 10% stronger against the US dollar as of September 30, 2019, the hedge reserve in equity
and fair value of hedging transactions would have been €0 million (2018: €1 million; 2017: €2 million) higher
and earnings resulting from the measurement as of the balance sheet date €2 million (2018: €2 million; 2017: €2
million) higher. If the euro had been 10% weaker against the US dollar as of September 30, 2019, the hedge
reserve in equity and fair value of hedging transactions would have been €0 million (2018: €1 million; 2017: €3
million) lower and earnings resulting from the measurement as of the balance sheet date €3 million (2018:
€2 million; 2017: €4 million) lower.

**Interest rate risk—Interest rate instruments can result in cash flow risks, opportunity effects, as well as interest**
rate risks affecting the statement of financial position and earnings. Refinancing and variable-rate financial
instruments are subject to cash flow risk which expresses the uncertainty of future interest payments. Cash flow
risk is measured by means of cash flow sensitivity. Opportunity effects arise from non-derivatives, as these are
measured at amortized cost rather than fair value, in contrast to interest derivatives. This difference, the so-called
opportunity effect, affects neither the statement of financial position nor the statement of profit or loss.
Opportunity effects and interest rate risks affecting the statement of financial position and earnings are
determined by calculating fair value sensitivity analyses and changes.

As of September 30, 2019, a +100 /(20) basis point parallel shift in yield curves is assumed for all currencies in
interest analyses. The parallel downward shift is limited to (20) basis points to account for continued low interest
rates with in part negative interest rates. Negative interest rates are included in the current analysis. The analysis
results in the opportunities (positive values) and risks (negative values) shown in the following table:

**Changes in all yield curves as of**
**Interest analysis** **Sept. 30, 2017 by** **Sept. 30, 2018 by** **Sept. 30, 2019 by**

Opportunity effects . . . . . . . . . . 1 0 1 0 1 0

If, as of September 30, 2019, all yield curves combined had been 100 basis points higher, earnings resulting from
the measurement as of the balance sheet date would be €8 million (2018: €18 million; 2017: €24 million) higher.
If, as of September 30, 2019, all yield curves combined had been 20 basis points lower, earnings resulting from
the measurement as of the balance sheet date would be €2 million (2018: €4 million; 2017: €5 million) lower.

The Elevator Technology Business is not exposed to any material commodity price risks.

The cost of such services provided by the remaining thyssenkrupp Group to the Elevator Technology Business
totaled €66 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 (2018: €71 million; 2017: €98 million).

Furthermore the allocation of the thyssenkrupp brand resulted in expenses of €142 million in the fiscal year
ended September 30, 2019 (2018: €139 million; 2017: €114 million). Effective September 30, 2019 the Elevator
Technology Business purchased the right to use the thyssenkrupp brand for certain classified sectors relevant for
the Elevator Technology Business for a purchase price of €1,080 million.

purchase agreement (hereafter “SPA”) as of February 27, 2020, the fulfillment of the conditional IPO has lapsed,
however, the parties to the SPA agreed in principle to execute the purchase of the properties in the same or a
similar manner as intended under the proposed IPO. The amendments of the contracts have yet not been signed
and will become effective before closing of the transaction. The assumed purchase prices amounting to a total of
€74 million were paid upfront in September 2019. Due to the uncertainty of the execution of the proposed IPO
and the economic substance of the payment, the purchase prices were recognized as financial assets in
accordance to IAS 32 “Financial Instruments: Presentation” and are presented in the cash flows from investing
activities in accordance with IAS 7.16(e) “Statements of Cash Flows”. With the proposed amendments of the
contracts the legal ownership of the test tower in Rottweil as well as the multifunctional building in Neuhausen

intercompany interest income. The allocations of thyssenkrupp AG include corporate costs and non-operational
effects that were historically recorded on parent company level and previously not allocated or charged to the
Elevator Technology Business.

The accounting principles for the segments are the same as those described for the Elevator Technology Business
in the summary of significant accounting principles.

Elevator Technology Business’s key earnings performance indicator is adjusted EBIT (Earnings Before Interest
and Taxes). Adjusted EBIT is calculated according to economic criteria and is independent from IFRS rules. It
provides information on the profitability of a unit and contains all elements of the income statement relating to
operating performance. This also includes items of financial income/expense that can be characterized as
operational, including income and expense from investments where there is a long-term intention to hold the
assets. It is adjusted for special items, i.e. excluding disposal losses/gains from M&A, restructuring expenses,
impairment losses/impairment reversals and other non-operating expenses and income. It is more suitable for
comparing operating performance over several periods.

Operating net working capital is the key indicator for measuring liquidity and solvency in operating activities. It
is primarily comprised of inventories, trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable and net advance
payments.

**Notes to the Combined Financial Statements (Continued)**

**32 Subsequent events (Continued)**

**Other relevant events**

 - In connection with the elevator cartel, potentially injured parties have asserted claims for damages against
thyssenkrupp AG and companies of the thyssenkrupp Group in and out of court. Since September 30, 2019
further claims have been quantified in the ongoing course of the legal proceedings, which has not led to a
change in the risk assessment and recorded provisions. A majority of the proceedings have now been dealt
with through settlement, withdrawal or dismissal of the claims. Legal cases are still pending in Austria,
Belgium and the Netherlands. They are at different stages of proceedings. thyssenkrupp has recognized
provisions for the portion of the pending claims which thyssenkrupp believes will probably result in cash
outflows.

 - The Company received €820 million from thyssenkrupp Nederland Holding B.V. as capital contribution on
December 18, 2019.

 - As of January 16, 2020, the thyssenkrupp Elevator Holding GmbH changed its legal form into a German
stock corporation and has been renamed to thyssenkrupp Elevator AG. The control and profit or loss transfer
agreements (Beherrschungs- und Gewinnabführungsverträge) between the thyssenkrupp ET Group and
thyssenkrupp AG as well as other thyssenkrupp Group companies have been terminated on December 31,
2019.

 - As of February 11, 2020, thyssenkrupp Industrials Finance Germany GmbH, Essen, Germany has been
transferred to the thyssenkrupp ET Group and as of February 18, 2020 has been merged into the Company.

 - In 2011 the state of Delaware initiated an audit of certain entities within the scope of combination to
determine their compliance with the Delaware Escheats laws, also known as abandoned and unclaimed
property laws. A provision in connection with this matter was recognized for certain legal entities within the
scope of combination. As a result of the current negotiations with the state of Delaware the related provision
was reduced by a double digit € million amount after balance sheet date. This revaluation of the provision
displays a non-adjusting event after the reporting period presented.

 - Since January 2020, there is a progressive global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in various
actions – including lockdowns – that have been taken by governments all over the world in order to contain
and to control the virus. COVID-19 impacted the markets and facilities in multiple ways, depending on the
local exposure to the virus and the measures taken by local governments:

The elevator and escalator business (segments Europe/Africa, Americas and Asia/Pacific) was affected to
varying degrees. Nevertheless, the effect of the COVID-19 was felt in all regions, leading to complete
lockdowns in some regions and milder restrictions in others. Although production came to a temporary
standstill in some countries, most of the production facilities are currently operating and in the process of
recovering. In most countries production capacities in our core factories have almost recovered to
pre-pandemic levels.

The Access Solutions business (segment Access Solutions) was affected in both business lines, Home
Solutions and Airport Solutions. Activities for Home Solutions have been operated at a lower level with
partial temporary shut downs of production facilities but are recovering constantly. The partial or complete
shutdown of most airports has led to a decrease of New Installation and Service operations due to
postponements and suspensions of some projects.

The COVID-19 pandemic is considered as a triggering event for an impairment test of goodwill per
March 31, 2020. Therefore, the operational planning of Elevator Technology was tested for validity against
the background of the COVID-19 pandemic and, in effect, the recoverability of goodwill of the Elevator
Technology Business was not classified as critical. Furthermore, other intangible assets and property, plant
and equipment were also tested for impairment per March 31, 2020 which did not result in any impairment
losses for the Elevator Technology Business. Based on the uncertain progress of the COVID-19 pandemic, it
cannot yet reasonably be predicted to what extent the pandemic will affect the future financial position and
results of operations of the Elevator Technology Business. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic the
accumulated ADJ EBIT of the Elevator Technology Business is currently slightly below the budgeted
expectations.

**32 Subsequent events (Continued)**

 - Based on the Executive Board’s decision as of February 27, 2020 to sell the entire Elevator Technology
Business the new license agreement regarding the thyssenkrupp brand, entered into on September 30, 2019,
was amended in March 2020 via an addendum agreement, since the governance model in the new license
agreement was only suitable with an IPO. In substance, the terms and conditions of the addendum
agreement lead to a limitation of the initially agreed indefinite useful life.

The terms of the addendum agreement become effective subject to the condition precedent of all closing
conditions of the transaction being fulfilled and will result in the repayment of the initially agreed fully paid
up one-time fee in the amount of €1,080 million reduced by a fixed amount of €99 million for the use of the
brand starting October 1, 2019 until closing. In addition a fixed amount of €74 million for the use of the
brand for the period of no longer than 18 months after closing was agreed. Both, the amount receivable and
the amount payable, are due immediately prior to closing. With the signing of the addendum agreement the
intangible asset for the right of use of the thyssenkrupp brand will be classified as held for sale in
accordance with IFRS 5.

 - On February 27, 2020, the Executive Board’s decision to sell its entire Elevator Technology Business to a
consortium of Advent, Cinven and the RAG foundation was approved by the Supervisory Board of
thyssenkrupp AG. The purchase price (assuming closing of the transaction at June 30, 2020) is €17.2 billion.
The purchase agreement has been signed in February 2020. The closing of the transaction is subject to
merger control approvals, although thyssenkrupp continues to expect no concerns from the responsible
authorities. Even under the circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, the closing of the transaction is
expected by the end of the current fiscal year. Thyssenkrupp AG will reinvest part of the purchase price
(€1.25 billion) in a stake in the Elevator Technology Business.

 - During the 1st half ended March 31, 2020, the Elevator Technology Business reported restructuring costs
amounting to €14 million in the business units Europe/Africa and Americas.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT**

To thyssenkrupp Elevator AG, Essen

**Qualified Opinion**

We have audited the combined financial statements which comprise the combined statements of financial
position as at 30 September 2019, 2018 and 2017, and the combined statements of profit or loss, combined
statements of comprehensive income, combined statements of cash flows and combined statements of changes in
equity for the years then ended, and notes to the combined financial statements, including a summary of
significant accounting policies (together the “Combined Financial Statements”), for the business set out in
note Note 01 Basis of preparation to the Combined Financial Statements (the “Elevator Technology Business”).

In our opinion, except for the possible effects of the matter described in the “Basis for qualified opinion” section
of our report, the accompanying Combined Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the financial
position of the Elevator Technology Business as at 30 September 2019, 2018 and 2017, and of its financial
performance and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards, as adopted by the European Union (“EU-IFRS”).

**Basis for qualified opinion**

The Elevator Technology Business includes among others certain entities located in Latin America comprising
the Operating Unit Spanish Latin America which are outlined in Note 01 Basis of preparation to the Combined
Financial Statements. These entities represent about 1.9 %, 1.6 % and 1.9 % of total sales, about 2.2 %, 2.5 %
and 1.9 % of total assets and about -5.0 %, 0.7 % and 0.8 % of total net income of the Elevator Technology
Business as of and for the years ended 30 September 2019, 2018 and 2017 respectively. Due to issues regarding
the local bookkeeping and financial reporting processes which led to qualified, adverse or disclaimer of opinions
on the financial information of these entities in several instances as at 30 September 2018 and 2017 and for the
years then ended we were not able to obtain sufficient information and evidence required to assess the existence,
completeness, valuation and cut-off of the assets and liabilities as well as the income and expense of these
subsidiaries. As a result, we were unable to determine whether any adjustments were necessary in respect of
these amounts included in the Combined Financial Statements as at 30 September 2018 and 2017 and for the
years ended 30 September 2018 and 2017. Additionally, since we were unable to determine whether the
combined statement of financial position as at 30 September 2018 give a true and fair view of the financial
position, we were consequently unable to determine whether adjustments might have been necessary in respect of
the profit for the year ended 30 September 2019 in the combined statements of profit and loss, comprehensive
income and changes in equity as well as in respect of the net cash flows reported in the combined statement of
cash flows for the year ended 30 September 2019.

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities
under those standards are further described in the “Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Combined
Financial Statements” section of our report. We are independent of the entities included in the Elevator
Technology Business in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the Combined
Financial Statements in Germany, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with
these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide
a basis for our qualified opinion.

**Emphasis of matter—Basis of accounting**

We draw attention to the fact that, as described in note Note 01 Basis of preparation to the Combined Financial
Statements, the Elevator Technology Business included in the Combined Financial Statements has not operated
as a separate stand-alone group of entities. These Combined Financial Statements are, therefore, not necessarily
indicative of results that would have occurred if the Elevator Technology Business had operated as a separate
stand-alone group of entities during the years presented or of future results of the Elevator Technology Business.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

**Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the Combined Financial**
**Statements**

Management is responsible for the preparation of Combined Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in
accordance with EU-IFRS, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the
preparation of Combined Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

F-127


-----

In preparing the Combined Financial Statements, management is responsible for assessing the ability of the
Elevator Technology Business to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the
Elevator Technology Business or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of the Elevator
Technology Business.

**Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Combined Financial Statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Combined Financial Statements as a whole
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Combined Financial Statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional
scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

 - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Combined Financial Statements, whether due to
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

 - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Elevator Technology Business’ internal control.

 - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and
related disclosures made by management.

 - Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may
cast significant doubt on the ability of the Elevator Technology Business to continue as a going concern. If
we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to
the related disclosures in the Combined Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s
report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Elevator Technology Business to cease to
continue as a going concern.

 - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Combined Financial Statements, including the
disclosures, and whether the Combined Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

 - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business
activities within the Elevator Technology Business to express an opinion on the Combined Financial
Statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit. We remain
solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we
identify during our audit.
