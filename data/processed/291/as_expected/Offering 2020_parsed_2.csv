Our actual results could differ materially from those expected in our forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the factors described in “Risk Factors.” In addition, even if our actual results are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this offering memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. For example, factors that could cause our actual results to vary from projected future results include, but are not limited to: - operating within a highly competitive industry, including the resulting pricing pressure on our business; - our ability to respond to evolving market trends with innovative products and services on competitive terms; - the outbreak of COVID-19 and its global economic impact; - our ability to adjust our personnel and production capacity in line with demand for our products and services; - the incurrence of significant costs, including from warranty and product liability claims, due to products that do not meet customer specifications or that contain defects or errors; - our ability to comply with a range of different legal and regulatory requirements worldwide, and the significant costs and liabilities which could result from non-compliance; - global and regional economic conditions; - the imposition of protectionist measures, including tariffs and other barriers to trade; - our dependence on third-party suppliers, contractors and distributors; - our ability to achieve the targeted benefits from restructuring and operational improvement measures; - project management and execution risks in connection with our New Installation business; - the price and availability of high-quality raw materials, parts and components; - unforeseen business interruptions at production facilities or other operational problems; - risks relating to public sector contracts and non-compliance with regulations on public procurement; - our failure to successfully identify, enter into or integrate acquisitions and/or successfully execute disposals; - our exposure to foreign exchange translation and transaction risks; - risks related to our international operations; - legal disputes and government proceedings in which we are currently, or in the future may be, involved; - antitrust regulation and related enforcement actions and damage claims; - the imposition of tax adjustments for greater taxation of profits by tax authorities; - transfer price risks in connection with our operating activities; - our dependence on good relationships with our employees and their trade unions as well as employee representative bodies and stakeholders; - our ability to attract, hire, train and retain experienced management and personnel; viii ----- - impairment of the value of goodwill, brand names or other intangible assets; - our substantial pension and other similar employee benefits-related obligations, including the development of these obligations and related funding requirements; - the sufficiency of our insurance coverage and increases to our insurance premiums; - our reliance on complex information technology systems and networks that are subject to the risk of disruption and security breaches; - our ability to comply with various laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, health and safety worldwide, and the significant costs and liabilities which could result from non-compliance; - our ability to comply with sanctions, anti-corruption and money-laundering laws and regulations; - the adequacy of our internal controls, procedures, compliance systems and risk management systems to prevent and discover previous or future breaches of laws and regulations and generally to manage risks; - our ability to adequately protect our intellectual property and know-how or any infringement of third-party intellectual property; - regulatory and legal risks relating to data protection; - the complexity of applicable tax laws, and changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax position; - tax risks that could arise in particular as a result of tax audits or past measures; - risks related to the Transactions, our capital structure and the Notes; and - other factors discussed under “Risk Factors.” These risks are not exhaustive. Other sections of this offering memorandum describe additional factors that could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and liquidity and developments in the markets and industries in which we operate. New risks can emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all such risks, nor can we assess the impact of all such risks on our business or the extent to which any risks, or combination of risks and other factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. We urge you to read this entire offering memorandum, including the sections entitled, “Risk Factors”, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, “Industry” and “Business” for a more complete discussion of the factors that could affect our future performance and the industry in which we operate. Any forward-looking statements are only made as at the date of this offering memorandum, and we do not intend, and do not assume any obligation, to update forward-looking statements set out in this offering memorandum. You should interpret all subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or to persons acting on our behalf as being qualified by the cautionary statements in this offering memorandum. As a result, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

Due to these issues, PwC was unable to obtain sufficient information and evidence required to assess the existence, completeness, valuation and cut-off of the xvii ----- assets and liabilities as well as the income and expense of these subsidiaries and, as a result, was unable to determine whether any adjustments might have been necessary in respect of the combined financial position as of September 30, 2018 and 2017 and the combined statements of profit and loss, comprehensive income and changes in equity or net cash flows as reported in the combined statement of cash flows for the financial years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 (see Note 1 of the Audited Combined Financial Statements). The auditor’s qualification does not pertain to the combined statement of financial position as of September 30, 2019 included in the Audited Combined Financial Statements. The independent auditor’s report also contains an emphasis of matter paragraph that the Elevator Technology Business has not operated as a separate stand-alone group of entities and that the Audited Combined Financial Statements are, therefore, not necessarily indicative of the results that would have occurred if the Elevator Technology Business had operated as a separate standalone group of entities during the years presented or for any future period. In the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements, the issues relating to the Elevator Technology Business’s Operating Unit Spanish Latin America described above still remained for the six-month period ended March 31, 2019 (see Note 1 of the other explanatory notes of the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements). For the purposes of this offering memorandum, we refer to the financial year ended September 30, 2017 as the “2016/2017 Financial Year,” the financial year ended September 30, 2018, as the “2017/2018 Financial Year” and the financial year ended September 30, 2019, as the “2018/2019 Financial Year.” After the completion of the Transaction, we expect to report our financial results and condition at the level of thyssenkrupp Elevator until September 30, 2021, and Vertical Topco III thereafter. The Financial Statements in this offering memorandum have not been adjusted to reflect the impact of any changes that might occur as a result of purchase price allocation effects to be applied as a result of the Transactions. However, Vertical Topco III will account for the Acquisition using the acquisition method in accordance with IFRS 3 “Business _Combinations” and will apply purchase price allocation effects in connection with the Transactions to their_ financial statements for accounting periods subsequent to the Acquisition Closing Date. The application of purchase accounting could result in different carrying values for existing assets and assets we may add to our balance sheet, which may include intangible assets, such as goodwill, leasehold rights and software, and different amortization and depreciation expenses. Due to these and other potential adjustments, our future financial statements could be materially different once the adjustments are made and may not be comparable to the Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. Financial data in this offering memorandum as of and for the 2016/2017, 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 Financial Years, and for the six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2020, (i) if presented as “audited,” is taken from the Audited Combined Financial Statements and (ii) if presented as “unaudited,” is taken or derived from the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements, thyssenkrupp Elevator’s accounting records or its internal management reporting systems or derived from the Audited Combined Financial Statements. In making an investment decision, investors must rely upon their own examination of our business, the terms of the Offering and the financial information presented in this offering memorandum.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655
291_2,Offering 2020.md,4,CERTAIN DEFINITIONS,4.11,Basis of Preparation,4.11.1,The Audited Combined Financial Statements,"As IFRS does not provide guidelines for the preparation of combined financial statements, the preparation of the Audited Combined Financial Statements was subject to IAS 8 “Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting _Estimates and Errors,” particularly IAS 8.12, which required management of thyssenkrupp Elevator AG to_ consider recent pronouncements of other standard-setting bodies, other financial reporting requirements and xviii ----- recognized industry practices in connection with the preparation of the Audited Combined Financial Statements. Accordingly, in preparing the Audited Combined Financial Statements, thyssenkrupp Elevator applied the predecessor accounting approach in accordance with recognized industry practices and rules on business combinations under common control. In general, thyssenkrupp Elevator used the same accounting policies and measurement principles in preparing the Audited Combined Financial Statements as were used in preparing the IFRS consolidated financial statements of thyssenkrupp AG (the “extraction method”). This approach has been adjusted with respect to transactions with thyssenkrupp Group companies and to ensure compliance with IFRS. Transactions between the Elevator Technology Business and the remaining thyssenkrupp Group were recognized in accordance with IFRS and classified as related party transactions as defined in IAS 24 “Related Party _Disclosures.”_ New IFRS accounting standards were applied in the Audited Combined Financial Statements of the Elevator Technology Business in fiscal years from October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2019, as follows: - IFRS 9 (Financial instruments) was adopted in the 2018/2019 Financial Year by opting to apply the standard prospectively (i.e., from the beginning of the 2018/2019 Financial Year) and accordingly, no adjusted comparative information was disclosed. - IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) was adopted in 2018/2019 Financial Year by applying the full retrospective approach to initial application. Due to the financial statements of that fiscal year for thyssenkrupp AG only presenting one comparative period, the cumulative transition effects were included directly in retained earnings at the start of the comparative period on October 1, 2017. In contrast, for the Audited Combined Financial Statements of the Elevator Technology Business, due to the additional comparative period from October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017 presented, according to the full retrospective approach, IFRS 15 has been applied from the beginning of the 2016/2017 Financial Year for the Audited Combined Financial Statements of the Elevator Technology Business (i.e. the cumulative transition effects were included directly in invested equity attributable to the thyssenkrupp AG at the start of the comparative period on October 1, 2016). - IFRS 16 (Leases) was adopted in the 2019/2020 Financial Year by thyssenkrupp AG by opting to apply the simplified approach of using the modified retrospective method (i.e., the cumulative transition effects are included directly in equity on October 1, 2019 and the standard is applied from the beginning of the 2019/2020 Financial Year) and no adjusted comparative information was accordingly disclosed. Additional information on the scope and basis of preparation of the Audited Combined Financial Statements and the application of significant accounting policies is presented in Note 1 “Basis of preparation” and Note 2 “Summary of significant accounting policies” to the Audited Combined Financial Statements. As a result, the Audited Combined Financial Statements included in this offering memorandum may not reflect what the results of operations, financial position and cash flows would have been had the Group operated as a separate, stand-alone business without the shared resources of thyssenkrupp AG for the periods presented, and may not be indicative of our future results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The fact that the companies and operating activities comprising the Elevator Technology Business did not historically exist as a separate group limits the validity of the combined financial information.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

In preparing the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements, thyssenkrupp Elevator applied the predecessor accounting approach in accordance with recognized industry practices and rules on business combinations under common control in line with IDW RS HFA 50 Module IFRS 3 M2 published by the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer in Deutschland e.V., IDW). In general, thyssenkrupp Elevator applied the same accounting policies and measurement principles in preparing the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements as were used in preparing the IFRS consolidated financial statements of thyssenkrupp AG (i.e., the “extraction method”). This approach has been adjusted with respect to transactions with thyssenkrupp Group companies and to ensure compliance with IFRS. Transactions between thyssenkrupp Elevator and the thyssenkrupp Group were recognized in accordance with IFRS and classified as related party transactions as defined in IAS 24 “Related Party Disclosures.” xix -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,655
291_2,Offering 2020.md,4,CERTAIN DEFINITIONS,4.11,Basis of Preparation,4.11.3,,"The preparation of the Audited Combined Financial Statements in conformity with IFRS, and the preparation of the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with IAS 34, require the use of certain critical accounting estimates. These standards also require management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant, are disclosed in the financial statements. IFRS differs in various respects from generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). The Group has not prepared a reconciliation of its financial information to U.S. GAAP or a summary of significant differences in the accounting and valuation methods of IFRS and U.S. GAAP and does not intend to do so in the future. Potential investors should therefore consult their own professional advisors for an understanding of the differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655
291_2,Offering 2020.md,4,CERTAIN DEFINITIONS,4.12,IFRS 16 (Leases),4.12.1,,"The Financial Statements are prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS. On January 13, 2016, the IASB published IFRS 16 (Leases), and the European Union adopted IFRS 16 on November 9, 2017. IFRS 16 replaced IAS 17 and the related IFRIC and SIC interpretations, and resulted in almost all leases being recognized on the balance sheet, as the distinction between operating and finance leases was eliminated. Under the new standard, the lessee recognizes an asset (the right-to-use the leased asset) and a financial liability to pay lease payments. The only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases should a company elect to apply an available practical expedient in order to reduce the transition effort. IFRS 16 became effective for fiscal years commencing on or after January 1, 2019. The Group adopted IFRS 16 (Leases) on October 1, 2019, by opting to apply the simplified approach of using the modified retrospective method, which means that the cumulative transition effects are included directly in equity on October 1, 2019, and the standard is applied from the beginning of the 2019/2020 Financial Year. Accordingly, no adjusted comparative information was disclosed. Unless otherwise indicated, operating and financial information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020, represents the mathematical calculation of adding the financial information for the six months ended March 31, 2020 (as derived from the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements) to the difference between the financial information for the year ended September 30, 2019 (as derived from the Audited Combined Financial Statements), and the six months ended March 31, 2019 (as derived from the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements), without accounting for differences in the application of accounting measures. The financial information of the Group as of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020 includes the six month period ended March 31, 2020, in which IFRS 16 was adopted for the first-time and also includes the calculated six month period from April 1, 2019 to September 30, 2019, for which leases were accounted for in accordance with IAS 17 and the related IFRIC and SIC interpretations, as described above. The first-time adoption of IFRS 16 had significant impact on certain balance sheet and income statement items, as described above and also in Note 1 in the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. For that reason, the financial information as of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020, is limited in its meaningfulness. The transition to IFRS 16 on October 1, 2019, gave rise to changes to our assets and liabilities. As a result, figures as of and for the six months ended March 31, 2020, may not be comparable to the results presented for prior periods. As of March 31, 2020, our right-of-use assets amounted to €397 million and lease liabilities amounted to €330 million. The depreciation of right-of-use assets for the six months ended March 31, 2020, amounted to €49 million and the interest expense from lease liabilities amounted to €8 million. For an analysis of the impact of the first-time application of IFRS 16 (Leases) from October 1, 2019, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting _Comparability of Our Financial Statements—Changes to Accounting Standards—IFRS 16” and the Notes to the_ Audited Combined Financial Statements.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

The financial information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020 constitutes a Non-GAAP Measure (as defined below), has not been audited or reviewed by our auditors, is not required by or presented in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles and has been prepared for illustrative purpose only. This information is not necessarily representative of our results of operations for such period or any future period or any financial position at any past or future date. There are certain key differences between the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and the Audited Combined Financial Statements, which limit the comparability and meaningfulness of the financial information of the Group for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020. These include the following: - The six month period ended March 31, 2020, accounts for leases under IFRS 16, which was adopted for the first beginning on October 1, 2019. The calculated six month period from April 1, 2019 to September 30, 2019, on the other hand, accounts for leases in accordance with IAS 17 and the related IFRIC and SIC interpretations, as described under “—IFRS 16 (Leases)”. The first-time adoption of IFRS 16 had significant impact on certain balance sheet and income statement items, as described under “—IFRS 16 (Leases)” and also in Note 1 in the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements; - The six month period ended March 31, 2020 includes (i) costs for corporate services provided to the Target by thyssenkrupp AG through a combination of direct service agreements and transitional service agreements from the period from January 1, 2020 to March 31, 2020, which were entered into with effect from January 1, 2020 as part of the carve-out of the Elevator Technology Business from the thyssenkrupp Group and (ii) central cost allocations from thyssenkrupp AG from the period from October 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019, which were allocated in accordance with carve-out accounting principles and represent a proportionate amount of corporate costs and non-operational effects that were historically recorded at the parent company level without being recharged to the Elevator Technology Business. The calculated six month period from April 1, 2019 to September 30, 2019 also includes central cost allocations from thyssenkrupp AG, which were allocated in accordance with carve-out accounting principles and represent a proportionate amount of corporate costs and non-operational effects that were historically recorded at the parent company level without being recharged to the Elevator Technology Business. For more information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key _Factors Affecting our Results of Operations—Corporate Cost Allocations”;_ - The six month period ended March 31, 2020 accounts for the use of the “thyssenkrupp” brand as an intangible asset with indefinite useful life in accordance with IAS 38 (Intangible Assets), on the payment of a one-time fee under a license agreement dated September 25, 2019 entered into between thyssenkrupp Elevator Innovation and thyssenkrupp AG. In connection with the Acquisition, the License Agreement was amended in March 2020, resulting in the intangible asset for the right of use of the “thyssenkrupp” brand to be classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 in the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. See “Certain _Relationships_ _and_ _Related_ _Party_ _Transactions—Relationships_ _with_ _the _thyssenkrupp Group in the Past—License Agreement”. The calculated six month period from April 1, 2019_ to September 30, 2019, on the other hand, accounted for the use of the “thyssenkrupp” brand under an operating licensing model, as an expense recognized under “other expenses” in its profit or loss statement.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655
291_2,Offering 2020.md,4,CERTAIN DEFINITIONS,4.15,Non-GAAP Financial Measures,4.15.1,General,"In this offering memorandum, we present certain financial measures that are not recognized by IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles and that may not be permitted to appear on the face of the Financial Statements or footnotes thereto. The primary non-GAAP financial measures used in this offering memorandum include Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBIT margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, business cash xxi ----- flow (post-restructuring), business cash flow (pre-restructuring), capital expenditures, cash conversion, EBIT, EBIT margin, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, free cash flow, Lease Adjusted EBITDA, operating net working capital, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and other figures for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020 (our “Non-GAAP Measures”). Each of the EBITDA-based and net income-based measures presented in this offering memorandum is defined and calculated differently from the definition of “Consolidated Net Income” and “Consolidated EBITDA” presented in the Indentures. Our primary Non-GAAP Measures are defined as follows: - “Adjusted EBIT” is defined as EBIT as adjusted for certain special items, including restructuring expenses, impairment charges/reversals and other non-operating expenses and income; - “Adjusted EBIT margin” is defined as Adjusted EBIT divided by sales; - “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as Adjusted EBIT as adjusted further by adding back depreciation and amortization expense; - “Adjusted EBITDA margin” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by sales; - “business cash flow (post-restructuring)” is defined as business cash flow (pre-restructuring) after restructuring payments; - “business cash flow (pre-restructuring)” is defined as free cash flow before restructuring payments, major M&A transaction payments, payments for the “thyssenkrupp” brand, income taxes paid, payments made to the remaining thyssenkrupp Group under tax group arrangements and net of interest received/paid; - “capital expenditures” is defined as the sum of purchase of investments accounted for using the equity method and non-current financial assets, expenditures for acquisitions of consolidated companies net of cash acquired, capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment (inclusive of advance payments), expenditures for acquisitions of shares in the Group from thyssenkrupp Group, cash advances and loans classified as investing activities and capital expenditures for intangible assets (inclusive of advance payments); - “cash conversion” is defined as business cash flow (pre-restructuring) divided by Adjusted EBIT; - “EBIT” is defined as income/(loss) before tax, finance income, finance expense and “thyssenkrupp” brand charges but including certain finance expenses and finance income assigned to EBIT based on the economic classification; - “EBIT margin” is defined as EBIT divided by sales; - “EBITDA” is defined as EBIT before depreciation and amortization expense; - “EBITDA margin” is defined as EBITDA divided by sales; - “free cash flow” is defined as operating cash flows less cash flows from investing activities; - “Lease Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as adjusted further for the estimated effect of our adoption of IFRS 16 as if it had been adopted at the beginning of each period presented. While calculating the Lease Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020, in a first step we excluded the rental expenses resulting from operating leases in accordance with IAS17 for the six month period between April 1, 2019 to September 30, 2019. In a second step we doubled the values for lease expense that were recorded in connection with short-term leases, leases for low value assets and expenses for variable payments for the six month period from October 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020, which were recognized in accordance with IFRS16; - “operating net working capital” is defined as total assets less total non-current assets less current financial and non-financial assets less current income taxes less cash and cash equivalents plus advance payments to suppliers of inventories and to other current non-financial assets less trade accounts payable and contract liabilities; and - “Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as Lease Adjusted EBITDA adjusted further for certain cost savings adjustments. These measures are presented in this offering memorandum because they are measures our management used to assess operating performance, and we believe that they and similar measures are widely used in our industry as a means of evaluating a company’s operating performance and financing structure, and because we believe they present helpful comparisons of financial performance between periods by excluding the distorting effect of certain non-recurring items. xxii ----- Our Non-GAAP Measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS, U.S. GAAP, German GAAP or any other generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as alternatives to performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS, U.S. GAAP, German GAAP or any other generally accepted accounting principles. Our Non-GAAP Measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. Some of the limitations of Non-GAAP Measures are that: - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital investments or contractual commitments; - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - they do not reflect the significant interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; - they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay; - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our consolidated income statement; - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; - assets are depreciated or amortized over differing estimated useful lives and often have to be replaced in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and - other companies in our industry and analysts may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, our Non-GAAP Measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on the Financial Statements and using these Non-GAAP Measures only to supplement evaluation of our performance.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

291_2,Offering 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Competitive Strengths,9.3.2,Highly resilient business model across cycles through service focused-business and balanced global footprint,"We have developed a business model that we believe is stable, balanced and resilient through economic cycles, and therefore, well-positioned for sustainable, long-term value generation, as demonstrated by our strong longterm historical growth. We have delivered resilient sales and Adjusted EBIT margins since the 2007/2008 Financial Year. Despite negative currency effects in recent financial years, our sales have increased from €7,674 million in the 2016/2017 Financial Year to €8,048 million in the twelve months ended March 31, 2020, highlighting the stability of our business and our ability to maintain our sales and profitability over the economic cycle despite external pressures. The main driver of the resilience and stability of our overall business is the life cycle of our business model. Our New Installation business is a key driver of our growing installed base and units under maintenance and therefore 3 ----- is the entry gate to our Service and Modernization business. The Service business generates revenue streams that include fees for regular maintenance and income from repairs and spare parts. The strong profitability and the asset-light character of our Service business contribute to our high cash generation. For the 2016/2017, 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 Financial Years, 70% to 80% of our New Installation units converted into Service units. In each of the 2016/2017, 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 Financial Years, the Service business maintained a global retention rate of over 90%. Many of our Service business customers eventually become customers of our Modernization business, which offers us the opportunity to generate revenue from retrofitting or replacing entire systems of elevators and escalators while continuing the customer relationship. In addition, we attract many Service customers whose elevator and escalator systems were manufactured and installed by third parties, adding to our steady Service and Modernization revenue streams. The high resilience of our business is also driven by a diversified customer base with long-term contracts and high customer retention rates and a balanced global footprint, minimizing both customer and geographic concentration risks. Our top ten customers accounted for less than 3% of sales in each of the 2016/2017, 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 Financial Years. Geographically, our elevator and escalator operations (including manufacturing facilities, service centers and employees) are divided across three Operating Segments: the Americas, Europe/Africa and Asia/Pacific, which accounted for 41%, 26% and 28% of our Operating Segment’s total sales, respectively, in the twelve months ended March 31, 2020. Our fourth Operating Segment, the Access Solutions division, operates globally and generated 5% of our Operating Segments’ total sales for the same period. The resilience of our business model is demonstrated by our financial performance during periods of worldwide economic distress. For example, during the global financial crisis, our total Adjusted EBIT margin and sales remained stable between the 2008/2009 Financial Year and the 2009/2010 Financial Year. Most recently, we have been able to successfully manage and limit the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business by having immediately implemented contingency measures, which we believe further proves the resilience of our business model through the economic cycles.

291_2,Offering 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Competitive Strengths,9.3.3,Highly attractive industry with structural growth drivers,"We operate in the global elevator and escalator market, which generated sales of €55.8 billion in 2019 worldwide (excluding Japan). The global elevator and escalator market grew at a CAGR of 1.7% between 2014 and 2019, and prior to taking into account the impact of COVID-19, was expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.3% between 2019 and 2024, above expected real GDP growth. Specifically, between 2019 and 2024, the new installation, service and modernization businesses were expected to grow at a CAGR of 1.7%, 3.9% and 6.9%, respectively. This growth is underpinned by structural factors and megatrends, including increasing urbanization, an aging population, a supportive regulatory environment and sustainability and digitalization trends. Increasing urbanization is one of the primary drivers for the need for more urban spaces worldwide, which increases demand for elevators and escalators, as they are an inherent component of the residential and commercial multi-story buildings that characterize urban environments. By 2050, the number of urban inhabitants is expected to increase by 55%, from approximately four billion today to nearly seven billion. In particular, the urban population is expected to increase in emerging markets, including from approximately 60% in 2018 to 80% in 2050 in China. This trend positively affects the growth of the elevator and escalator market, as urban residents increasingly demand the access and convenience provided by elevators and escalators, particularly in cities in the developed world where large-scale urban living and infrastructure projects (such as hospitals, shopping malls and train stations) are increasingly required to offer fast and efficient urban mobility solutions. Growth in the elevator and escalator market is also driven by an increasingly aging population. The ratio of people over the age of 65 years to those under the age of five years is expected to rise from approximately 1:1 in 2019 to 2:1 in 2050. This trend is likely to support demand for elevator and escalator solutions as well as home access solutions for stairs, as the growing aging population will need or prefer the mobility afforded by elevators, escalators and home access solutions. In addition, growth in the elevator and escalator market is driven by a supportive regulatory environment, which requires the owners of elevator and escalator systems to invest in basic maintenance services to ensure their systems are consistently operating safely. Currently, over 50% of elevators in North America and Europe are over 20 years old. As the installed base of elevators and escalators grows and ages, property owners are increasingly in need of modernizing their elevators and escalators to ensure they comply with applicable 4 ----- regulatory requirements and continue to operate safely. In Asia/Pacific, including China and South Korea, we believe that there is a particularly strong opportunity to grow our Service and Modernization businesses driven by the aging of the installed base in those markets and stricter safety regulations requiring regular maintenance and upgrades. We believe that long-term growth in the elevator and escalator market will also be positively impacted by a continued focus on digitalization, connectivity and sustainability, as customers increasingly value features such as improved energy efficiency and enhanced safety and maintenance monitoring. According to the Market Size/ _Growth Analysis, the market for buildings with digitally automated operations or “smart buildings” is expected to_ grow at 5% per annum through 2024. We believe that our current innovative smart mobility solutions and our strong research and development capabilities position us to benefit from this demand. For example, our TWIN elevator system (“TWIN”), which combines two independent cars in one shaft, can already reduce energy costs by up to 25% and increase usable floor space by up to 25%. In addition we estimate that our MULTI system, which we are in the process of developing and will be the world’s first rope-free elevator, will allow for space reductions of up to a further 30% to 50% compared to our TWIN system. We aim to consistently increase product efficiency and provide additional value-add to our customers across our portfolio of new and existing products and services.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

We have been able to successfully monetize IoT and digital opportunities, as demonstrated by our recently developed MAX technology and our proprietary IT system, VIEW. MAX is a cloud-based maintenance tool which utilizes IoT technologies to collect data relating to customer elevator units and make diagnostic recommendations, such as when repairs need to be undertaken or which critical parts need to be replaced. VIEW is an operational business steering tool, which, among other things, automatically dispatches qualified technicians to resolve the problems identified by MAX, often even before any visible operational issues occur. Leveraging our expertise in IoT and other digital tools enables us to improve customer satisfaction by increasing service quality and efficiency, thereby increasing our customer retention rates and decreasing cancellation rates. In addition, we believe that we have created some of the most innovative elevator concepts currently in operation in the market. We are the only supplier in the industry to have an offering similar to our TWIN elevator system, which combines two independent cars in one shaft. We are also currently in the process of developing the MULTI system, which would be the world’s first rope-free elevator, allowing for space reductions of up to a further 30% to 50% compared to our TWIN system. These systems offer customers greater space efficiency and architectural flexibility than conventional designs, making us an attractive choice for a customer base that is increasingly demanding more innovative elevator and escalator products.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

Our Elevator and Escalator division has grown consistently over the years, with our Adjusted EBIT margin generally increasing since the 2011/2012 Financial Year until the 2016/2017 Financial Year. While facing some headwinds, especially from material price developments and trade tariffs implemented in recent years, we believe that, following the Transactions, there will be greater opportunity to increase our Adjusted EBIT margin. Our business benefits from high revenue visibility given the recurring and stable nature of our Service and Modernization business model. Our New Installation business represents the key enabler for growth of Service and Modernization by growing our units under maintenance and offering high visibility of future business performance due to long order-to-fulfilment times. Most of our New Installation units are converted into maintenance units, which propels our Service business. Our Service contracts on average have a gross profit margin of approximately 40%, which progressively increases over the elevator’s lifetime due to increased spare parts sales. Many of our Service business customers eventually become customers of our Modernization business, driven by an aging installed base with the need to upgrade and extend the life cycle of the elevators and escalators. The Service and Modernization businesses, which together accounted for 54% of sales and around 70% of gross profit for the 2018/2019 Financial Year, are a source of stable, recurring sales and high profit margins for the Group. Our Service contracts have an average length between one to five years.

As one of the world’s leading elevator and escalator companies, we aim to manufacture and install a substantial portion of the new elevators and escalators expected to be installed worldwide in the coming years. As a result of our global scale and strong brand recognition in the market, we believe there is significant sales potential for our New Installation business and continued growth opportunities for increasing our units under maintenance, resulting in further revenue and profit generation in our key markets. In addition, we target continued growth in all our business segments by leveraging structural factors such as an aging population, global urbanization and stricter safety requirements driving demand for maintenance and modernization services. In particular, we believe that our Service and Modernization businesses are positioned for growth as the installed base of elevators and escalators grows and ages. In the Americas, we target growth in our New Installation business, driven by expected growth in the US construction sector and our strength in meeting customer demands for efficient execution and technical excellence, such as our expertise in the hydraulic segment. We target growth in our Service business due to customer demand for high quality services with short lead times, and through reducing cancellation rates and winning service contracts for third-party installations. We also target growth in both our Service and Modernization businesses driven by increases in the average age of the installed base of elevators and escalators in the region and a strict regulatory environment. In Europe/Africa, we expect that the large, aging installed base of elevators and escalators, supported by a strict regulatory environment and high customer retention and conversion rates, will generate attractive service and 7 ----- modernization opportunities. We further expect that strong construction output, particularly from the residential segment and a slight recovery in Southern Europe as well as a more competitive product offering due to our manufacturing optimization initiatives in Spain and Germany, will drive our New Installation business and, consequently, growth in our Service and Modernization businesses. In Asia/Pacific, we aim to benefit from the anticipated growth of the new installations market, targeting robust expansion of our New Installation business, including in India and other markets. We believe that growing customer demand for high quality services and an expanding installed base will also contribute to growth in our Service and Modernization businesses. We expect that an expanding installed base of elevators and escalators and the growing importance of IoT solutions, particularly in South Korea, will lead to strong growth opportunities in our Service and Modernization businesses. We expect China, the largest elevator and escalator market in Asia, will continue to generate our highest New Installation growth globally, and that conversion of many of these newly installed units to Service contracts will continue to drive growth in the Service business. We believe that there is a particularly strong opportunity to grow our Service and Modernization businesses in China and other developing markets, driven by the growth and the aging of the installed base in those markets and stricter safety regulations requiring regular maintenance and upgrades, which many emerging market countries are adopting as their regulatory systems mature.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655
291_2,Offering 2020.md,2402,NI** **SER,2402.1,Our Strategies,2402.1.2,Core Strategy: Realize structural profitability upside,"Our Core strategy consists of realizing structural profitability upside by focusing on (i) standardization within our New Installation business, (ii) manufacturing optimization, (iii) service and modernization growth and digitalization, (iv) selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) cost reduction and (v) procurement optimization. In addition, following the Acquisition, we expect to realize additional cost savings as part of the Sponsors’ Transformation Program. _Standardization of Our New Installation Business_ We plan to continue to drive the standardization of our New Installation business by simplifying the amount and types of products and components we offer our customers. Historically, in part due to our strategy of growing through acquisitions, we provided customers with a large share of customized product solutions. This resulted in a highly diverse but overlapping product portfolio and limited price competitiveness due to the high costs of designing and producing such a wide range of individualized products. In order to optimize our structure, we are in the process of simplifying our regional product portfolio and standardizing certain components. For example, the number of product platforms in the Group has been reduced by more than half in the last decade as part of a process of implementing a simplified portfolio structure with further improvements planned going forward. In Europe, we have streamlined our major platforms down to two, which cover 80% of our products. This has resulted in synergies and a strong evolution of order intake in the first half of 2019/2020 while not impacting customers’ perception of our product offering or quantity of sales. We believe this will lead us to benefit from economies of scales, focusing our resource allocation more efficiently and allowing us to provide a more cost-competitive offering without compromising on customer service. In addition, we have also standardized and harmonized components across products to allow specific modular components, such as traction machines, controllers/inverters and doors, to be used across multiple product platforms, which we expect will result in lower costs due to the use of fewer parts, a leaner set-up, less complexity, higher agility and easier external sourcing. These initiatives are aimed at focusing our sales teams on value-based selling by presenting customers with a harmonized product portfolio of key high quality, high margin products. We plan to adapt our manufacturing to focus on products that provide our customers with one of three customization levels for low-rise buildings (less than 45 meters), mid-rise buildings (between 45 and 100 meters) and high-rise buildings (above 100 meters). These customization levels comprise: (i) Value for Money “100,” which is our lower priced option with no customization; (ii) Performance “200,” which is our moderately priced option with medium customization; and (iii) Customization “300,” which is our high priced option with full customization. This value proposition model offers customers flexible and transparent pricing, which we expect will make our products especially compelling to customers in high-volume and growth markets, such as large property developers in Asia/Pacific. Our processes, in turn, will be optimized by focusing on a leaner offering and steering our salesforces and engineers toward a focus on sales efforts based on product margin potentials and the conversion of New Installation units into Service contracts and later into Modernization sales. 8 ----- _Manufacturing Optimization_ We are engaged in an ongoing effort to optimize our manufacturing operations. These measures have included closing and, where possible, consolidating manufacturing sites, increasing outsourcing of standardized products and developing factories with improved technology for greater automation. For example, in Asia/Pacific, we have established leaner manufacturing operations, with a newly established plant in India and advances in automation at our plants in China and South Korea. In the Americas, we have consolidated all North America manufacturing at our Middleton facility to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. In Europe/Africa, we have shifted our factories away from a regional focus (in which a particular factory only serves specific countries) to a model where all factories can deliver to the entire Europe/Africa region, with each factory having a dedicated product focus. As part of this shift, we have restructured our Móstoles plant in Spain and we are currently restructuring our operations in Germany to reduce costs and simplify production. In the long term, we aim to move away from a classic factory model, where the focus is on major production and shipping of complete elevator systems and requires high personnel expenses, towards a model where we produce only key, mission critical components and outsource commoditized parts, resulting in lower fixed costs and higher productivity. _Service and Modernization Growth and Digitalization_ We aim to deliver service growth through leveraging our attractive business model and IoT innovation technology. Our business model contributes to the growth of our Service and Modernization business as, on average, 70% to 80% of New Installation contracts convert into Service contracts, and many of those Service business customers eventually become customers of the Modernization business. We aim to grow our Service business, which is a source of stable and recurring sales and high margins, by pursuing multiple initiatives aimed at increasing revenues per unit while decreasing costs. In particular, we believe that our use of digital and IoT technologies, including the recently developed MAX and VIEW systems, will enable us to improve customer satisfaction by increasing service quality and efficiency, and thereby increase customer retention rates and decrease cancellation rates. Particularly, in North America, our Service business growth is driven by the reduction of cancellation rates. We have already improved our cancellation rates and we aim to reduce our cancellation rates further through strict management focus and tools like the MAX and VIEW. We expect the growth of our Service business will contribute to new Modernization customers as the installed base grows and ages, generating an additional stream of stable and recurring revenues. We also believe that we can leverage the scale and efficiency gains achieved by MAX and VIEW to reduce the costs per unit of providing services, such as technician travel time and spare parts. In addition, we intend to increase our rate of winning customers away from competitor service providers by enhancing the efficiency of our spare parts organization, increasing our service training and leveraging the superior quality of our Service business and our capability to refurbish multi-brand spare parts through our ITS unit. _SG&A costs optimization_ We aim to reduce SG&A costs by centralizing administrative functions, adopting a range of organizational efficiency measures and improving our IT systems. Specifically, we are engaged in an ongoing effort to combine a wide array of administrative processes that historically have been performed locally, such as billing, payroll and purchasing, into shared service centers. For example, in the United States, we are in the process of consolidating these functions, previously spread over 18 locations, into one shared service center at the US headquarters in Atlanta, and we intend to roll out a similar strategy in Europe and Asia. We are also in the process of harmonizing our IT processes by rolling out VIEW globally, continuing to transition to cloud-based services, adopting global templates and standards, “delayering,” or flattening, management levels to simplify our organization and reduce overhead costs and adopting other efficiency enhancements. These measures have resulted in more than €80 million in total cost savings over the last three financial years. _Procurement Optimization_ Finally, throughout our Core strategy, we aim to reduce our procurement costs by optimizing our supply chains through commercial measures, such as, for example, supplier days, clustering managed spend, and engaging in e-auctions, continuing from measures implemented historically. For example, between the 2011/2012 Financial Year and the 2018/2019 Financial Year, our purchasing savings increased by 300%, outpacing our procurement spend which increased by 50%. 9 ----- _Transformation Program_ Following the Acquisition, we expect to realize €240 million in potential cost savings within 15 to 18 months after July 1, 2020 through the Sponsors’ Transformation Program, assuming various things, including that the program will be implemented beginning on July 1, 2020 and driven by key management, including the Chief Executive Officer of the Group. The Transformation Program focuses on cost savings opportunities related to (i) commercial operations, (ii) service operations, (iii) procurement costs, (iv) G&A costs and (v) other operational costs. Some of these initiatives will be continued through the efficiency measures, which we are already in the process of implementing, as described above. As part of our commercial operations initiatives under the Transformation Program, we aim to improve our organizational efficiency by restructuring and centralizing our sales supports team, including by shifting employees to low cost countries. In addition, we seek to increase our sales force productivity through various measures, including improving our administrative processes and completing faster technical sales. This is facilitated by our offering of fewer customization options resulting from the optimization of our product and service portfolios. We also intend to increase our focus on sales efforts based on product margin potentials and the conversion of New Installation units into Service contracts and later into Modernization sales. We expect to realize cost savings in an aggregate amount of €7 million related to our commercial operations initiatives. As part of our service operations initiatives under the Transformation Program, we aim to improve our organizational efficiency by rationalizing the number of our application engineers, reducing the number of platforms in our offering, standardizing our service offering and reducing the number of our service centers, particularly in the U.S. We intend to implement other measures under these initiatives as well, including improving process, technology and performance management in order to increase the productivity of our service technicians. We expect to realize cost savings in an aggregate amount of €15 million related to our service operations initiatives. As part of our procurement initiatives under the Transformation Program, we intend to implement multiple measures to reduce costs relating to our procurement activities. For the 2018/2019 Financial Year, we believe that our estimated addressable cost base for procurement activities comprised €2.1 billion of direct costs and €0.5 billion of indirect costs. To reduce these costs, we intend to establish group-wide supply agreements with global suppliers for key categories of direct materials, such as motors, cables and doors, including through leveraging change-of-control provisions under our existing supplier agreements with local or regional suppliers. We also expect to increase our focus on supplier driven innovation in connection with, among other things, tendering processes. To pursue improvements in specification management, we seek to standardize purchases for complex parts and establish business unit sourcing boards, which will act as advisory panels in key end markets to promote best practices and streamline procurement processes. Furthermore, we continue to shift our relationships with local suppliers to regional suppliers in order to both increase the number of sites served by our suppliers and decrease the number of our total suppliers, resulting in increased efficiencies. We also continue to streamline the amount and variety of individually supplied components in order to purchase bundles of different products and higher volumes of specific products, resulting in improved purchasing ability. Moreover, where appropriate, we target shifting to agreements with suppliers in low cost countries or otherwise shifting purchases from our suppliers of local products to products sourced from low cost countries. In addition, we are working to utilize both centralized regional lead-buyers to streamline demand-management processes and defined sourcing hubs to allow for best value and benchmark sourcing through increased spend, price and margin transparency. Furthermore, we expect to realize cost savings from our commercial operations initiatives that result in the rationalization of our product offering and standardization of our SKUs. We expect to realize cost savings in an aggregate amount of €132 million in connection with our procurement initiatives. As part of our G&A cost savings initiatives under the Transformation Program, we aim to improve our organizational efficiency and generate attrition savings through a leaner operating model, the shifting of employees to low cost countries and increased automation, including within our shared service centers. We expect to realize cost savings in an aggregate amount of €36 million related to our G&A cost savings initiatives. As part of our other operational initiatives under the Transformation Program, we aim to reduce direct and indirect personnel expenses and scrappage costs by decreasing the portion of poor quality production. We target replicating the cost of poor quality levels that we have achieved at our Korean plant (where such costs are estimated to be 0.6% of internal sales) at our other plants, particularly our Middleton plant. We also intend to outsource parts and components and streamline production overhead and assembly processes to reduce costs. We expect to realize cost savings in an aggregate amount of €50 million related to our other operational initiatives. 10 ----- We expect to incur one-off costs amounting to between €240 and €294 million in connection with these initiatives, mainly as a result of (i) voluntary redundancy, early retirement and other severance costs, (ii) staff training costs, (iii) investments in IT to digitize, automate and streamline processes, (iv) investments in the existing shared service centers in Europe, Brazil and the U.S., as well as potentially operating new, regional centers in Eastern Europe and Asia and (v) consulting, financial and legal advisory fees in connection with implementing these initiatives.

We have a long-standing German engineering heritage and a history of innovative digital solutions with the potential to transform the Elevator and Escalator division. We are a leading innovator in the elevator and escalator market and strive to address what we believe are fundamental technological challenges to better serve a rapidly urbanizing society. For example, we estimate that up to 40% of usable space in buildings is utilized for elevator shafts. Our TWIN elevator system combines two independent cars in one shaft in order to increase efficiency and creates more usable area by using up to 25% less usable space than an ordinary elevator. The TWIN elevator system’s unique value-add has made it a top choice for premier buildings around the world, including the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, Germany, and the CMA Tower in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. We believe that our MULTI elevator system, which is currently in the developing phase, has the potential to be even more compelling to the market. MULTI is a rope-less elevator able to move both vertically and horizontally, which will allow new architectural designs and unlimited building height and, we estimate, will use up to 30% to 50% less usable space than an ordinary elevator. We believe that our New Installation customers place a high value on innovative solutions like TWIN and MULTI, which both have the potential to significantly increase the usable area in buildings that is available for sale or rent. We also aim to continue to monetize our IoT technologies more effectively in the future to create sustainable business value and cash flow. By the 2021/2022 Financial Year, we aim to charge connection and monthly fees to customers for using MAX, which already supported the servicing of over 129,000 units as of March 31, 2020. Other innovations currently in the pipeline include our asset performance management solution as well as our Intelligent Gate Management System, part of our Access Solutions division. We plan to follow the MAX blueprint for these and other new products by clearly demonstrating the value of the product after launch, bringing the technology to maturity and then developing a pricing and sales model that accurately reflects our value to customers. In addition, we have a track record of successful mergers and acquisitions, including most recently our acquisitions of Nashville Machine’s elevator division and O’Keefe Elevator Company, Inc. in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. We plan to further develop our profit potential by opportunistically seeking future M&A targets, which we believe can be value accretive to the Group.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

COVID-19 has impacted markets and facilities in multiple ways, depending on the local exposure to the virus and the measures taken by local governments. Our Asia/Pacific, Americas and Europe/Africa segments, which comprise our Elevator and Escalator division, have been affected in varying degrees. The effect of COVID-19 was felt in all regions, leading to complete lockdowns in some regions and milder restrictions in others. In the Asia/Pacific region, temporary restrictions were mainly observed in China after a full lockdown of manufacturing sites in February 2020 due to government restrictions, but with recovery to almost normal operations in March 2020. India has also been affected by government restrictions and our facility in Pune is currently ramping up its operations. In the Americas, some reductions were observed in Brazil, while production in the United States remained mainly at normal levels, with only temporary restrictions on construction sites and service operations. In the Europe/Africa segment, Spain, France, Italy and Germany were the most impacted countries, with some site restrictions and temporary reductions or lockdowns in productions facilities. 15 ----- The following graphs show our estimated New Installation order intake, completed maintenance visits and manufacturing capacity during April and May 2020 in China, the DACH region, the United States and (for manufacturing capacity only) Brazil, compared to management estimates as to normal levels for each of these key performance indicators based on historical experience and prior budgeting: New installations order intake (vs. estimated regular levell l[1][1]) _Mgmt. est. regular level 50%_ Jan-20 May-20y [1] Completed maintenance visits (vs. estimated regular levellevel[1][1]) _Mgmt. est. regular level 80%_ Jan-20 May-20 Manufacturing (vs. estimated regular level[1]) _Mgmt. est. regular level 50%_ Jan-20 May-20 1.

Activities for home solutions have been operating at a lower level with partial temporary shutdowns of production facilities, but are recovering constantly. The partial or complete shutdown of most airports has led to a decrease of New Installation and Service operations due to postponements and suspensions of some projects. We have implemented a contingency plan headed by a steering committee consisting of members of our Management Board. Our contingency plan focuses on the health and safety of our workforce, cash flexibility, workforce flexibility, business continuity, sales push and communication. Cash management measures revolve around personnel savings, tight working capital management and a capital expenditure freeze. Around 15,000 employees are currently affected by these contingency measures, which include funded and non-funded furloughs and overtime reduction. Despite the negative global macroeconomic outlook as a result of COVID-19, we believe that in the medium to long term, the outbreak will not have a material adverse effect on our overall business and results of operations, due to the underlying resilience of our business and immediate implementation of contingency measures. Our New Installation business was temporarily impacted in countries with lockdown measures, as discussed above. However, all our manufacturing plants are currently operational. Our Service business has performed largely as expected, given applicable safety and regulatory requirements. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has been evolving rapidly and we are unable to predict how the outbreak may affect our business in the future.

In particular, our Financial Statements and thyssenkrupp AG’s segmental information are not prepared on the same basis, and therefore, while we believe these preliminary results and estimates to be reasonable, our actual results could vary from these estimates and these differences could be material. As such, you should not place undue reliance on this information and this information may not be indicative of our performance in the remainder of the financial year or any future period. See “Forward looking Statements,” “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this offering memorandum for a more complete discussion of certain of the factors that could affect our future performance. One Month Ended April 30, 2020_ Based on thyssenkrupp AG’s preliminary management accounts, including certain segmental information derived therefrom, we estimate that our sales for the one-month period ending April 30, 2020, was approximately €617 million compared to sales of approximately €671 million in the corresponding period in 2019, representing a decrease of 8%. We estimate that our Adjusted EBIT was approximately €53 million for the one-month period ending April 30, 2020, compared to approximately €70 million in the corresponding period in 2019 after giving effect to estimated additional standalone corporate costs in the 2019/2020 Financial Year of €30 million per annum distributed equally across each one-month period in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. The change in Adjusted EBIT represents a decrease of 24%. We estimate that our Adjusted EBIT margin was approximately 8.6% for the one-month period ending April 30, 2020, compared to approximately 10.4% in the corresponding period in 2019, representing a decrease of 1.8% points. We estimate that our order intake was approximately €645 million for the one-month period ending April 30, 2020, compared to approximately €648 million in the corresponding period in 2019, representing a decrease of 0.5%. We estimate that our business cash flow (pre-restructuring) was approximately €166 million for the one-month period ending April 30, 2020, compared to approximately €101 million in the corresponding period in 2019 after giving effect to estimated additional standalone corporate costs in the 2019/2020 Financial Year of €30 million per annum distributed equally across each one-month period in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. The change in business cash flow (pre-restructuring) represents an increase of 65%.

We estimate that our Adjusted EBIT was approximately €70 million for the one-month period ended May 31, 2020, compared to approximately €74 million in the corresponding period in 2019 after giving effect to estimated additional standalone corporate costs in the 2019/2020 Financial Year of €30 million per annum distributed equally across each one-month period in the 2018/2019 Financial Year.

Information derived from management accounts is preliminary and subject to financial closing procedures which have not yet been completed, and may not be comparable to the information we will prepare after the completion of the Transactions. Our independent auditor has not audited, reviewed, compiled, or applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to such preliminary financial information and, accordingly, does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The combined basis of preparation reflects the accounting for the carveout of the Elevator Technology Business, but differs in important ways from the basis of preparation of the results for thyssenkrupp Elevator Technology Group as they will be reported in the future. As a result, this forward-looking information may not necessarily be prepared on a comparable basis to the financial information that the thyssenkrupp Elevator Technology Group will report in respect of the year ended September 30, 2020. In addition, the following forward-looking discussion is based on certain assumptions and judgments, including, among other things, that a “second wave” of the COVID-19 pandemic will not occur, that local governments in the regions in which we operate will not reinstate lock-down and other measures that they had implemented in response to the outbreak of COVID-19 and subsequently eased or eliminated, that there will be no deterioration of general economic conditions or adverse regulatory changes, that no escalation in trade disputes will occur between the United States and China or other countries that have a material impact on our business, that central bank and government fiscal stimulus activity will not decrease in a material way, that our customers’ preferences and purchasing patterns will revert to historical averages, and that the levels of competition in our industry will not increase from historical levels. While we believe that these assumptions are reasonable, the discussion below constitutes forward-looking information, which is by its nature subject to significant uncertainty. Any of the bases for our expectations may prove to be incorrect, we cannot assure you that we have taken all factors into account that could impact our results of operations for the financial year ending September 30, 2020, and our performance may be affected by a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including the actual development of the COVID-19 pandemic or any of the other factors and uncertainties described elsewhere in this offering memorandum. Many of these risks and uncertainties are beyond our control, and could cause our actual results and performance to differ materially from any expected future results or performance expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements included herein. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on the following discussion as a prediction of actual results or otherwise. Neither our independent auditors, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect to the forecast presented below, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability, and assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, the forecast. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise the discussion below or any other forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

For the financial year ending September 30, 2020, we expect that our order intake, sales and Adjusted EBIT will range from remaining stable to being down by single digit percentage points, each as compared to the prior year. For the financial year ended September 30, 2019, our order intake, sales and Adjusted EBIT were €8,172 million, €7,961 million and €819 million, respectively. 19 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

Our elevator technology business has significantly increased cash generation since 2011/2012, roughly doubling its business cash flow through generating higher profits and reducing operating net working capital by approximately 80%. Our cash conversion rate was approximately 90% in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. Excluding certain one-off expenditures incurred from time to time (such as €3 million, €6 million and €106 million for major mergers and acquisition projects in the 2016/2017, 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 Financial Years (including the acquisitions of Nashville Machine’s elevator division and O’Keefe Elevator Company, Inc.) as well as carve-out related one-time expenditures of €1,080 million paid in connection with the Licensing Agreement fee for use of the “thyssenkrupp” brand and of €74 million for carve-out related real estate transfers, in both cases, in the 2018/2019 Financial Year), our capital expenditures were €145 million, €115 million, and €129 million for the 2016/2017 Financial Year, the 2017/2018 Financial Year and the 2018/2019 Financial Year, respectively, highlighting our generally stable and relatively limited capital investment requirements. See “Summary Financial and Other Data—Other Financial, Operating and Pro Forma Information—Other _Financial and Operating Information.” We believe that the development of business cash flow and cash_ conversion over the last three financial years demonstrates that we operate an asset-light business with relatively low capital requirements and high cash returns. In addition, we believe our business offers significant operational improvement potential and profitability upside. We have recently implemented several cost optimization initiatives that we believe will generate greater margins. For example, we have restructured our manufacturing operations by optimizing our footprint and leveraging shared services and best practices, as well as streamlining our product offerings. These initiatives have led to stable development in cost of goods sold by partially offsetting personnel cost inflation through efficiency measures and headcount management, and compensating for material cost increases through purchasing measures and the improved management of procurement volume. These efficiency measures have also reduced SG&A costs as a percentage of sales from 18.5% in the 2016/2017 Financial Year to 16.4% in the twelve months ended March 31, 2020. In addition, following the Acquisition, we expect to realize an additional estimated €240 million in potential cost savings within 15 to 18 months after July 1, 2020, as part of the Sponsors’ transformation program (the “Transformation Program”).

We define Adjusted EBIT as EBIT, as adjusted for special items as described below. We define Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBIT, as adjusted further by adding back depreciation and amortization expense. We define Lease Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA, as adjusted further for the estimated effect of our adoption of IFRS 16 as if it had been adopted at the beginning of each period presented. See “Presentation of Financial Information— _Non-GAAP Financial Measures—General” for further information on how Lease Adjusted EBITDA is calculated. We define Pro Forma_ Adjusted EBITDA as Lease Adjusted EBITDA, as adjusted further for certain cost savings adjustments as set forth in the tables below. EBIT, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBITDA, Lease Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA are collectively referred to herein as our “EBITDA-based measures.” We believe that our EBITDA-based measures are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance and our ability to incur and service our indebtedness. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is adjusted for certain items that we believe are not indicative of our underlying operating performance. We believe that Lease Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it gives pro forma effect to the application of IFRS 16 as if it had been adopted at the beginning of the relevant period. See “Presentation of _Financial Information—Non-GAAP Financial Measures—General” for further information on how Lease Adjusted EBITDA is_ calculated. We believe that Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it gives effect to cost saving initiatives we expect to implement after the Transactions. Our EBITDA-based measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles. Our EBITDA-based measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and the other EBITDA-based measures presented herein differ from Consolidated EBITDA as defined in the Indentures governing the Notes. Because of these limitations, our EBITDA-based measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to service our indebtedness. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our Financial Statements included elsewhere herein and using these non-GAAP measures only to supplement evaluation of our performance. See “Presentation of Financial Information— _Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”_ 36 ----- Set forth below is a reconciliation of each of EBIT, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBITDA, Lease Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA to net income which we believe is their closest comparable IFRS measure.

In the periods up to September 30, 2019, the Elevator Technology Business was using the “thyssenkrupp” brand under an operating licensing model for which it incurred license fees recognized in profit or loss in other expenses. As of September 30, 2019, the operating licensing model was terminated and thus the license fees we incurred in prior periods are non-recurring and have been added back to EBIT. On September 30, 2019, the Elevator Technology Business entered into a new license agreement with the remaining thyssenkrupp Group for the right to use the “thyssenkrupp” brand for certain classified classes relevant for the Elevator Technology Business in exchange for a one-time fee and with no other recurring expenses after September 30, 2019. In connection with the Acquisition, the License Agreement was amended in March 2020, resulting in the intangible asset representing the right of use of the “thyssenkrupp” brand to be classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 in the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. The re-classification resulted in a non-recurring, non-cash impairment charge against the intangible asset, which we have added back to EBIT. See “Certain _Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Relationships with the thyssenkrupp Group in the Past—License Agreement” and_ Note 1 to the Audited Combined Financial Statements and to the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. (B) Represents restructuring expenses and net impairment losses plus certain other non-operating income and expense items if such items individually exceed a de minimis threshold of €0.5 million. In the periods presented, the majority of our restructuring costs relate to cost savings programs and operational improvement measures implemented at our European factories, our French, Spanish and German operations and our US operations. The large majority of our net impairment losses in Financial Year 2017 was due to the impairment of trade accounts receivable following a restructuring program in the Middle East, which had been initiated in 2016. Other special items include mainly (i) non-recurring costs related to project re-evaluations following the restructuring program in the Middle East in Financial Year 2016/2017, (ii) restructuring costs in Europe/Africa; legal fees, penalties and remediation costs following inspections in Ontario, Canada and impairments of receivables and inventories in the Middle East in the 2017/2018 Financial Year and (iii) restructuring related costs in Europe/Africa and an unclaimed properties provision (€24 million) already partially recorded previously by thyssenkrupp and then allocated to the Elevator Technology Business in the Financial Year 2018/2019.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

Our transition to IFRS 16 resulted in an increase of interest expense on leases, an increase of depreciation of lease assets and a decrease of rent expenses on operating leases. Because interest expense and depreciation are both expenses that are added back to net income in calculating Adjusted EBITDA, our adoption of IFRS 16 had a positive impact on our Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended March 31, 2020. We present Lease Adjusted EBITDA to illustrate the estimated impact IFRS 16 would have had on our Adjusted 37 ----- EBITDA for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020 if we had adopted IFRS 16 on April 1, 2019. See “Presentation of Financial _Information—Non-GAAP Financial Measures—General” for further information on how Lease Adjusted EBITDA is calculated._ (D) Our Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, has been negatively impacted by corporate cost allocations from thyssenkrupp AG that we do not consider to be representative of our standalone costs going forward because they were allocated retrospectively in accordance with carve-out accounting principles. These cost allocations were calculated as a proportion of thyssenkrupp AG’s overall corporate costs, based on allocation metrics such as revenue contribution of the Elevator Technology Business rather than a systematic review of the organization, FTEs and infrastructure that would be required to perform the relevant functions as a stand-alone business, and negatively impacted our Adjusted EBITDA by €98 million, €71 million, €73 million, €30 million and €16 million in the 2016/2017 Financial Year, 2017/2018 Financial Year, 2018/2019 Financial Year, the six months ended March 31, 2019 and the three months ended December 31, 2019, respectively. We incurred actual standalone costs of €10 million in the three months ended March 31, 2020, which included some ramp-up costs that we do not expect to continue, and thus estimate that our actual standalone costs will amount to approximately €30 million per annum going forward. We have therefore taken (i) the €69 million of our combined corporate cost allocations and actual standalone costs during the twelve months ended March 31, 2020 less (ii) our €30 million estimate of actual standalone costs per annum going forward, and added the difference back to Adjusted EBITDA. While we build up additional governance and other functions, the relevant corporate services that comprise part of these standalone costs will be provided to by thyssenkrupp AG via a combination of direct service agreements and the New TSAs, which may impact our estimate of these costs in the short term. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of _Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Corporate cost allocations.”_ (E) In connection with the Acquisition, Advent and Cinven commissioned a third-party due diligence report from a global consulting firm to analyze the financial condition and operations of the Elevator Technology Business and its potential for achieving cost savings. This report has identified €240 million in potential cost savings, which we expect to realize through our Transformation Program within 15 to 18 months after July 1, 2020. We give effect to these cost saving initiatives in calculating Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as if the underlying cost savings had been realized on April 1, 2019. We expect to incur one-off costs amounting to between €240 and €294 million in connection with these initiatives, mainly as a result of (i) voluntary redundancy, early retirement and other severance costs, (ii) staff training costs, (iii) investments in IT to digitize, automate and streamline processes, (iv) investments in existing shared service centers in Europe, Brazil and the U.S., as well as potentially operating new, regional centers in Eastern Europe and Asia and (v) consulting, financial and legal advisory fees in connection with implementing these initiatives. The cost savings adjustments set forth in the following table are based on various assumptions and estimates by external consultants and management regarding the future impact of our cost saving initiatives, including that implementation of the Transformation Program will commence on July 1, 2020 and will be driven by key management, including the Chief Executive Officer of the Target, even prior to the Acquisition Closing Date. We believe this assumption is reasonable because some of the initiatives under the Transformation Program are a continuation of the Target’s existing efficiency measures and the Acquisition is expected to complete during the course of July 2020. This information is inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those assumed in the adjustments below. As a result, while we believe that these adjustments and potential cost savings are reasonable estimates, the actual results and cost savings in any given period may differ from those estimated herein, including because much of the savings we expect to achieve are from procurement initiatives which depend on negotiations with third-party suppliers that are outside our control. We may not be able to realize these cost savings, either in the amount or within the timeframe we currently anticipate, and the costs of achieving these cost savings may be higher than expected.

(b) Represents expected cost savings related to our service operations initiatives, comprising (i) €4 million of cost savings from organizational efficiency, including the rationalization of the number of our application engineers, as a result of reducing the number of platforms in our offering and standardizing our services, (ii) €2 million of cost savings from a reduction in the number of our service centers, particularly in the U.S. and (iii) €9 million of cost savings from other initiatives, such as increased productivity of service technicians through process, technology and performance management improvements. 38 ----- (c) Represents expected cost savings related to our procurement initiatives, comprising: i. €45 million of cost savings from (1) the establishment of group-wide supply agreements with global suppliers for key categories of direct materials, such as motors, cables and doors, including through leveraging change-of-control provisions under our existing supplier agreements with local or regional suppliers, (2) increased focus on supplier driven innovation in connection with, among other things, tendering processes, (3) improvements in specification management by standardizing purchases for complex parts and (4) the establishment of business unit sourcing boards to act as advisory panels in key end markets to promote best practices and streamline procurement processes; ii. €11 million of cost savings from shifting from local suppliers to regional suppliers to increase the number of sites served by our suppliers and decrease the number of our total suppliers in order to improve efficiencies; iii. €25 million of cost savings from shifting from local suppliers to regional suppliers to streamline the amount and variety of individually supplied components in order to purchase bundles of different products and higher volumes of specific products to improve purchasing ability; iv. €17 million of cost savings from shifting purchases from our suppliers of local products to products sourced from low cost countries; and v. €34 million of cost savings from other initiatives, such as (1) the utilization of centralized regional lead-buyers to streamline demand-management processes and of defined sourcing hubs to allow for best value and benchmark sourcing through increased spend, price and margin transparency, (2) shifting to suppliers in low cost countries and (3) our commercial operations initiatives to rationalize our product offering and standardize our SKUs. The estimated addressable cost base for our procurement activities was made up of €2.1 billion of direct costs and €0.5 billion of indirect costs for the 2018/2019 Financial Year. (d) Represents expected cost savings related to our other operational initiatives, comprising (i) €28 million of cost savings from (1) increased productivity, (2) a reduction in direct and indirect personnel expenses and (3) a reduction of scrappage costs by decreasing the portion of poor quality production to replicate levels achieved at our Korean plant (where such costs are estimated to be 0.6% of internal sales), particularly at our Middleton plant, (ii) €7 million of cost savings from outsourcing parts and components and (iii) €15 million of cost savings as a result of streamlining production overhead and assembly processes. (e) Represents expected cost savings related to initiatives targeting our general and administrative costs, comprising (i) €20 million of cost savings from attrition savings and organizational efficiency through a leaner operating model and increased automation, including within our shared service centers, and the shifting of FTEs to low cost countries and (ii) €16 million of cost savings from other initiatives. (2) Pro forma net senior secured indebtedness represents the sum of the pro forma consolidated financial debt of the EUR SSN Issuer that is secured by a first-priority lien on the SSN Collateral less the pro forma consolidated cash and cash equivalents of the EUR SSN Issuer, as set forth under “Capitalization.” Pro forma net senior secured indebtedness excludes (i) guarantees of the Senior Notes and of the Private Senior Notes, (ii) all of our lease liabilities (amounting to €330 million) and (iii) amounts which may be drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility to fund cash to the Target Group as of the Acquisition Closing Date. See “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalization.” (3) Pro forma net indebtedness represents the pro forma consolidated financial debt of the SUN Issuer, less the pro forma consolidated cash and cash equivalents of the SUN Issuer, each as set forth under “Capitalization.” Pro forma net indebtedness excludes (i) all of our lease liabilities (amounting to €330 million) and (ii) amounts which may be drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility to fund cash to the Target Group as of the Acquisition Closing Date. See “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalization.”. (4) Pro forma interest expense represents the estimated interest expense of the Group on a pro forma basis for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020, after giving effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on April 1, 2020, subject to the assumptions set forth under “Use of Proceeds.” Pro forma interest expense includes commitment fees payable on the Revolving Credit Facility, but excludes any interest expense in respect of amounts which may be drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility to fund cash to the Target Group as of the Acquisition Closing Date. See “Capitalization.” Pro forma interest expense is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what our interest expense would have actually been had the Transactions occurred on April 1, 2019; nor does it purport to project our interest expense for any future period or our financial position at any future date. 39 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

We have extracted (i) the combined historical financial information of the Elevator Technology Business for the 2016/2017, 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 Financial Years from the Audited Combined Financial Statements and (ii) the consolidated historical financial information of the Elevator Technology Business as of and for the six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2020 from the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements, in each case, included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. As the Elevator Technology Business did not exist as a separate group and since all companies and operating activities within the Elevator Technology Business were under the common control of thyssenkrupp AG, in each case, prior to the Reorganization, the financial information presented as of and for the financial years ended September 30, 2017, 2018 and 2019 has been prepared on a combined basis. Effective with the Reorganization, the Elevator Technology Business came into existence as a separate group and therefore, the financial information presented for the Target and its consolidated subsidiaries as of and for the six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2020 was prepared on a consolidated basis. There are important differences between the Elevator Technology Business as presented in the Audited Combined Financials as of and for the 2016/2017, 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 Financial Years and the business carried out by the Target and its subsidiaries as presented in the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2020. See “Presentation of Financial Information—Basis of Preparation” and our Financial Statements included elsewhere herein. The independent auditor’s report on the Audited Combined Financial Statements is qualified due to issues regarding local book keeping and financial reporting processes, which led to qualified, adverse or disclaimer of opinions on the financial information of certain entities of the Elevator Technology Business’s Operating Unit Spanish Latin America in several instances as of September 30, 2018 and 2017 and for the financial years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The auditor’s qualification does not pertain to the combined statement of financial position as of September 30, 2019 included in the Audited Combined Financial Statements. In the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements, the issues relating to the Elevator Technology Business’s Operating Unit Spanish Latin America described above still remained for the six-month period ended March 31, 2019. See “Presentation of Financial Information” and our Financial Statements included elsewhere herein. The financial information of the Group for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020, is unaudited and has been calculated by taking the financial information for the six months ended March 31, 2020 (as derived from the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements) and adding it to the difference between the results of operations for the year ended September 30, 2019 (as derived from the Audited Combined Financial Statements) and the interim financial information for the six months ended March 31, 2019 (as derived from the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements).

291_2,Offering 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,13.1.1,We operate in a highly competitive industry and are subject to pricing pressure.,"The elevator technology business is a highly competitive sector in a mature industry with a relatively small number of large, established market participants in each of the New Installation, Service and Modernization businesses. In the New Installation business, we mostly compete to sell and install the elevator technology unit, but in some instances, we also compete with market participants that sell elevators, escalators or components to third-party distributors who undertake the installation themselves. Our competitors for the New Installation business are generally consolidated in most of the markets in which we operate, but in certain countries, such as China, there is more fragmentation. Competitors in this business include global elevator manufacturers, such as KONE, Otis and Schindler; elevator technology units of large technology multinationals, such as Hitachi and Mitsubishi, both of which are particularly, but not exclusively, competitive in the Asian markets; and a number of other global, regional and local manufacturers. Key factors affecting competition in the New Installation business include initial product price, brand reputation and image, lead time for delivery, cost of ownership, warranty terms, product safety, technology and innovation, design, quality and performance. In the Service and Modernization businesses, we compete to provide maintenance and modernization services to customers irrespective of which company manufactured and installed the original equipment. The postinstallation maintenance services market is very competitive in its own right. Our customers in our New Installation business are not obliged to engage us for providing post-installation services. Further, most of our service agreements have a duration of one through five years. Therefore, there is potential for substantial churn in our customers, among various service providers in the market. Competitors in these businesses include many of our competitors in the New Installation business who also offer post-installation maintenance and modernization services, as well as companies focused on providing these services exclusively. This is particularly true in China, which has a large number of such service-only companies and, as a result, an especially competitive and fragmented elevator services market. Other areas, such as Europe and North America, have more consolidated service markets, but nonetheless, with high levels of competition. Key factors affecting competition in the Service and Modernization businesses include the quality and scope, pricing and other terms of maintenance and repair services, modernization service and technological support as well as overall customer satisfaction. Technology has become an increasingly important differentiator, as it enables service providers to plan, execute and anticipate maintenance and repair needs more precisely. In addition, our Service business and, to a certain extent, our Modernization business, are dependent on the New Installation business for a material portion of their new customers and serviced units. This is because most customers or units from the New Installation business enter into service agreements or convert into service units, as applicable, with us, and may eventually become customers of the Modernization business. As a result, a decline in customers and installed units in the New Installation business due to increasing competition would most likely have an adverse impact on the number of new customers and serviced units for the Service and Modernization businesses. 42 ----- Revenue generated by our Service business exceeded 40% of our total revenue in each of the years ended September 30, 2017, 2018 and 2019. Loss of customers due to any of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our overall results of operation and financial condition. In all of our businesses, key competitive risks include falling prices due to competition, and a consequent decline in margins, loss of customers and market share. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, marketing and operating resources than us, positioning them to potentially maintain or increase their market shares to our detriment. Companies with larger pools of service and maintenance customers than us benefit from their incumbent status with those customers and the recurring revenue generated by their service contracts. Our competitors could adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements, technological developments and market trends than we do, differentiate themselves more effectively, for example by using technological innovation to develop a disruptive elevator model, or improve the functionality or performance of their products and services more quickly or in a more cost-effective manner. Some of the smaller service companies with which our Service and Modernization businesses compete may be more agile and price-competitive in their local markets and may as a result, undercut our ability to win new customers and retain the existing ones. If we are not able to compete effectively, our market share may reduce, there may be further pressure on our prices and our sales and margins may decline, all of which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655
291_2,Offering 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,13.1.2,Our future business success depends on our ability to respond to evolving market trends with innovative products and services on competitive terms.,"The elevator technology market is characterized by a degree of technological change, as well as by product enhancements and developments, especially in the service and modernization markets. Our future success is therefore dependent on our ability to anticipate customer needs, develop and market new products and services and differentiate our product and service offerings from those of our competitors on a timely basis and on commercially attractive terms. Changes in customer requirements and preferences, new substitute technologies or evolving industry standards and practices could render our existing products obsolete or less attractive. In particular, the elevator technology market is currently subject to a number of market trends and technical developments to which we are required to respond. The trend towards digitalization and other advances has led to a growth in potential new applications across the elevator and escalator markets, such as so-called smart elevators and escalators and smart buildings, which use digital technology to enhance efficiency and performance, leading in turn to higher customer expectations. For example, customers are increasingly demanding that their elevators deliver reduced travel and waiting time, more customized and convenient travel, higher safety and quality standards and increased energy efficiency. In order to develop suitable solutions for such changing customer expectations, we have made in the past, and we expect we will continue to make in the future, substantial investments into research and development. There can be no assurance, however, that these efforts will be successful or that potential customers will not prefer solutions offered by our competitors. Moreover, developing new products and product lines is complex, time-consuming and costly, and involves a high degree of risk. Our ability to bring new products to the market may require both significant external funding and reinvestment of profit, including to acquire additional equipment and production capacity. Delays may occur irrespective of these efforts, resulting in forgone sales revenue and reputational damage. Moreover, market developments are difficult to predict and our products and technologies may not gain as wide an acceptance as we expected at the time of our investment. For example, we have recently launched products such as “MAX,” our cloud- based maintenance tool, and have products in the development pipeline, such as our MULTI elevator system, in which we have invested considerable time and money. It is not yet clear whether these products will win widespread customer acceptance or meet our financial expectations in a timely manner, if at all. Furthermore, the development and marketing of new products can lead to cost overruns in case of inaccurate planning and budgeting. If we fail to adapt to prevailing trends and customer requirements in a timely manner or if our products and services do not gain market acceptance or experience significant cost overruns, our investments in research and development may not yield expected returns, our market share could reduce and our reputation may be impacted. Any or all of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 43 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,655
291_2,Offering 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,13.1.3,The outbreak of COVID-19 and its global economic impact may materially affect our business and results of operations.,"Our business could be adversely affected by the outbreak of contagious diseases, including the recent outbreak of COVID-19. COVID-19 was first announced in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and since then has spread to most regions of the world including Europe, Asia, North America and South America. Following the outbreak of COVID-19 in other countries, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to constitute a global pandemic. COVID-19 has resulted in lockdowns and various levels of restrictions of movement being imposed globally, including most countries in which we sell our products and services. The restrictions include curtailing travel, closure of schools, prohibitions of mass gatherings, mandatory remote working, and in some countries, the ability to access construction sites and office buildings. Specifically to our business, all the regions in which we operate our Elevator and Escalator division were affected by varying degrees. The Access Solutions division has been affected in each of its home solutions and airport solutions offerings. See “Summary—Recent Developments—Coronavirus (COVID-19).” Measures and restrictions by governments have caused and may continue to cause the overall macroeconomic conditions in the regions in which we operate and the end-markets in which we sell our products and services to deteriorate. Were a recession to occur, we cannot predict the length of such recession or the short- and long-term impact it may have on the global economy or our business specifically. Any or all such consequences may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak and related travel advisories and restrictions and the impact of COVID-19 on the overall economy and pace of its overall recovery, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. In addition, COVID-19 may delay or diminish the global trend of increasing urbanization, which could reduce global demand for new construction and therefore impact our business. According to IHS, global residential construction spending is expected to decline by 1.5% in 2020, as opposed to pre-COVID-19 estimates of a growth of 1.9%. Further, global non-residential construction is expected to decline by 1.7% in 2020, as opposed to pre-COVID-19 estimates of a growth of 1.5%. There are no comparable recent events that provide us with guidance, and so we cannot assure you that COVID-19 and its consequent economic effects, or any future outbreak of another virus or other contagious diseases, will not have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. To the extent COVID-19 continues to adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition and operating results, it may also have the effect of heightening other risks described in this section, such as those related to indebtedness, our need to generate sufficient cash flows to service our high level of indebtedness, and our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655
291_2,Offering 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,13.1.4,We may not be able to adjust our personnel and production capacity in line with demand for our products and services.,"Demand for our products and services is a function of a wide range of factors, including market cyclicality and other dynamics, and can be difficult to predict. In particular, the New Installation business is closely linked with the construction sector and is therefore exposed to significant fluctuations in construction activity levels. Economic uncertainty, particularly economic downturns, may make it difficult for us to estimate the optimal level of production capacity, to match our workforce size with conditions in the affected markets and to predict our future working capital requirements. From time to time we have experienced, and we may experience in the future, under-utilization of our production and installation personnel capacity at several of our production facilities as a result of overestimating demand for our products and services. Capacity under-utilization may result in lower returns on the capital invested in building such capacity, write-offs on fixed assets and lower product prices, as well as personnel and other costs associated with maintaining an unnecessarily large workforce, each of which can result in reduced profit margins. We use measures such as flexible work hours, outsourcing of certain tasks, temporary workers and production network configuration to calibrate production and personnel capacity. However, these measures may be inadequate if the decline in demand for our products and services is greater than expected. In addition, we may not be able to adjust production capacity or personnel in response to economic or market downturns as planned for political, regulatory or legal reasons, such as employment laws and collective agreements that limit our ability to adjust the size of our workforce in certain jurisdictions, including in member states of the European Union. Restructuring measures in connection with capacity adjustments, such as those we have undertaken in our Middleton, Neuhausen and other manufacturing facilities, could also lead to significant one-off costs. 44 ----- Conversely, if we underestimate demand and have inadequate capacity to meet customer requirements, we may be compelled to turn away business or miss shipping and project deadlines, resulting in contractual penalties, loss of customers and market share, loss of revenue and damage to our reputation. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655
291_2,Offering 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,13.1.5,"Products that do not meet customer specifications or that contain defects or errors could result in significant costs for us, including from warranty and product liability claims.","We are subject to the risk of product defects and defective installation, maintenance or modernization services. Our New Installation products typically include a contractual one to three year warranty period, but may be subject to a warranty period of up to according to statutory building laws, depending on the applicable legislation. The risks are especially present when products are first introduced or when new versions or enhancements of existing products are released. When the potential for systemic product defects is higher, such a defect may impact an entire class of products. Product defects or negligence in the provision of services, or allegations of such, can give rise to contractual warranty, product liability, negligence and other claims. This can be the case even if the product defect in question is caused by a faulty component or equipment provided by a third-party supplier. Moreover, we are often contractually required to indemnify customers for damages or losses resulting from defective products or negligently performed services. Product defects may also necessitate costly product recalls. In addition, defects in our products could have severe consequences on end-users and third parties, including injury and loss of life. In the event of an accident involving our products or services, we could be subject to claims for negligence, claims in relation to fatal accidents, personal injury, physical damage, product liability and other lawsuits. Such lawsuits and other similar proceedings can be expensive to defend and may divert the attention of management and other personnel, regardless of the ultimate outcome. While we have a third-party product liability insurance program, there can be no assurances that such insurance will provide coverage against all potential liabilities or that we will be able to maintain such insurance on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Similarly, we generally record warranty provisions in our accounts based on past experience and known claims, but there can be no assurance that such provisions will be adequate for any liability ultimately incurred as a result of potential product defects or negligence in connection with any of our businesses. In addition, product defects could require costly product re-designs, recall actions and could damage our reputation, which could in turn harm our customer relationships and lead to reduced sales. It is also possible that product defects could result in criminal liability for members of our management regarding their conduct relating to the relevant product defect, including charges of involuntary homicide or negligent physical injury, which could also damage our reputation and divert the attention of management from its responsibilities. Any of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655
291_2,Offering 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,13.1.6,"Our products and services are subject to a range of different legal and regulatory requirements worldwide, compliance with which is costly and burdensome and non-compliance with which may result in significant costs and liabilities.","Our products and services must comply with a broad range of complex legal and regulatory requirements in the numerous jurisdictions in which we operate. Such laws and regulations include, among others, building codes, health and safety regulations, industry standards, laws governing public bidding processes, and labor laws governing local employee and sub-contractor relationships. Such laws and regulations may vary substantially by jurisdiction, and even within certain jurisdictions. For example, within the United States, each individual state has adopted a specific building code which references standards for elevators and escalators and which is based, in most cases, on the International Building Code (“IBC”), in some cases with local variations. Within the EU, an array of directives and regulations relating to lifts and public safety apply to our business, including technical lift regulations and safety norms for existing lifts, complemented by laws promulgated by individual member states such as Germany, France, Italy and Spain. Other key jurisdictions where we do business, including mainland China, have their own building codes, safety regulations and other laws and regulations which apply to our products and services. Many jurisdictions regularly revise and update these regulations. In addition, we are subject to an array of labor laws in the markets where we do business, which are particularly restrictive in Europe, but can also impact our business in all of our other markets. For example, in South Korea the government recently passed a directive regulating the degree and conditions under which companies can rely on local sub-contractors, due to which we will need to employ more service technicians on our rolls to perform 45 ----- services directly and also employ two service technicians for certain services, such as monthly maintenance. The laws and regulations applicable to our products and services can vary considerably in their content, interpretation and enforcement from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. As a result, our cost of compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements is considerable, and such costs may increase further in the future, given the expected stricter enforcement by regulators globally, particularly in the areas of safety and energy efficiency. Such laws and regulations are also subject to change on short notice, imposing an additional compliance burden on us. Any changes to the laws and regulations governing our products and new product approvals could require modifications to our products as well as our manufacturing equipment, requiring additional labor and material costs in order to ensure compliance. A violation by us of applicable laws or regulations or the failure to meet legal or regulatory standards could lead to the imposition of penalties, fines, damages, recalls, restrictions on or prohibitions of business operations and other adverse consequences. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655
291_2,Offering 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,13.1.7,Demand for our products and services depends on economic conditions globally and in our principal regional areas of activity.,"Our results of operations depend significantly on economic conditions globally and in our key jurisdictions of activity, particularly in Europe/Africa, the Americas and Asia/Pacific. We operate in these key jurisdictions mainly through our Europe/Africa, Americas and Asia/Pacific segments, which contributed 26%, 41% and 28%, respectively, of our Operating Segments’ total sales in the 2018/2019 Financial Year, with the outstanding percentage contributed by our remaining segments for which we do not present geography-based sales splits. Demand for our products and services, especially in the New Installation business, is driven by activity levels and capital expenditures within the industries we serve, in particular the residential and commercial construction industry. These industries are highly cyclical and sensitive to changes in global economic conditions, GDP growth in the relevant markets, inflation, the interest rate environment and conditions in the credit markets. This cyclicality may result in significant fluctuations in revenue and profitability from period to period and over the business cycle. Our New Installation business also serves customers in certain specialized industry segments, mainly industrial applications and large infrastructure projects (such as subway or metro stations), which are also sensitive to economic conditions. A weak or uncertain economic environment in one of our key regions or globally may result in fewer construction, industrial and infrastructure projects and lower business volume for our customers. This, combined with rising costs of capital and low business and consumer confidence, may cause customers to delay, cancel, or altogether refrain from New Installation of our products and lower our revenues from the segment. Even if some customers were to proceed with new installations, the decline in activity levels in a particular region would likely lead to more competition and pricing pressure on our New Installation business, which could adversely impact our margins. This risk may be more pronounced in countries like China, where our New Installation business accounts for a higher proportion of revenue than in other regions, and where demand for new installations has experienced downturns in the past due to excessive housing supply and restrictive government policies on new construction in certain metropolitan cities. Our Service and Modernization businesses are generally impacted to a lesser extent than New Installations by an economic downturn as customers in most markets are legally obligated to comply with elevator services and safety requirements. However, our New Installation business is an important source of new customers for the Service and Modernization businesses. Therefore, a decline in our New Installation business could therefore eventually lead to fewer new customers in our Service and Modernization businesses, resulting in lower sales as well as more competition for services and modernization contracts, putting pressure on the prices we charge for our services and consequently resulting in lower margins. Poor economic conditions could also encourage customers to delay modernization initiatives. Volatility in global financial markets, higher interest rates, unemployment rates, trade policy and conflicts, consumer confidence, lower corporate earnings, tighter credit conditions and public and private debt levels could impact economic conditions. Furthermore, geopolitical tensions, terrorism, natural catastrophes, pandemics or other unforeseen events may prompt unexpected, short-term responses from the markets and declines in demand for our products, leading to lower sales. For example, Europe, our largest geographic market, is facing sharply slowing economic growth and a number of structural issues, including lingering debt crises and political instability in certain EU member states and deteriorating confidence in the institutions of the European Union, each of which could pose a threat to future European integration and cause prolonged economic uncertainty or an economic downturn. In addition, economic and financial conditions may continue to be adversely affected by the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union. 46 ----- Global economic developments are also currently subject to a high degree of uncertainty with respect to the stability of the global trade and tariff framework. The trade war between the United States and China, withdrawal from or renegotiation of bi- and multi-lateral trade agreements by the United States, or any countermeasures by regional or global trading partners, including the European Union, could have a negative impact on the global economic environment. These could result in lower investment in residential and commercial construction projects, as well as industrial and infrastructure projects, and a decline in construction levels generally, leading in turn to less demand for our products. In China, one our most significant individual sales areas, economic growth decelerated to the slowest annual rate in decades in 2018, as consumer spending and capital investment declined amid the country’s trade conflict with the United States. The slowing Chinese economy has reportedly adversely impacted the credit supply, triggering defaults and other payment problems by several construction companies and leading to suspensions of certain high-rise projects. Any economic slowdown, downturn or uncertainty, either globally or locally in our markets, could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services. Such events could put pressure on the prices we charge, resulting in declines in our sales and margins and have a material adverse effect on our business, overall financial condition and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

Tariffs and other barriers to trade can adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including by causing less favorable conditions for the import and export of parts and components and by increasing our cost of production. Barriers to trade can increase the cost of raw materials, such as steel and aluminum, increasing the cost of parts and components used to manufacture our products, as well as of spare parts used in our Service and Modernization businesses. For example, our US operation imports a significant number of components from external suppliers in China, such as electronic parts and guiderails, which have become more expensive as a result of the ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China. Trade barriers can also disrupt our operations within certain countries or markets by delaying imports and exports or by interrupting international supply lines upon which we rely. Finally, trade barriers can also adversely affect demand for our products indirectly through the impact they have on our customers’ business growth and investment activities and their impact on general economic conditions. See “—Demand for our products and services depends on economic _conditions globally and in our principal regional areas of activity.”_ Any barriers to trade or other protectionist measures may limit our ability to make use of opportunities from globalized supply chains and other advantages of the global trading system, increase our cost of production or our products’ prices and could therefore undermine our competitiveness and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655
291_2,Offering 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,13.1.9,"We are dependent on third-party suppliers, contractors and distributors.","We are dependent on third-party suppliers, contractors and sub-contractors and distributors for the timely delivery of high-quality materials, components and equipment for the manufacture of our products. _Dependence on suppliers._ If a supplier fails to provide materials, components and equipment as contractually required, or provides materials, components and equipment that are not of an acceptable quality or which contain defects or errors or which are delivered on a delayed basis, we may be required to source those supplies or equipment services from alternate sources. This may result in higher costs, production downtime, inventory backlogs, costly adjustments to or a re-engineering of our products and delayed completion of project milestones. If we use low quality or defective components or equipment, we may be exposed to contractual warranty, product liability, negligence and other claims. Supply and service interruptions can be the result of a number of factors beyond our control, including product shortages, labor strikes, capacity constraints, regulatory issues or financial distress of the supplier. The risk of supply interruptions is heightened in instances in which we rely on a small number of suppliers for the provision of a product or service. In addition to the risk of supply interruptions, the supplier of a key product or service potentially could exert significant bargaining power over price, quality, warranty or other terms relating to the product or service. We seek to mitigate such risks through the use of supply agreements containing provisions designed to avoid such scenarios and aim to have at least two suppliers for important parts and components. However, such agreements and measures may not always be effective. 47 ----- _Dependence on contractors and sub-contractors._ In addition to external suppliers of goods, we also depend on the services of third-party contractors and sub-contractors for a significant portion of the work performed, especially in our New Installation business. We may not always be able to hire qualified contractors and sub-contractors at acceptable prices, especially during periods of high demand when our competitors may block the installation capacities of our main installation contractors, rendering them unavailable to us. If we are unable to hire qualified contractors or sub-contractors, our ability to maintain our customer relationships could be impaired. Moreover, we remain responsible for the successful completion of our contractors or sub-contractors’ work towards our own contractual partners. As a result, we may be subject to significant reputational damage, losses or liabilities if contractors or sub-contractors fail to perform, if serious accidents involving the contractors or sub-contractors occur, or should the contractors or sub-contractors become insolvent. In addition, a failure by a third-party contractor or sub-contractor or supplier to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations could negatively impact our business and reputation and could result in fines, penalties, suspension or, in the case of government contracts, even debarment, which in turn could adversely impact our reputation and financial results. Although we seek to shift liability for contractor or sub-contractor underperformance, contract breach or damages to the specific contractor or sub-contractor via contract, such provisions may not always be effective, in particular where the contractor or sub-contractor in question is insolvent or otherwise unable to meet its obligations, or in jurisdictions where such contracts may not always be reliably enforced by local courts. Many jurisdictions also have laws regulating the treatment of contractors and sub-contractors, with which we must comply. See “—We are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the protection of the _environment, health and safety worldwide, compliance with which can be burdensome and non-compliance with which may result in substantial costs.” Dependence on distributors._ We are also dependent on third-party distributors for our sales in a number of jurisdictions. We have a global sales and services network covering a majority of the world’s countries. More than 60 countries are covered by our own field operations, whereas approximately 40 countries, most of which are in emerging markets, are served via distributors. In some countries, where we have our own field operations, we nonetheless use distributors as an additional sales channel. Our distributing partners sell our products and services either on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis. Although we believe that our distributors are properly incentivized to sell our products, there is no assurance that they will not favor a competitor’s products, particularly where we have a non-exclusive sales relationship with them, or that they will sell our products as effectively as our competitors sell their products in those markets, or that our distributors will always succeed in meeting our sales targets and other expectations. If our distributors fail to effectively sell our products, this could have a material adverse effect on our New Installations sales, and we could lose market share to our competitors in those markets.

In recent years, our most significant operating expenses have been on an upward trend, pressuring our profit margins. Our future success will therefore depend, in part, on our ability to implement operational improvement measures. Such measures could seek to simplify our product portfolio, increase manufacturing efficiency through restructuring production and optimize supply chains. They could also seek to reduce our SG&A expenses by streamlining management, centralizing administrative costs and improving IT systems. In developing our financial targets relating to sales growth and profitability, we have made certain assumptions about the financial impact that these operational improvement measures will have on our future financial results. However, there can be no assurance that these initiatives will yield the targeted benefits, or that they will not entail higher implementation costs than expected or take longer to implement than expected. In addition, the adjustments to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA annualizing the impact of certain cost saving measures and adding back expected synergies from certain operational improvement initiatives presented in this offering memorandum should be treated with caution when making an investment decision. The assumptions we have made with respect to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA that we present in this offering memorandum are based on our current estimates and they involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such adjusted financial information. Our anticipated cost 48 ----- saving and operational run-rate synergies are based upon assumptions about our ability to implement cost saving measures in a timely fashion and within certain cost parameters. Our ability to achieve planned cost saving and operational run-rate synergies is dependent upon a significant number of assumptions, some of which may be beyond our control, including the development of the markets for our products and services, political, legal, fiscal, market and economic conditions, regulatory developments, and tariff and wage increases. If one or more of our underlying assumptions regarding these measures proves to have been incorrect, these efforts could lead to substantially higher costs than planned and we may not be able to realize fully, or realize in the anticipated timeframe, the expected benefits from our cost saving and operational measures. In addition, cost saving and operational efficiencies from improved production processes may not be able to be sustained due to changes in customer needs, changes in regulations, availability and cost of materials or other cost variables. Our new business initiatives could also result in unintended consequences, such as the loss of key customers and suppliers and strikes and other industrial actions by our employees, which could undermine the benefits of the operational improvements by disrupting production and leading to different costs. Operational efficiency measures generally require a significant amount of management attention and resources, which may disrupt or otherwise have an adverse effect on our ongoing business operations. These factors may offset the cost savings we anticipate and which we have included in our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. Consequently, our inability to realize our anticipated cost savings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

Costs and contractual completion dates are based on many assumptions which include, in particular, the cost and availability of labor, equipment and materials, and can be adversely affected by local weather conditions, delays in the commencement of construction work, strikes or other work stoppages, quality problems with products and components, the timely performance of suppliers and sub-contractors or other third parties and unanticipated technical problems, among other events over which we may have no or only limited control. We have in the past borne time and cost overruns due to unforeseen reasons, including project-delay costs not chargeable to customers, and re-work issues and in some cases, suffer consequential contractual penalties.

These include electric and electronic components like traction machines and printed circuit board assembly, as well as mechanical components like guiderails, shaft/cabin doors, speed governors and escalator steps, among others. These components often contain raw materials such as steel, aluminum and rare earths (which are used in magnets), and therefore their price and availability is impacted by fluctuations in the underlying raw material costs. The cost of parts and components represents a significant portion of our total costs. Prices for raw materials, components and parts are susceptible to fluctuations, driven by global or regional supply/demand dynamics in commodity and end markets, production capacity constraints of suppliers, availability of certain materials, transportation costs, infrastructure failures, government regulations and tariffs, geopolitical events, changes in currency exchange rates, the economic climate and other factors. Price increases attributable to such price fluctuations, along with increasing transportation costs, can create pressure on our profit margins. If the prices of these parts and components increase in the future, and we are not able to at least partially pass such increases on to customers in the form of higher prices or otherwise mitigate costs, this could negatively affect our profitability. We do not hedge our exposure to raw material price increases. We are also subject to the risk of supply shortages for key raw materials used in our parts and components. A shortage of these could arise from increases in demand due to strong economic and market conditions, decreases in extraction and production due to natural disasters, political instability or unrest or production limits imposed in extracting and producing countries. For example, China, which is currently the predominant producer of rare earth elements, has limited the export of such elements in the past and is increasingly using other mechanisms, such as an export licensing system or the imposition of higher raw material duties, which has caused adverse price movements in the past and could limit access to such materials. Shortages in the availability of key parts and components due to shortages in the underlying raw materials may result in production shortfalls that could, if significant, result in the inability to fulfill customer orders and complete projects, and result in a loss of business 49 ----- volume.

Unforeseen disruption of a production facility could be caused by a number of events, including a maintenance outage, power or equipment failure, fires, floods, earthquakes or other natural disasters, social unrest or terrorist activity, work stoppages, public health concerns (including pandemics), regulatory measures or other operational problems. For instance, many of our manufacturing facilities experienced temporary shutdowns due to COVID-19 recently. Serious construction site accidents, particularly those resulting in fatalities, can lead to production disruptions and even lengthy work stoppages caused by regulatory or other official interventions. A prolonged disruption at a manufacturing facility could result in production downtimes or temporary operation at reduced capacity preventing us from completing production orders in a timely manner, loss of business volume, and reduced productivity or profitability at a particular production site. Even less severe problems involving our production facilities, such as missed shipment dates, split shipments, defective software or materials, or logistics problems, could lead to project delays or other problems in our New Installation business. It could also result in significant repair costs and, in severe cases, injuries or loss of life that are not or not completely covered by our insurance coverage.

For example, business generated from public or quasi-public entities may be affected by political and administrative decisions concerning levels of public spending or changes in governments and their economic policies. Decisions to decrease public spending or changes in priorities or other unforeseen issues may result in the termination or downscaling of public sector contracts, which could result in a loss of revenue and limit our recovery of incurred costs, reimbursable expenses and profits on work completed prior to the termination. Contractual non-compliance, failure to comply with procurement regulations and laws regarding the protection of classified information, violation of non-discrimination rules or environmental, health and safety regulations and other improper or illegal activities, may result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, exclusion from future tenders, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with the government. Government contracts are also often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity than other contracts.

For example, in May 2019, we announced the acquisition of Nashville Machine Elevator Co., Inc., followed in July by the announcement that we had acquired O’Keefe Elevator Company Inc., both in the United States. Corporate acquisitions and disposals are associated with significant risks. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates in the future. Even if we do identify a suitable acquisition candidate, we may not be able to finance such acquisition on favorable terms, if at all. Diligence reviews of acquisition targets may not identify all of the material issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost or potential loss contingencies with respect to a particular transaction, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target’s previous activities. We may incur unanticipated costs or expenses in connection with such transactions, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, litigation and other liabilities, including related to warranties. We may also encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations, applying our internal controls processes to these acquisitions or in managing strategic investments. Target companies may be located in countries in which the underlying legal, 50 ----- economic, political and cultural conditions do not correspond to those customary in our key areas of activity or have other national peculiarities with which we are not familiar. Moreover, any planned acquisition may be subject to review and approval by the competition and other regulatory authorities of a number of jurisdictions, which may impede a planned transaction. We may not realize the targets for growth, economies of scale, cost savings, development, production and distribution targets, or other strategic goals that we seek from the acquisition to the extent or in the timeframe anticipated, and the attention of management and other personnel may be diverted for long periods of time.

However, we conduct our business in a large number of countries across the globe and in several international currencies. In the years ended September 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, 77% of our net sales were generated by operating subsidiaries with a functional currency (generally the local currency) other than the euro. In terms of our results of operations, the US dollar, the Chinese renminbi, the Brazilian real, the Canadian dollar and the South Korean won are the most important foreign currencies. Any change in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the euro affects our reported results of operations and assets and liabilities when the results of those subsidiaries are translated into euro for reporting purposes. In preparing combined and consolidated financial statements, assets and liabilities of subsidiaries are translated into euro at the foreign exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Income statements of subsidiaries are translated to euro at the average exchange rates for the period. Accordingly, fluctuations in the value of other currencies against the euro reduce or increase these subsidiaries’ contribution to, among other things, our net sales and profit and thus also affect our statement of financial position. Among the factors that affect foreign exchange rates are trade balances, short-term interest rates, differences in relative values of similar assets in different currencies, long-term opportunities for investment and capital appreciation, and other macroeconomic and political developments, including deliberate manipulation by certain countries of their currencies. The exchange rates between the foreign currencies and the euro have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to do so in the future. Unfavorable fluctuations in the values of the currencies in which our international subsidiaries’ financial statements are prepared against the euro could have a material negative impact on our future consolidated financial statements. We are also exposed to transactional risk to the extent our subsidiaries and us execute transactions in a currency other than our functional currency, which arises mainly when we import components from one jurisdiction, incurring a cost in that jurisdiction’s currency, and invoice for our products and installation in the local currency. Our transactional risk exposure is less significant than our translation risk exposure, because we produce and install our products predominantly in our key markets, which generally has the effect of matching the currencies of our costs with those of our sales. Nonetheless, adverse exchange rate movements can impact the profitability of our New Installation business and, to a lesser degree, the Modernization business, to the extent key imported components become more expensive in our local sales areas. We generally manage our transactional foreign currency risk related to booked transactions through different foreign exchange hedging strategies, mainly consisting of derivative foreign exchange instruments and split currency sales contracts. There can be no assurance that we can always enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms, that such arrangements will be available at all times when we wish to use them, that the relevant over-the-counter counterparty will always be able to fulfill our contractual obligations or that these strategies will be sufficient to effectively mitigate the transactional foreign exchange risks described above.

In particular, we have significant operations in mainland China and derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese customers. As a consequence, we are increasingly subject to economic and political risks in mainland China, as well as certain Chinese laws and regulations regarding foreign-invested enterprises, including foreign currency exchange rules. Moreover, as laws and regulations in mainland China are gradually evolving, there may be uncertainty in their interpretation and enforcement. The administrative and court authorities in China have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory terms. Thus, it may be more difficult for us to evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings in China, should they arise, than in other systems. Our overall success as a global business depends to a considerable extent on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage differing legal, political, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions and unforeseeable developments.

Furthermore, we may become subject to proceedings by governmental authorities in connection with our compliance with laws and regulatory requirements, including in the areas of antitrust, tax, environmental and safety matters. For example, we have in the past been fined a total of €319.8 million by the European Commission for violation of EU antitrust rules and currently face private enforcement claims in relation to our participation in elevator cartels in several EU jurisdictions, the current total value of the claims being approximately €150 million. See “—We are exposed to legal risks regarding antitrust _regulation and related enforcement actions and damage claims.” In addition, four fatal accidents in South Korea_ resulting in the deaths of five employees from consortium partners of our South Korean subsidiary have led to criminal and administrative proceedings for alleged violation of various health and safety-related rules, as well as construction industry and elevator regulations in connection with the use of sub-contractors. The alleged 52 ----- violations of health and safety and construction industry regulations may result in the imposition of monetary fines and a suspension of the New Installation business license in South Korea for a period of time ranging from several months to, in a worst case scenario, a much longer period, depending on the final outcome of the proceedings. The alleged violations of the elevator regulations could result in monetary fines as well as suspension of our Service business license in South Korea for at least two years. In addition, we could suffer reputational damage in South Korea as a consequence of the proceedings. Although we do not anticipate lengthy suspensions of the New Installation or Service business licenses to be a likely outcome of the proceedings, there is no guarantee that this will prove to be correct.

In addition, antitrust rules and regulations in certain jurisdictions may impose restrictions on our ability to carry out certain acquisitions, enter into joint ventures, or require forced divestments or the implementation of other measures. The elevator technology industry has seen heightened scrutiny by antitrust authorities in recent years and we have faced, and may in the future face, significant antitrust enforcement actions. In 2007, the European Commission imposed fines on thyssenkrupp AG, the Target’s holding company, and its affiliates as well as other global elevator manufacturers for participation in cartels for the installation and maintenance of lifts and escalators in Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands in violation of EU antitrust rules. The European Commission decision cited impermissible restrictive business practices, including rigged bids for procurement contracts, price fixing, allocation of projects among competitors, and the exchange of business secrets and other confidential information, among other offenses. thyssenkrupp AG and its subsidiaries were fined €479.7 million in 2007, an amount that was subsequently reduced to €319.8 million. We avoided a fine from similar investigations by the Austrian Federal Competition Authority by acting as a crown witness. Private enforcement claims in connection with these matters have been filed both in and out of court against thyssenkrupp AG and its subsidiaries in a number of jurisdictions, including Belgium, Austria and the Netherlands. The claimants allege that the cartel led to cartel overcharges and umbrella damages in relation to sales by third-party competitors not participating in the cartel, the total value of the claims being approximately €150 million plus interest. Our indemnity under the Share Purchase Agreement for these claims is capped to €29 million and is only applicable for existing claims.

Approximately 4,751 of our 52,567 employees as of March 31, 2020 enjoy some form of special protection against dismissal based on contractual commitments which are contained in, inter alia, collective agreements (in particular, the “Future Elevator” agreement concluded in March 2020), which means that ordinary dismissals of these employees are in general not possible or, depending on the scope of the additional protection, are subject to special requirements. These commitments are over and above the requirements under applicable labor laws. For example, in March 2020, thyssenkrupp Elevator concluded a collective bargaining agreement “Future Elevator” with German IG Metall in connection with the Acquisition. The “Future Elevator” collective bargaining agreement excludes forced redundancies (Ausschluss betriebsbedingter Beendigungskündigungen) and site guarantees (Standortsicherungszusagen) for the German production and essential service sites and is valid until March 31, 2027. Further, we also have in place a collective agreement including a site guarantee (Standortsicherungszusage) for the site in Neuhausen (Germany) until September 30, 2022. In addition, we have in place collective agreements excluding ordinary dismissals (Beschäftigungssicherung) for Neuhausen until September 30, 2022 and for 390 employees of the German field organization until September 30, 2026, with an option to terminate the agreement on September 30, 2022. Any restructuring or reorganizational measures, including the commercial operations cost savings measures that we succeed in carrying out as part of the Transformation Program, may strain relations with employees and their representatives. This may make it more difficult for us to subsequently negotiate, renew or extend collective agreements in a favorable and timely manner. We may also become subject to new collective agreements, which may increase our operating costs. In addition, our competitors may obtain competitive advantages compared to us, if they succeed in negotiating collective wage agreements or other collective agreements on more favorable terms and conditions. Any failure to negotiate wages and other key employment conditions that are reasonable and fair from our perspective could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. 54 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

Further, we are also dependent on personnel that are highly skilled and qualified in scientific, mechanical and technical fields. In some jurisdictions, the technicians servicing our products are required by local regulations to have special qualifications, limiting the supply of such technicians. In the United States, a shortage in qualified technicians has already led to hiring constraints and in the Asia/Pacific market, technicians typically need to receive extensive in-house training before they can start servicing our products. Our success in attracting and retaining such personnel depends on a variety of factors, including the supply of qualified candidates in the relevant market, as well as our compensation and benefit programs, work environment, career development opportunities, commitment to diversity and public image. These factors may pose greater risks in connection with the Reorganization and the Acquisition. Competition for qualified personnel is increasing.

Under IFRS, we are required to annually test our recorded goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and to assess the carrying values of other intangible assets when impairment indicators exist. Because of such tests, we could be required to recognize impairment losses in our income statement, if the carrying value is in excess of the fair value or value in use. Factors that could trigger an impairment of such assets include the underperformance of our business relative to projected future operating results, negative industry developments or economic trends, including changes in borrowing rates or weighted average cost of capital, applicable tax rates or changes in working capital.

As of March 31, 2020, our accrued pension obligations amounted to €319 million. The valuation and development of the defined benefit obligation under these plans depends, among other factors, upon agreed contributions rates, future asset performance, longevity and the actuarial profile of the plan participants, level of interest rates used to calculate future liabilities, actuarial assumptions and experience, effectiveness of amendments made to the benefit plans and government regulations and potential court rulings in relation to the plan administration and the calculation. Depending on these variables, future cash funding requirements for our pension plans and other long-term employee related benefit plans could be significantly higher than the amounts estimated as of March 31, 2020, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or prospects. If the market value of the plan assets decreases, we may also have to substantially increase our pension provisions. For example, fluctuations in currency, interest rates, actuarial assumptions and changes in the valuation of any funding assets may adversely affect the net liabilities for pension plans and similar plans providing for long-term employee related benefits or, in the case of multi-employer plans like the National Elevator Industry Pension Plan, the failure of any of the key contributing employers to make adequate contributions may adversely affect the value of the plan assets. In such event, we may have to cover the shortfall of funding assets or face significant additional funding obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our net assets, financial position and results of operations. Any significant increase in the present value of our pension and other obligations related to employee benefits and/or significant decrease in the fair value of the plan assets for a funding of the obligations, could have a material adverse effect on our net assets, financial position and results of operations. 55 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

In addition, our products, services and systems contain increasingly complex IT. The consistent, efficient and secure operation of IT is therefore critical to the successful performance of our operations and the products, services and systems we sell. Despite IT maintenance and security measures, our IT systems and networks are exposed to the risk of malfunctions and interruptions from a variety of sources, including equipment damage, deficient database design, power outages, computer viruses and a range of other hardware, software and network problems. We have experienced temporary outages in our IT systems in the past. The occurrence of any of these events could compromise the operational integrity of these systems and networks. In the case of technology included in our products, services and systems, malfunctions and disruptions could impact their functionality and jeopardize the safety of users such as elevator passengers. The risk in this respect is heightened as we increasingly sell digitally enhanced products, systems and services. In addition, our IT systems have in the past, been the target of cyber-attacks. For instance, in 2016, cyberattackers gained access to our IT systems, following which we undertook a complex remediation project to improve our systems. Further, in November 2018, a data center in Spain, of which we were a customer, was subject to a cyber-attack, leading to a shutdown of the center’s Internet connection over a weekend. We implement mitigation measures from time to time, as we identify new threats and risks. We cannot assure you that such measures will be effective or that breaches or other cyber-attacks, including industrial espionage or ransomware attacks will not occur in the future. Failure to effectively prevent, detect and remediate security breaches, including attacks on our IT infrastructure by hackers, viruses, employee error or misconduct, or other disruptions could seriously harm our operations and the operations of our customers. Such breaches may result, among other things, in unauthorized access to trade secrets, confidential business information and personal information, data losses, business interruptions, non-compliance with legal requirements, legal claims or proceedings, deterioration in customer relationships and reputational harm. Our shift to using cloud-based maintenance tools in our Service business could amplify the risk of such breaches, since providers of cloud-based products and services have been and are expected to continue to be targeted, and providers of remote connectivity services may be particularly attractive to attackers. Any disruptions of our IT systems, including as a result of cyber-attacks and industrial espionage, may disrupt operations, result in legal liability or reduce the competitive advantage we seek to derive from our investment in advanced technologies.

We have incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial costs in complying with these laws and regulations. Our operations involve a number of occupational health and safety risks. For example, our employees and sub-contractors who install or maintain our elevator technology products in the field, where they sometimes work 56 ----- at significant heights or at hazardous construction sites, have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, injuries and fatalities. We continuously monitor our health and safety record and continue to implement safety and health measures to comply with applicable health and safety regulations. Notwithstanding the preventive measures that we have already taken, or may take in the future, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective in reducing the number of incidents, and any such incidents may result in disruption to our New Installation, Service and Modernization businesses, as well as legal and regulatory consequences and reputational damage. For example, see “Business—Legal Proceedings—Criminal and administrative proceedings _against thyssenkrupp Elevator Korea Ltd.”._ In the area of environmental regulation, our operations are required to comply with laws and regulations relating to air, water and noise pollution, laws regulating greenhouse gas emissions, toxic and other chemicals and materials, waste treatment and disposal methods, and the energy efficiency of production processes, among other things, in various jurisdictions in which we operate. We are also subject to periodic monitoring by environmental protection authorities in various jurisdictions. Any failure on our part to comply with any present or future environmental regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us, suspension of production or a loss of license to operate certain facilities. In addition, customers increasingly scrutinize the labor and environmental standards of industrial companies, particularly in emerging markets. Additional, more stringent social responsibility and anti-discrimination laws, regulations and practices may be adopted in the future, which may result in an increase in our cost of compliance. In addition, if we fail to comply with such laws, regulations and practices, we may be subject to fines, penalties, legal judgments, customer boycotts or other measures, which may adversely affect our reputation, operating results and financial condition. A finding of non-compliance, or the perception that we have not responded appropriately to growing consumer concern for issues relating to social responsibility, whether or not we are legally required to do so, may adversely affect our business and reputation.

These economic sanctions restrict our ability to engage in business dealings with certain countries and persons. Currently, we have direct and indirect business activities in Russia and Myanmar and indirect business activities in Iraq, Belarus, Ivory Coast, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Lebanon, Ukraine, Venezuela and Zimbabwe. All of these countries are subject, to varying degrees, to economic sanctions. However, we conduct restricted party screening of both direct and indirect business counterparties and, insofar as we are aware, have not engaged in any business with any persons targeted by list-based sanctions administered by the United Nations, the European Union, or the United States. We have not engaged in any new direct or indirect business dealings with Iran or Libya since 2018 and 2019, respectively. We are still subject to certain warranty liabilities via our former distributors stemming from historical business in these countries. Furthermore, as of March 2020, we have stopped all new business dealings with Cuba and Sudan, although we are still subject to certain warranty liabilities via our former distributors stemming from historical business in these countries. Our entities and personnel are also subject to various anti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010. In addition, our entities and personnel are subject to anti-money-laundering laws and regulations, including the general, non-regulated sector provisions of the EU’s 5th Money-Laundering Directive, which came into force in 2018. Some of the countries in which we operate and make sales are perceived to have higher levels of corruption. Our geographical diversification (including in emerging markets), joint ventures, other business relationships, and employment of local agents, dealers and distributors in the countries where we operate increases our risk of violating applicable anti-corruption laws, economic sanctions, and anti-money laundering laws. Violation of such laws and regulations can be punishable by criminal penalties, civil fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts (and termination of existing contracts), and revocations or restrictions of licenses. In addition, violations of these laws could impact our reputation, and, consequently, on our ability to win future business and maintain long-term commercial relationships with our customers. 57 ----- Economic sanctions, anti-corruption laws, and anti-money-laundering laws change over time. It is difficult for us to predict how these laws will change in the future or impact our business. While we have adopted and continuously review compliance policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including applicable export controls, economic sanctions, anti-corruption laws, and anti-money laundering laws, there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be followed at all times or that our internal controls will effectively detect and prevent all violations of applicable law by our employees, consultants, agents or partners.

However, there can be no certainty that our internal controls, procedures, compliance systems and risk management systems will be able to identify such violations, ensure that they are reported in a timely manner, evaluate them correctly or take the appropriate countermeasures, and that they will be adequate for an enterprise of our scale and complexity. For instance, issues regarding local book keeping and financial reporting processes led to qualified, adverse or disclaimer of opinions on the financial information of certain entities of the Elevator Technology Business’s Operating Unit Spanish Latin America in several instances as of September 30, 2018 and 2017 and for the financial years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017. It was revealed that certain individuals in the local accounting and reporting teams of the Elevator Technology Business’s Operating Unit Spanish Latin America requested and made adjustments based on best estimates to figures representing cash and cash equivalents as well as other balance sheet positions, profit and loss positions and Group KPIs, such as EBIT and business cash flow without documentation properly justifying those adjustments. It was determined that the adjustments were made at least partially as a result of the long working hours and high turnover rate in the relevant accounting and controlling departments, the complexity within local reporting systems and processes and a lack of formal control and procedures in the relevant departments. As a result, our management has made certain adjustments to the financial information for the periods affected based on their best estimates. For more information and a list of these adjustments, see Note 1 of the Audited Combined Financial Statements and the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and “Presentation _of Financial Information—Historical Financial Information.” However, the independent auditor’s report on the_ Audited Combined Financial Statements is qualified since the auditor was not able to obtain sufficient information and evidence required to assess the existence, completeness, valuation and cut-off of the assets and liabilities of these entities as of September 30, 2018 and 2017 as well as the income and expense for the financial years ended September 30, 2019, 2018, 2017 of these entities.

Moreover, in light of continuously evolving legal and regulatory requirements, and internal developments such as corporate reorganizations, there can be no certainty that our risk management systems, internal controls and compliance systems and related governance structures will adequately identify and address all relevant requirements. Any failure to effectively prevent, identify or address violations of our legal obligations as a result of inadequate internal controls, procedures, compliance systems and risk management systems could result in penalties and other sanctions, liabilities, the assertion of damages claims by third parties, and reputational damage, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition or prospects. 58 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

In particular: - The Target’s Management Board may not operate the business of the Target until the Acquisition Closing Date in the same way that the Issuers and the Sponsors would. - Much of the information contained in this offering memorandum relating to the Target had to be derived from public sources and, in the case of certain additional information relating to the Target, has been provided to the Issuers by the Target, and the Issuers have relied on such information that is publicly available or was supplied to them by the Target in their preparation of this offering memorandum. - The Acquisition has required, and will likely continue to require, substantial time and focus from the Target’s management, which could adversely affect their ability to operate the Target’s business. Likewise, employees may be uncomfortable with the Acquisition. - In addition, the Target’s Management Board is required to manage the business of the Target under its own responsibility and in a manner that is in the best interest of the Target. - Prior to the Acquisition Closing Date and until the change of the Target’s legal form into a Gesellschaft mit _beschränkter Haftung, the Issuers cannot assure you that the Target will fully comply with the covenants_ described in “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” and “Description of the Senior Notes” to be included in the Indentures, due to statutory limitations on the influence of shareholders on a public German stock corporation. As such, we cannot assure you that, prior to such date and such change in legal form, the Target and its subsidiaries will not take any action that would otherwise have been prohibited by the Indentures had those covenants been applicable. We cannot assure you that the Acquisition will be consummated given it is dependent on a number of closing conditions, including receipt of antitrust and regulatory approvals. If we are not able to satisfy or waive these conditions, as applicable, the Acquisition Closing Date will not occur and the Acquisition will not be consummated.

The objective of the due diligence process is to identify attractive investment opportunities based on the facts and circumstances of an investment, to identify possible risks associated with that investment and to prepare a framework that may be used from the date of an acquisition to drive operational achievement and value creation. When conducting due diligence, the Sponsors typically evaluate a number of important business, financial, tax, accounting, environmental and legal issues in determining whether or not to proceed with an investment. Outside consultants, legal advisors, accountants and investment banks are involved in the due diligence process in varying degrees depending on the type of investment. Nevertheless, when conducting due diligence and making an assessment regarding an investment, the Sponsors rely on resources available to them, including information provided by the target of the investment and, in some circumstances, third party investigations. Instances of bribery, fraud, accounting irregularities, contingent liabilities and other improper, illegal or corrupt practices can be difficult to detect, and fraud and other deceptive practices can be widespread in certain jurisdictions. There may be liabilities that the Sponsors failed or were unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations into the Target and its subsidiaries in connection with the Acquisition. Following the Acquisition, we may learn of additional information about the Target and/or any of its subsidiaries that adversely affect us, such as unknown or contingent liabilities and issues relating to compliance with applicable laws. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. We cannot be certain that the Sponsors’ due diligence investigation has revealed or highlighted all relevant facts (including fraud, bribery and other illegal activities and contingent liabilities) that may be necessary or helpful in evaluating the merits of investing in the Target.

The operating elevator companies were held by different companies of the thyssenkrupp Group. Substantial parts of the elevator business were bundled under thyssenkrupp Elevator Innovation which directly or indirectly held all German elevator companies, as well as certain foreign elevator companies and performed holding functions for the Elevator Technology Business. The remaining foreign elevator companies not bundled under thyssenkrupp Elevator Innovation were held by various foreign companies of the thyssenkrupp Group. To achieve a complete legal separation of all elevator companies from the other parts of the remaining thyssenkrupp Group and enable the Acquisition, various measures and share transfers were implemented to reorganize the thyssenkrupp Group and to bundle all elevator companies under the Target. As a consequence, past events that are described in the Offering Memorandum as having occurred with respect to the Group reflect events that occurred before the Target existed as a stand-alone business, and may not be indicative of events that will occur following the Acquisition, when the Target operates a stand-alone business. It is therefore difficult to assess the applicability or magnitude of risks disclosed in the Offering Memorandum given that such risks are based on the performance of the various operating elevator companies when they were 62 ----- operating as part of the thyssenkrupp Group rather than as part of a separate, stand-alone legal or reporting entity. Similarly, it is difficult to predict our future performance following the Acquisition, given that the historical financial information for the Elevator Technology Business as presented in this offering memorandum reflects periods that have occurred prior to the Target’s separation from the thyssenkrupp Group. The measures and share transfers implemented to reorganize the thyssenkrupp Group and to bundle all elevator companies under the Target may also have tax effects on the Target and the elevator companies. Given the substantial value of the Target and the elevator companies and the complexity of the measures taken, taxes relating to those measures could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

It formed part of a larger group of companies controlled by thyssenkrupp AG and was reported as a segment within the consolidated financial statements of thyssenkrupp AG. In order to facilitate the Acquisition, the Reorganization was completed on December 31, 2019. Consequently, the Audited Combined Financial Statements were prepared to reflect the Elevator Technology Business as historically included in the IFRS consolidated financial statements of thyssenkrupp AG. Such combined financial statements are, however, subject to certain limitations. For example, in order to reflect the assets, liabilities, income, taxes and expenses that fall within the scope of the Group, various combination rules as well as a series of assumptions and estimates have been applied. Our management used significant judgement in determining these combination rules, assumptions and estimates, which may prove to be inaccurate or inapplicable to the Group on a stand-alone basis. For example, our statement of profit or loss for the three financial years presented in the Audited Combined Financial Statements include central cost allocations from thyssenkrupp Group, comprising our share of thyssenkrupp AG’s overhead costs for the relevant year. However, the Group does not consider these costs to be representative of the standalone costs it will bear following the Acquisition. As a result of the foregoing, the Audited Combined Financial Statements contained in the Offering Memorandum do not necessarily reflect the results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the Group if it had existed as a separate reporting group in the periods presented.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

These services include, among others, accounting services, IT, procurement, intellectual property, treasury and financing, human resources, legal and compliance. Following the Acquisition, thyssenkrupp Group will continue to provide a reduced selection of these services to the Group, including services such as accounting and risk services, IT, procurement, real estate, human resources, compliance tax (in certain jurisdictions) and other related functions, under the New TSAs and the Additional Service Agreements, for a transitional period from the Acquisition Closing Date. The Group expects that it will be dependent on these services provided by the thyssenkrupp Group, for the duration of the agreements pursuant to which they will be provided. For more information see “Certain Relationships and _Related Party Transactions—Services provided by the thyssenkrupp Group to the Group—Ongoing Relationships and Services Provided by the thyssenkrupp Group—Transitional Service Agreements (“TSAs”).”_ It is possible that such ongoing service relationships and agreements will be insufficient to cover our needs as a stand-alone company or that the agreements pursuant to which they are provided may contain terms and conditions that are not favorable to the Group or not competitive with alternatives in the market.

See “—The Target’s _corporate structure has undergone substantial organizational changes in the context of the carve-out and separation from the thyssenkrupp Group, making it very challenging to transparently assess past and future Group performance and legal risks.”_ In the United States, certain steps were implemented to allow for a transfer of the US entities of the Group (indirectly) to the Target. Such steps included the transfer of the US entities belonging to the remaining thyssenkrupp Group, which previously had been held by thyssenkrupp Elevator USA Holding Corp. to a German entity that is part of the remaining thyssenkrupp Group via a share distribution (the “US Distribution”). The US Distribution is expected to be treated as a taxable distribution to thyssenkrupp Elevator USA Holding Corp., such that it is expected to recognize income for US federal and applicable state and local income tax purposes in connection with the US Distribution. However, the members of the Group are also expected to have sufficient net operating losses available to offset such income, such that there is not expected to be a remaining corporate-level US federal income cash tax liability as a result of such gain recognition. There is a risk that state or local taxes may be imposed on the Group on any gain incurred in connection with the US Distribution to the extent there are insufficient state or local net operating losses to offset the gain that is taxable for the relevant state or local tax purposes. The US Distribution might also raise potential US withholding tax issues. However, thyssenkrupp AG has received tax advice to the effect that the US Distribution should not be subject to withholding taxes in the United States. Nonetheless, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) could assert that the US Distribution is subject to US withholding taxes or other taxes. If the IRS were successful in taking this position, the Group could be subject to significant US federal income withholding tax liability. The reorganization of the thyssenkrupp Group may have other tax consequences in the United States, or in a broad range of other jurisdictions, due to the global nature of our business. Among other things, it is anticipated that indirect transfers of shares (i.e. where shares in the shareholder of a specific entity are transferred) may be subject to tax in various jurisdictions where the Group conducts business. thyssenkrupp AG would be required, pursuant to the provisions of the Share Purchase Agreement, to bear any cash taxes relating to the reorganization of the thyssenkrupp Group (including US federal, state and local income taxes, any US federal income withholding taxes arising from the US Distribution and, to a certain extent, indirect transfer taxes in various jurisdictions where the Group conducts business, as described above), subject to certain exclusions and limitations. Should thyssenkrupp AG not have sufficient funds to settle its indemnification obligation vis-a-vis the Target, such liability would have to be borne by the Group, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and prospects. Although the Group believes its tax estimates and positions with respect to its potential tax liability are reasonable, the final determination of any such taxes is made by tax authorities, whose views could differ from the estimates and positions of the Group.

Following consummation of the Acquisition, the Issuers will be 65 ----- dependent upon the cash flow from their operating subsidiaries in the form of dividends or other distributions or payments to meet their obligations, including their obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees. Given the Group’s international operations, it has a large number of operating subsidiaries and business participations, which individually contribute to our Group’s results. The amounts of dividends and distributions available to the Issuers will depend on the profitability and cash flows of their subsidiaries and the ability of each of those subsidiaries to declare dividends under applicable law or transfer profits under profit and loss transfer agreements, if applicable. The Issuers’ subsidiaries, however, may not be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable law to, make distributions or advance upstream loans to the Issuers to make payments in respect of their indebtedness, including the Notes and the Note Guarantees. Various agreements governing our debt may restrict and, in some cases may actually prohibit, the ability of these subsidiaries to move cash within their restricted group. In particular, the Senior Facilities and the Senior Secured Notes limit the ability to upstream cash to the SUN Issuer subject to certain exceptions. Applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to further taxation. Applicable law as well as profit and loss transfer agreements between several entities of the Group may also limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or even prevent such payments. In particular, the ability of the Issuers’ subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Issuers will generally be limited to the amount of distributable reserves available to each of them and the ability to pay their respective debt when due. The Target is organized under German law which provides that dividends may only be distributed out of current profits and distributable reserves, and, generally, interim dividend distributions are not allowed under German law.

We have the ability to borrow up to €1,000 million (equivalent) under our Revolving Credit Facility and up to €1,000 million (equivalent) in guarantees under our Guarantee Facility, which will be secured, in each case, by the SSN Collateral, and the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Indentures also permit the incurrence of additional debt thereunder. The Indentures and the Senior Facilities Agreement also permit us to incur a substantial amount of indebtedness at subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes and to incur indebtedness that shares in the Collateral or that benefits from security interests over assets that do not secure the Notes.

Subject to certain requirements, the German interest barrier rules impose certain restrictions on the deductibility of interest expense for German tax purposes. The German interest barrier rules generally provide for a limitation on the deduction of net interest expenses in excess of 30% of tax adjusted EBITDA. For purposes of the interest barrier rules, all entities that are part of the same fiscal unity (Organschaft) for corporate income and trade tax purposes are treated as one single business. Any non-deductible amount exceeding the threshold of 30% is carried forward and may be, again subject to the interest barrier rules, deductible in future financial years. Any interest carryforward may be forfeited in part or in full in connection with certain measures, 66 ----- such as a change of the ownership structure. Upon closing of the Acquisition, certain Group companies may forfeit their existing interest carryforwards on the Acquisition Closing Date. Furthermore, on June 20, 2016, the European Council adopted the Directive (EU) 2016/1164 laying down rules against tax avoidance practices that directly affect the functioning of the internal market. The Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive contains five legally binding anti abuse measures, which all member states will be required to apply against common forms of aggressive tax planning from January 1, 2017 onwards. Part of the package of measures is the implementation of an interest limitation in line with German rules. The restriction of the deductibility of interest expenses for tax purposes may have adverse consequences for our financial position and results of operations. The European Council has also adopted Directive (EU) 2017/952 (ATAD II) targeting mismatches which needed to be implemented by December 31, 2019, but have not been enacted in Germany to date. The German ministry of finance issued a new draft bill on the implementation of the aforementioned directives on December 10, 2019, and published an update of such draft bill on March 24, 2020. Amongst others, according to this draft bill, expenditures for intercompany financing may be disallowed in the current and future tax periods. The draft bill intends to broaden the existing rules on corresponding inclusions and deductions of income and expenses and introduces provisions to counter tax shortfalls due to mismatches from the use of hybrid financial instruments or hybrid entities or due to dual tax residency and, furthermore, introduces new arm’s length provisions on intercompany financing that may ultimately limit the deduction of interest expenses on intercompany loans. If the draft bill is enacted and depending on the final wording of the new legislation, the introduction of aforesaid rules could result in higher taxable income and a higher tax burden for corporate income tax and trade tax purposes in the current and future tax periods. Further measures may follow as part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project. The use of existing or future tax loss carryforwards and ongoing losses for German corporate income and trade tax purposes may be forfeited in case of a direct or indirect transfer of shares, subject to certain limited exceptions. Such restriction, applying to both corporate income and trade tax, depends on the percentage of share capital or voting rights transferred within a five year period to one acquirer or person(s) closely related to the acquirer or a group of acquirers with a common interest. Under current rules, if more than 50% of the share capital or voting rights are transferred to such an acquirer, tax loss carryforwards and current losses will be forfeited to the extent no exception from the general forfeiture rules can be applied, such as the built-in gains exemption pursuant to which tax loss carryforwards survive to the extent taxable built-in gains are available at the level of the loss-carrying entity. The German Federal Constitutional Court, in a decision dated March 29, 2017 and published May 12, 2017, has held that the German tax loss forfeiture rules, in a version which was effective from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2015, violate the German constitution to the extent they stipulate a partial forfeiture of a company’s current and carried forward tax losses upon a transfer of more than 25% but less than 50% of its shares. According to this decision, the German legislator is required to amend the current tax loss forfeiture rules in respect of the aforementioned period and transfer of shares, so they are consistent with the German constitution. Meanwhile, the German legislator has made changes to the relevant provisions of German law with the effect, that a transfer of more than 25% but less than 50% of the shares does not have the consequences that losses are forfeited. However, currently, another proceeding is pending at the German Federal Constitutional Court regarding whether forfeiture upon ownership changes of more than 50% is constitutional. To the extent that the utilization of tax losses is restricted, they cannot be set off against future tax profits which would result in higher future tax burdens compared to the situation in which tax loss carryforwards can be used to lower the actual tax burden on profits. Such restriction may require a write down of the deferred tax assets in our consolidated financial statements and would negatively affect our financial position and results of operations. Furthermore, upon the creation of a fiscal unity for German corporate and trade tax purposes, any tax loss carryforwards and interest carry forwards for German corporate income and trade tax purposes of a subsidiary, which have been incurred before the creation of the fiscal unity, will be excluded from use for the duration of the fiscal unity.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that currently anticipated growth, cost savings or efficiencies will be realized or that future debt financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs including the repayment at maturity of the then outstanding amount under the Senior Facilities. At the maturity of the Senior Facilities (including the Revolving Credit Facility and the Guarantee Facility, which mature six months before the Senior Secured Notes and 18 months before the Senior Notes), the Notes or any other debt that we may incur, if we do not have sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital resources to pay our debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be required to refinance or restructure our indebtedness. If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to: - sell assets; 68 ----- - obtain additional debt or equity capital; or - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity. The type, timing and terms of any future financing, restructuring, asset sales or other capital raising transactions will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay any portion or all of our debt. Any failure to make payments on the Notes on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the terms of our debt, including the Notes and the Senior Facilities, will limit, and any future debt may limit, our ability to pursue any of these alternatives. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business, financial position and results of operations. There can be no assurances that any assets that we could be required to dispose of could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of proceeds realized from such sale would be acceptable.

The SSN EUR FRN Notes will also bear interest at a variable rate based on EURIBOR (subject to a zero floor if less than zero) plus an applicable margin. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes. Neither the Senior Facilities Agreement nor the Indentures contain a covenant requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our floating rate debt. Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to rise significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow. Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, a different measure of interbank lending rates, regulators and law enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union are conducting investigations into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily EURIBOR or the calculation of LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate EURIBOR and LIBOR. In addition, LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” are the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, which entered into force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. For example, on July 27, 2017, the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021 (the “FCA Announcement”). The FCA Announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. The potential elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or LIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including but not limited to the Senior Facilities whose interest rates are linked to LIBOR and EURIBOR). Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest. In addition, on November 29, 2017, the Bank of England and the FCA announced that the market working group on Sterling Risk-Free Rates would have an extended mandate to catalyze a broad transition to the Sterling Over Night Index Average Rate (“SONIA”) across sterling bond, loan and derivatives markets so that SONIA is 69 ----- established as the primary sterling interest rate benchmark by the end of 2021. The Bank of England and FCA have stated that a key near-term priority for the working group will be to make recommendations relating to the potential development of SONIA reference rates. A public consultation was launched in July 2018 in relation to specific queries related to the operations of SONIA reference rates. On April 23, 2018, the Bank of England took over administration of SONIA and issued a series of reforms as part of its implementation as a replacement to LIBOR. From April 2018, the Bank of England has been setting the interest rate benchmark using SONIA, meaning that banks are no longer compelled by the FCA to submit LIBOR rates beyond 2021. These reforms and other pressures may cause such benchmarks to disappear entirely, to perform differently than in the past (as a result of a change in methodology or otherwise), create disincentives for market participants to continue to administer or participate in certain benchmarks or have other consequences which cannot be predicted.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

No appraisal of the value of the SSN Collateral has been made in connection with this Offering. The value of the assets underlying the pledges will also depend on many factors, including, among other things, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale and the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers. The shares and other SSN Collateral that will be pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Senior Secured Notes, in part because most of such collateral may not be liquid and its value to other parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the SSN Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Industry regulations in certain jurisdictions in which we operate, such as Germany, include restrictions on persons who may hold certain of our licenses, authorizations and consents that are necessary to operate our business. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of our business operations may be prohibited or only permitted to a limited group of investors eligible to hold such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, entry into the Security Documents, enforcement of the SSN Collateral and any transfer of our operations may require, in certain jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings or might otherwise be challenged. Such consents, approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all.

Most of our assets do not secure the Senior Secured Notes and it is possible that the value of the SSN Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness secured by such SSN Collateral. With respect to any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to secure the Senior Secured Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof, such shares may also have limited value in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of the SSN Collateral may decline over time.

See “Description of the Senior Notes—Security.” In addition, a portion of the SUN Collateral, the Shared Collateral, will also secure the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Facilities on a first ranking basis, and may secure additional debt ranking senior to or pari passu with the Senior Notes and the Senior Note Guarantees. The SUN Collateral will also secure the Private Senior Notes on a pari passu basis with the Senior Notes and the Senior Note Guarantees. Although the pledge over the shares of the SUN Issuer will secure the Senior Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof on a first priority basis and will not secure the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Facilities, such pledge may secure additional debt ranking pari passu with the Senior Notes, to the extent permitted by the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The rights of the holders may therefore be diluted by any increase in the debt secured by the SUN Collateral or a reduction of the SUN Collateral securing the Senior Notes. In addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the proceeds of an enforcement of the SSN Collateral will be applied in repayment of any Super Senior Liabilities (to the extent the Designation Date has occurred), followed by (or unless the Designation Date has not occurred) the Senior Secured Notes and any lenders under the Senior Facilities, among others, before repayment of the Senior Notes and Senior Note Guarantees. To the extent the claims of the holders of the Senior Notes exceed the value of the SUN Collateral securing the Senior Notes and the Senior Note Guarantees, those claims will generally rank equally with the claims of the holders of all other existing and future senior debt ranking pari passu with the Senior Notes and the Senior Note Guarantees. As a result, if the value of the assets pledged as SUN Collateral is less than the value of the claims of the holders of the Senior Notes, those claims may not be satisfied in full. In addition, not all of our assets will secure the Senior Notes, and the Senior Notes Indenture will allow the SUN Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to secure certain types of debt permitted to be incurred under the Senior Notes Indenture (which may be structurally senior to the Senior Notes and the Senior Note Guarantees) with the property and assets of the restricted subsidiaries that do not secure the Senior Notes. The value of such assets and property could be significant. If an event of default occurs and the obligations under the Senior Notes are accelerated, the Senior Notes and the Senior Note Guarantees will not benefit from the assets securing such 75 ----- secured debt and will rank equally with the holders of unsecured debt of the SUN Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries with respect to any property or assets that is excluded from the SUN Collateral securing the Senior Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

In the event of an enforcement of the pledges in respect of the Senior Notes, the proceeds from the sale of the assets underlying the pledges may not be sufficient to satisfy the SUN Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Senior Notes including due to the reasons described in the preceding sentence. No appraisal of the value of the SUN Collateral has been made in connection with this Offering. The value of the assets underlying the pledges will also depend on many factors, including, among other things, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale and the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers. The SUN Collateral that is pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Senior Notes, in part because most of such collateral may not be liquid and its value to other parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the SUN Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Industry regulations in certain jurisdictions in which we operate, such as Germany, include restrictions on persons who may hold certain of our licenses, authorizations and consents that are necessary to operate our business. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of our business operations may be prohibited or only permitted to a limited group of investors eligible to hold such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, entry into the Security Documents, enforcement of the SUN Collateral and any transfer of our operations may require, in certain jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings or might otherwise be challenged. Such consents, approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result, enforcement may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may occur and the value of the SUN Collateral may be significantly decreased. Most of our assets will not secure the Senior Notes and it is possible that the value of the SUN Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness secured by the SUN Collateral. With respect to any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to secure the Senior Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof, such shares may also have limited value in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, which may leave little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of the SUN Collateral may decline over time. If the proceeds of the SUN Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Senior Notes, the holders of the Senior Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the SUN Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the SUN Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ remaining assets. The Senior Notes Indenture will also permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of the Senior Notes on the SUN Collateral. To the extent that holders of other indebtedness or third parties enjoy liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Senior Notes Indenture or the Security Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the SUN Collateral which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Senior Notes. Moreover, if we issue additional Senior Notes under the Senior Notes Indenture, holders of such Senior Notes would benefit from the same collateral as the holders of the Senior Notes being offered hereby, thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on the SUN Collateral.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

The ability of the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable, to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by local law.","The security interests that will secure the obligations of each Issuer under the Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under the Note Guarantees thereof will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but to the respective Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, and thus the holders of the Notes will not have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Security Documents or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the Security Documents except through the relevant Trustee or Security Agent, as 77 ----- applicable, including as may be provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting a Note, you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against us in the event of a default. See “Description of Certain Financing _Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_ In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests in the Collateral (excluding the Escrow Charges) is subject to mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over such Collateral are taken. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for the appropriation of certain pledged assets, but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Notes that are not identified as registered holders in a security document will be validly secured. In certain jurisdictions, including Germany, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests and the enforceability of such security interests, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the relevant Security Agent (“Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of each Issuer and the Guarantors owed to holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indentures (“Principal Obligations”). All or part of the pledges and other security interests in such jurisdictions will be granted to the Security Agent as security interests for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations. Under the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Parallel Debt will be at all times in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the security interests granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the relevant Security Agent. Therefore, the holders of the Notes will bear the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of the relevant Security Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt construct has not been tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions and to the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created under the Parallel Debt construct are not validly granted, are unenforceable or are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of such security interests in the Collateral.

Any failure to perfect any security interest in the Collateral may result in the invalidity of the relevant security interest or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Collateral.

The EUR SSN Issuer and the SUN Issuer are organized under the laws of Germany; the USD SSN Issuer is organized under the laws of Delaware; and the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Canada, Germany, the Netherlands and the United States. With respect to the EUR SSN Issuer, the SUN Issuer and any Guarantor organized under the laws of a member state of the European Union, there is a rebuttable presumption that the “centre of main interest” as defined in the Council of the European Union Regulation No. 2015/848 on Insolvency Proceedings is the jurisdiction where the registered office is situated.

The insolvency laws of foreign jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar. In the event that any one or more of the Issuers, the Guarantors or any other of the Issuers’ subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes against the Issuers, the enforceability of a Note Guarantee against a Guarantor and the enforceability of the Security Interests. In certain circumstances the court may also void the Security Interest or the Note Guarantee if the company is close to or near insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes. In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed insolvency administrator may challenge the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests, and intercompany obligations generally, as preferences, transaction at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to: - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Note Guarantee or the Security Interests provided by such security provider; - direct that the Issuers and the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Note Guarantee or any Security Interest to the relevant Guarantor or security provider or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s or security provider’s creditors; and - take other action that is detrimental to you. If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Note Guarantee or Security Interest is found to be a preference, transaction at an undervalue, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the liability of each Guarantor or security provider under its Note Guarantee or the Security Interests will be limited to the amount that will result in such guarantee or Security Interests not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or 79 ----- improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. The amount recoverable from the Guarantors and security providers under the Security Documents will also be limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each. There is also the possibility that the entire Note Guarantee or Security Interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. See also “—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other _limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral.”_ In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts would, for example, need to find that, at the time the Note Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests created, the Guarantor or security provider: - issued such Note Guarantee or created such Security Interest with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or created such security after its insolvency; - issued such Note Guarantee or created such Security Interest in a situation where a prudent business person as a shareholder of such Guarantor or security provider would have contributed equity to such Guarantor or security provider or where the relevant beneficiary of the Note Guarantee or Security Interest knew or should have known that the Guarantor or security provider was insolvent or a filing for insolvency had been made; or - received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Note Guarantee or Security Interest on the basis that the Note Guarantee or Security Interest were incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly the Guarantor’s or security provider’s benefit, or on some other basis and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Note Guarantee or the creation of the Security Interest, or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons; (ii) was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for which the Guarantor’s or security provider’s assets were unreasonably small; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as and when they would become due. Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor or security provider generally may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Note Guarantee or created any Security Interest if: - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets; - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; - the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute; or - its liabilities exceed the liquidation value of its assets, unless it has a positive going concern prognosis. Although we believe that both the Issuers and the Group are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the Transactions, there can be no assurance as to which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor or security provider was “insolvent” as of the date the Note Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests were created or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on the date its Note Guarantee was issued or the Security Interests were created, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

Enforcement of the obligations under a Note Guarantee against, and/or any Collateral provided by, as applicable, any such Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available to the Issuers or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be. These laws and defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or similar laws as well as 80 ----- regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally, particularly by limiting the amounts recoverable under the Note Guarantees and Collateral, as applicable, and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured by a particular Guarantor or security provider under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Note Guarantee or Collateral is not in the relevant Guarantor’s or security provider’s corporate interests, or the burden of such Note Guarantee or Collateral exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor or security provider, or such Note Guarantee or Collateral would be in breach of capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws and/or would cause the directors of such subsidiary Guarantor or security provider to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. In relation to public limited liability companies (Aktiengesellschaften, “AG”) strict German capital maintenance rules as set out in the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz, “AktG”) apply. Guarantees and/or security interests provided by an AG and/or its direct or indirect subsidiaries in order to guarantee or secure liabilities of any direct or indirect parent or affiliate company (such as the Issuers) are, unless a specific exception applies, considered disbursements violating German capital maintenance law. Furthermore, the granting of guarantees and/or security interests by an AG or its direct or indirect subsidiaries which serve the purpose of supporting the financing of the acquisition of shares in such AG (financial assistance) is prohibited and, therefore, invalid. Investors should note that the Target is incorporated in Germany in the form of an AG. All of the Post-Closing Guarantors, which are expected to provide a Guarantee and certain Collateral under the Notes after the Acquisition Closing Date, are subsidiaries of the Target and would therefore be subject to the limitations set out above. Following the consummation of the Acquisition, it is expected that the legal form of the Target will be changed from an Aktiengesellschaft to a Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung. Further, the Note Guarantees and/or security interests granted by a German limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung, “GmbH”) or a partnership with a GmbH as liable partner (i.e., a GmbH & Co. KG) for the purpose of guaranteeing or securing liabilities of its direct or indirect shareholders or a subsidiary of such shareholders (excluding direct or indirect subsidiaries of such GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG) are considered to constitute a benefit for such shareholder and therefore are subject to certain capital maintenance and liquidity maintenance rules. Therefore, any Note Guarantees and/or Collateral provided by a GmbH, including by the EUR SSN Issuer, Newco and Bidco, will be subject to certain contractual limitations (so called “limitation language”) contained in the respective Indentures (or any other document under which any Note Guarantee is granted) and that are or will be contained in the Security Documents, respectively, designed to ensure compliance with applicable capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or any other general statutory laws. Certain of the Collateral is granted by the EUR SSN Issuer, Newco and Bidco and will be subject to “limitation language.” Any guarantee and/or security interest granted by a GmbH may be held invalid pursuant to Section 138 BGB and would therefore not be enforceable if, at the time of the creation or enforcement of any such guarantee and/or security interest, among others, the third party creditor and the affiliate have acted in fraudulent conveyance (kollusives Zusammenwirken) to the detriment of the GmbH or other third party creditors of the GmbH. These principles apply mutatis mutandis to a GmbH & Co. KG. As a result, the Guarantor’s or security provider’s liability under its Note Guarantee or Collateral could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending upon the law and contractual enforcement restrictions applicable to it. This could lead to a situation in which such Note Guarantee or Collateral cannot be enforced at all. It is possible that a Guarantor or security provider, or any of their creditors, or the bankruptcy trustee or other insolvency office holder in the case of a bankruptcy/insolvency of a Guarantor or security provider, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor’s Note Guarantee or the security provider’s Collateral on any of the above grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Note Guarantee or Collateral should be limited or voided. To the extent that any limitations on the relevant Note Guarantees or Collateral apply, the Notes would be to that extent effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor or security provider, including trade payables of such Guarantor or security provider.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon the Issuers’ solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if an investor owns a book entry interest, it will be permitted to act only to the extent it has received appropriate proxies to do so from DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable. The procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable such investor to vote on a timely basis. Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indentures, unless and until Definitive Registered Notes are issued in respect of all book entry interests, if investors own book entry interests, they will be restricted to acting through DTC or Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable.

Future trading prices of the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. The Initial Purchasers have advised that they intend to make a market in the Notes after completing the Offering. However, they have no obligation to do so and may discontinue market making activities at any time without notice. In addition, such market making activity will be subject to limitations imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and other applicable laws and regulations.

(together, the “Non-U.S. Obligors”) are organized or incorporated outside the United States, and their business is substantially conducted outside the United States. The directors and executive officers of the Non-U.S. Obligors are non-residents of, and substantially all of their assets are located outside of, the United States. Although the Non-U.S. Obligors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on the directors and executive officers of Non-U.S. Obligors. In addition, as a substantial portion of the assets of the Non-U.S. Obligors and their subsidiaries and those of their directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce against them judgments obtained in U.S. courts. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Non-U.S. Obligors may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. Additionally, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of foreign jurisdictions would enforce (i) judgments of United States courts obtained against the Non-U.S. Obligors and the directors and executive officers who are not residents of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the United States federal and state securities laws or (ii) in original actions brought in such foreign jurisdictions against us or such persons predicated upon the United States federal and state securities laws.

In such a situation, the Issuers may not have enough funds to pay for all of the Notes that are tendered under any such offer. If a significant principal amount of Notes is tendered, the Issuers will likely have to obtain financing to pay for the tendered Notes. However, the Issuers may not be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms, if at all. A change of control may also result in a mandatory prepayment under the Senior Facilities Agreement and agreements governing any future indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of such indebtedness. Any failure by the Issuers to offer to purchase the Notes upon a change of control would constitute a default under the Indentures, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Senior Facilities Agreement. 83 ----- The change of control provision contained in the Indentures may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including reorganizations, restructurings, mergers, recapitalizations or other similar transactions involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a change of control as defined in the Indentures. In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control will be deemed not to be a change of control, provided that upon consummation thereof, a certain consolidated net leverage ratio of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries is met.

Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” it has no clearly established meaning under relevant law, varies according to the facts and circumstances of the subject transaction and is subject to judicial interpretation. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty in ascertaining whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of a person, and therefore it may be unclear whether a change of control has occurred and whether the relevant Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

If such modifications result in a deemed exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it would generally be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes in which beneficial owners of the Notes would be required to recognize any gain or loss. Furthermore, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the New Notes deemed issued in such a deemed exchange could be treated as issued with original issue discount. In such event, U.S. Holders (as defined under “Certain Tax Consequences—Certain U.S. _Federal Income Tax Considerations”) would be required to include the original issue discount in their income as it_ accrues, in advance of the receipt of cash corresponding to such income. In addition, the determination of whether the New Notes are treated as “contingent payment debt instruments” as a result of the possibility of additional payments, as further described under “Certain Tax Consequences—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax _Considerations—Additional Payments,” would be made at the time of the modification.

We have extracted (i) the combined historical financial information of the Elevator Technology Business for the 2016/2017, 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 Financial Years from the Audited Combined Financial Statements and (ii) the consolidated historical financial information of the Elevator Technology Business for the six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2020 from the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements, in each case, included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. As the Elevator Technology Business did not exist as a separate group and since all companies and operating activities within the Elevator Technology Business were under the common control of thyssenkrupp AG, in each case, prior to the Reorganization, the financial information presented as of and for the financial years ended September 30, 2017, 2018 and 2019 has been prepared on a combined basis. Effective with the Reorganization, the Elevator Technology Business came into existence as a separate group and therefore, the financial information presented for the Target and its consolidated subsidiaries as of and for the six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2020 was prepared on a consolidated basis. There are important differences between the Elevator Technology Business as presented in the Audited Combined Financials as of and for the 2016/2017, 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 Financial Years and the business carried out by the Target and its subsidiaries as presented in the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2020. See “Presentation of Financial Information—Basis of Preparation” and our Financial Statements included elsewhere herein. The independent auditor’s report on the Audited Combined Financial Statements is qualified due to issues regarding local book keeping and financial reporting processes, which led to qualified, adverse or disclaimer of opinions on the financial information of certain entities of the Elevator Technology Business’s Operating Unit Spanish Latin America in several instances as of September 30, 2018 and 2017 and for the financial years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The auditor’s qualification does not pertain to the combined statement of financial position as of September 30, 2019 included in the Audited Combined Financial Statements. In the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements, the issues relating to the Elevator Technology Business’s Operating Unit Spanish Latin America described above still remained for the six-month period ended March 31, 2019.

291_2,Offering 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.1,Overview,17.1.1,,"We are one of the world’s leading providers of elevator and escalator technology, with top market positions in the Americas, Europe and Africa and a strong platform to capture growth opportunities in the Asia Pacific region. We design, manufacture, install, service and modernize state-of-the-art passenger and freight elevators, escalators, moving walkways, passenger boarding bridges and chair and platform lifts, covering the entire product life cycle from new installation to service and modernization. Building on our German engineering heritage, we are an innovation leader in the digital age, leveraging Internet of Things technologies to collect data and make recommendations for repairs in real time to better serve rapidly urbanizing societies with a focus on product safety and efficiency. Operating from approximately 1,000 locations worldwide and serving customers in more than 100 countries, our business is characterized by a global sales and service network to ensure optimum proximity to clients. High-profile infrastructure projects such as One World Trade Center in New York, the tallest building in the Americas, the Beijing International Airport T3 Terminal and the Federation Tower in Russia have all featured our elevator and escalator products, illustrating our strengths and global reach. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2020, our sales and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA were €8,048 million and €1,323 million, respectively. Our operations comprise three business lines: - _New Installation:_ Our New Installation business covers the design, manufacture and installation of elevators, escalators and moving walks for all major markets and industries, including for both commercial and residential projects, and includes low-rise, mid-rise and high-rise solutions offered at different customization levels. Our New Installation business contributed 45% of sales in the twelve months ended March 31, 2020. - _Service:_ Our Service business offers a broad range of maintenance services both for our own and thirdparty equipment, with a view to ensuring the continued safety, performance and efficiency of elevators, escalators and moving walkways throughout their usable lives. Depending on the scope agreed in our service contracts, our services range from basic oil and grease maintenance to bespoke full-service packages that include the sale and installation of replacement parts. As of March 31, 2020, we had approximately 1.4 million units under maintenance. Our Service business contributed 43% of sales in the twelve months ended March 31, 2020. - _Modernization:_ Our Modernization business offers comprehensive solutions ranging from partial modernization to complete replacement of existing elevator and escalator systems and other solutions, both for our own and for third-party systems. Our Modernization business contributed 12% of sales in the twelve months ended March 31, 2020. Our life-cycle business model is built on our New Installation business, which serves as the entry to our Service business. On average, we convert 70% to 80% of new elevator and escalator installations into ongoing Service contracts. This provides a source of stable and recurring sales as we also succeeded in retaining more than 90% 94 ----- of our Service customers in each of our last three financial years. In addition, we win Service and Modernization contracts from third parties where another manufacturer undertook the New Installation. The Service and Modernization businesses, which together accounted for 54% of sales and around 70% of gross profit in the 2018/2019 Financial Year, are a source of stable, recurring sales and high profit margins for the Group, which provides visibility on future earnings. Driven by our high conversion rate and high retention rates, we have been able to maintain longstanding customer relationships. Given our global reach and high level of diversification, our top ten customers in aggregate typically account for less than 3% of our annual revenue. The following graphic illustrates the elevator life-cycle: **>90%** Retention rate 3[rd] party wins 10-20 years elevator lifetime prior to significant Modernization 3[rd] party wins New Manufacturing Selling Installation InstallationInstallation & Supply Chain **70 – 80%** Conversion rate We have two core divisions and four operating segments, which are part of our reporting segments in accordance with IFRS 8: Americas, Europe/Africa, Asia/Pacific and Access Solutions (together, our “Operating Segments”) through which we conduct our customer-facing business activities. Our first core division is the new installation, service and modernization of elevators, escalators and moving walks (the “Elevator and Escalator division”). Our second core division is the new installation, service and modernization of access solutions for airports and homes (the “Access Solutions division”). The Elevator and Escalator division is divided into three Operating Segments based on geography, which enables each to tailor its products to the specific customer needs and legal and regulatory requirements in its local markets: - _Americas:_ Our Americas segment covers our Elevator and Escalator division’s activities in the Americas and is sub-divided into two further regional units, including North America, covering the United States and Canada, and Latin America, covering Brazil as the main Latin American sales area and Spanish Latin America. Our Americas segment contributed €3,306 million, or 41%, of the Operating Segments’ total sales and €489 million, or 51%, of the Operating Segments’ Adjusted EBIT in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. - _Europe/Africa:_ Our Europe/Africa segment covers our Elevator and Escalator division’s activities in Europe and Africa and operates within a widely diverse set of geographical areas through five operational units: “DACH,” comprising Germany, Austria and Switzerland, “RET,” comprising Russia, Eastern Europe and Turkey, “FRANCE,” comprising France and Monaco, “BBNI,” comprising the Benelux countries, Britain, the Nordics and Italy and “IBA,” comprising Spain, Portugal, Angola and Morocco and, through distributors, certain African countries. Our Europe/Africa segment contributed €2,149 million, or 26%, of the Operating Segments’ total sales and €227 million, or 24%, of the Operating Segments’ Adjusted EBIT in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. - _Asia/Pacific:_ Our Asia/Pacific segment covers our Elevator and Escalator division’s activities in the Asia/ Pacific region and is organized in six operational units: China, South Korea, India, Australia/New Zealand, Southeast Asia and the Middle East.

Our New Installation business, in particular, is influenced by changes in the global economic conditions, whereas our Service and Modernization businesses are more resilient and have demonstrated strong and continuous revenue growth during periods of economic distress. Cyclicality in economic conditions and activity levels in the construction industry may result in significant fluctuations in our sales and profitability from period to period and over the business cycle, although there tends to be a time lag between changes in activity levels in the construction industry and the resulting impact on our results of operations, since elevators and escalators are often among the last items to be installed in new buildings. A robust economic environment, particularly one marked by low interest rates and borrowing costs, typically results in strong growth in construction and infrastructure projects, including growth in the construction of new residential and commercial buildings, which in turn drives demand in our New Installation business and typically 96 ----- has a positive impact on our order intake and sales. Higher activity levels in the construction industry also tend to lead to increases in the prices that we and our competitors are able to charge customers. Conversely, weaker economic conditions in our markets tend to lead to lower levels of construction activity and lower demand in our New Installation business, and therefore generally have a negative impact on our order intake and sales. Due to economic impact of COVID-19, the global economy is likely entering a period of decline, which will probably reduce construction activity around the world. In the periods presented in this offering memorandum, strong construction activity in the Americas during the 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 Financial Years was a key driver of increases in order intake in the Americas segment, whereas slowing construction activity in the Americas during the 2018/2019 Financial Year resulted in relatively slower order intake. Overall, our sales declined between 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 but increased between 2017/2018 and 2018/2019, primarily due to the adverse impact of foreign exchange fluctuations. Over the longer term, we believe that construction activity is more influenced by demographic and population trends, such as the growth in urbanization, than by short-term economic factors. We believe that urbanization in particular has been and will continue to be a fundamental long-term driver of demand for multi-story buildings and large public infrastructure projects, and therefore of elevator and escalator products, notwithstanding shorterterm variations in demand arising from changes to activity levels in the construction industry and economic developments. See “Industry.” Our Service and Modernization businesses are impacted by conditions in the construction industry to a lesser extent than the New Installation business. Services and Modernizations customers tend to enter into multi-year service contracts and, given that customers in most countries are legally obliged to comply with elevator service and safety requirements under applicable building codes, our Service business in particular tends to be relatively stable and less susceptible to fluctuations in construction activity than our New Installation business. However, construction activity has an indirect effect on our Service and Modernization businesses as the New Installation business is an important source of new customers for both.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

The New Installation business’s larger importance lies in its significant contribution to growth in new Services and Modernizations contracts, making it the starting point for our revenue life cycle. Our ability to grow our New Installation business is therefore crucial to the growth of all three of our business lines. See “—Conversion of New _Installations units into Services and Modernizations contracts and ability to retain existing, and win new, Services and Modernizations customers.”_ We believe that our ability to consistently manufacture products that are competitive on price, safety, quality and technology while maintaining an efficient supply chain in order to protect our margins are critical elements of the growth of our New Installation business. To this end, we are currently in the process of streamlining our product portfolio and standardizing certain components, as well as implementing a value-selling approach based on offering customers a flexible pricing model in which pricing is determined by the degree of product customization. See “—Operational improvement measures.” To a lesser extent, growth in the New Installation business is also driven by our ability to win high profile mandates, such as prestigious and large-scale high rise and infrastructure projects, which play a vital role in marketing our lower profile, but higher volume business.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

The Service and the Modernization businesses together accounted for 51%, 52%, 54% and 57% of our total sales in the 2016/2017, 2017/2018, 2018/2019 Financial Years (on a combined basis) and six months ended March 31, 2020 (on a consolidated basis), respectively. Our Service business is a source of stable, recurring sales and high profit margins for the Group. Service revenues can be categorized into either maintenance or repair sales (including direct spare parts sales), and vary by segment, typically comprising over half of our sales in Europe/Africa and the Americas but much less in Asia/Pacific, which is dominated by the New Installation business and Access Solutions. Profit margins tend to be higher in the Service business than in the New Installation business, mainly due to the recurring sales model and high customer retention rates. Many Service business’s customers eventually become customers of the Modernization business, which further extends the customer relationship and positions us well to provide Services to the modernized units. 97 ----- The key performance indicators for our Service business are the units under maintenance, the conversion rate and the retention rate: - _Units under maintenance: Units under maintenance is one of the Service business’s key drivers of sales growth. Over the last three financial years, units under maintenance increased at a CAGR of 1.7% to approximately 1.4 million units as of March 31, 2020. - _Conversion rate: The conversion rate is calculated as the percentage of New Installation units (excluding distributor sales, which do not directly result in access to servicing the relevant units) that have been converted into paid Service contracts. We estimate that our global conversion rate was between 70% to 80% in each of the 2016/2017, 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 Financial Years. The conversion rate thereby contributes to the growth of our units under maintenance. - _Retention rate: The retention rate is a like-for-like metric calculated as units under maintenance at the end of the year (excluding new units that were added during the year) divided by units under maintenance at the beginning of the year. The terms of our service agreements vary by jurisdiction and customer, but most last from one to five years, with service contracts following an installation often providing for an introductory period (for example, one to two years) during which the customer is not obligated to pay for services. We maintained a global average retention rate of above 90% on our service contracts over the last three financial years. We believe the key factors driving our conversion and retention rates are the breadth and global reach of our service network, with approximately 1,000 service branches in our key markets worldwide, the quality of our Services, our competitive pricing, and our innovative, digitally enhanced maintenance solutions, including products like MAX and IT solutions such as our operating business steering tool VIEW. In addition, we provide maintenance and modernization services on elevators and escalators installed by third parties through our ITS unit. Our ITS unit provides specialized training to our service personnel and focuses on the efficient refurbishment of spare parts. We believe that our ITS unit is more developed and advanced than that of our competitors and has enhanced our ability to win Services and Modernizations work from customers of our competitors.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655
291_2,Offering 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.4.4,Personnel costs,"Our results of operations are significantly affected by personnel expenses, which, together with the costs of materials, represent a significant majority of our operating costs. Personnel costs include wages and salaries, social security, post-employment and other employee benefit costs. Personnel costs related to production workers are included in cost of goods sold, whereas personnel costs for non-production workers are included in selling expenses (for example, for sales force), general and administrative expenses (for example, for human resources or other administrative functions), and research and development costs (for example, for our research engineers). Our ability to effectively manage our personnel costs has a significant impact on our gross margin and overall profitability. In the periods under review in this offering memorandum, our personnel expenses remained relatively stable at €3,135 million and €3,078 million in the 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 Financial Years, respectively, and increased by 5.9% to €3,261 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. The increase in the 2018/2019 Financial Year was primarily the result of increases in personnel expenses in the Americas and Asia/Pacific segments, reflecting headcount growth primarily in the Service business as the business grew, as well as higher salaries and wages as a result of tariff or other salary increases and impacts from translational exchange rate effects, partly offset by headcount reductions in the Europe/Africa segment. Overall, our workforce remained broadly stable over the period, with headcount numbers of 52.7 thousand in the 2016/2017 Financial Year, 53.0 thousand in the 2017/2018 Financial Year and 53.1 thousand in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. We seek to manage personnel expenses mainly through adjusting our staffing levels to match our needs when necessary, which can result in headcount growth in growing markets and reductions in slowing markets, or as a result of efficiency measures adopted to offset the impact of personnel cost inflation. Recent examples include our initiative to consolidate our US administrative functions in a shared service center at our US headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, which is expected to result in headcount reductions among back office and other personnel, as well as our ongoing efforts to reduce complexity and optimize production processes at our manufacturing facilities in the Americas and Europe. Over the 2016/2017, 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 Financial Years, we were able to offset labor cost inflation by increasing labor efficiency, resulting in a global increase of sales per FTE. Our ability to implement measures to control our personnel expenses is subject to constraints. In some jurisdictions, such as the Americas and China, local labor laws and other regulations provide us with a relatively 98 ----- high degree of flexibility in adjusting our employee headcount based on needs, and thereby the attendant personnel costs. In other jurisdictions, including Germany, our ability to optimize staffing levels and manage personnel expenses is limited by restrictive labor laws and collective agreements, such as collective bargaining agreements and works council agreements that are in place with trade unions as well as works councils and other representative bodies.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655
291_2,Offering 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.4.5,External procurement spend,"Our results of operations are significantly affected by our external procurement spend, which, together with personnel costs, comprises a significant majority of our operating costs. Material cost increases exceeding sales growth adversely impact our gross margin, and therefore our ability to control material cost is a key lever for profitability. We manage our global purchasing activities through a Group-wide procurement organization in order to leverage our purchasing ability and benefit from economies of scale and through implementing initiatives to offset price inflation. We purchase components and parts in each of our three business lines, but the largest exposure is in our New Installation business, which has the highest material costs due to its manufacturing activities. Our purchases cover a wide range of components, including electric and electronic components such as traction machines and printed circuit board assemblies, as well as mechanical components such as guiderails, shaft/cabin doors, speed governors and escalator steps, among others. These components contain raw materials such as steel, aluminum, and rare earths (which are used in magnets), and therefore prices of these components are impacted by fluctuations in the underlying raw material cost. Prices for raw materials, components and parts are susceptible to fluctuations driven by global or regional supply/demand dynamics in commodity and end markets, production capacity constraints of suppliers, availability of certain materials, transportation costs, infrastructure failures, government regulations and tariffs, geopolitical events, changes in currency exchange rates, the economic climate and other factors. For example, between the 2017/2018 Financial Year and the 2018/2019 Financial Year, material prices increased in the Americas mainly due to U.S. tariffs, which drove up material import costs. Between the 2016/2017 Financial Year and the 2017/2018 Financial Year, material prices increased in the Asia/Pacific segment due to adverse market price developments in China and Korea, which impacted our material costs as a result of the relatively high proportion of New Installation business in Asia/Pacific. Our operations in China have a high exposure to material price risk. However, during the 2017/2018 Financial Year when raw materials prices in China increased significantly compared to the previous year, it only had a limited impact on our Group overall, as the reduction in Adjusted EBIT in China during that year due to the raw material price increase was less than 5% of our Group’s total Adjusted EBIT in the same year. In order to reduce this risk, we have, among other things, increased our sales prices in China and are in regular supplier re-negotiations to reflect the material price movements. In order to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of components, we try to source our goods on a Group-wide level to leverage purchasing ability and economies of scale. We also aim to have at least two suppliers for each component in different geographic regions and regularly review changes in material prices based on published information. Nevertheless, market prices of parts and components are subject to increases as a result of the fluctuation dynamics described above. Such price increases, along with increasing transportation costs, have created some pressure on our profit margins. We seek to pass on cost increases to our customers where possible; however, due to competition in the elevator and escalator industry, we have not always been able to pass such increases on to customers in full. During the period under review, we partially offset cost increases by optimizing our supply chains through commercial measures, such as holding supplier days, clustering managed spend, and engaging in e-auctions, and technical efficiency measures, such as streamlining our product platforms and standardizing components. In the 2018/2019 Financial Year, we achieved significant purchasing savings compared to the prior year through these measures. See “—Operational improvement measures.”",N/A,as_expected,2020,655
291_2,Offering 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.4.6,Operational improvement measures,"We operate in an industry where efficiency improvements and cost savings are crucial in order to maintain or improve competitiveness and profitability. Our operational improvement measures focus broadly on four areas: (i) simplification of our product portfolio and harmonizing of components in our New Installation business; (ii) optimizing manufacturing efficiency and supply chains; (iii) increasing profitability by growing our Service business and enhancing Service quality and efficiency via digital innovations, among other measures; and (iv) reducing SG&A expenses. We have incurred substantial restructuring costs in connection with our operational improvement measures, amounting to €106 million, €35 million and €56 million in the 2016/2017, 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 Financial Years (on a combined basis), respectively and €13 million in the six months ended March 31, 2020 (on a consolidated basis). Restructuring costs in 2016/2017 were primarily driven by 99 ----- restructurings in Germany and France, whereas restructuring costs in 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 related to restructurings in Europe and the Americas. Following the Acquisition, we expect to realize €240 million in potential cost savings within 15 to 18 months after July 1, 2020 through the Sponsors’ Transformation Program, assuming, among other things, that the program will be implemented beginning on July 1, 2020 and driven by key management, including the Chief Executive Officer of the Group. The Transformation Program focuses on cost savings opportunities related to (i) commercial operations, (ii) service operations, (iii) procurement costs, (iv) G&A costs and (v) other operational costs. We expect to incur one-off costs amounting to between €240 and €294 million in connection with these initiatives, mainly as a result of (i) voluntary redundancy, early retirement and other severance costs, (ii) staff training costs, (iii) investments in IT to digitize, automate and streamline processes, (iv) investments in the existing shared service centers in Europe, Brazil and the U.S., as well as potentially operating new, regional centers in Eastern Europe and Asia and (v) consulting, financial and legal advisory fees in connection with implementing these initiatives. _New Installations standardization_ Historically, in part due to our strategy of growing through acquisitions, we provided customers with a large share of customized product solutions. This resulted in a highly diverse but overlapping product portfolio and limited price competitiveness due to the high costs of designing and producing such a wide range of individualized products. In order to drive cost efficiency by eliminating unnecessary duplication across the portfolio, the number of product platforms in the Group has been reduced by more than half in the last decade as part of a process of implementing a simplified portfolio structure, with further improvements planned going forward. The revised structure is divided into building type (i.e. low-, mid- or high-rise) and degree of customization and focuses on the most competitive platforms, which can be scaled across segments within each market. Where possible, we have also standardized and harmonized components across products. Historically, different products tended to require their own unique components, leading to higher costs than necessary. We have already streamlined our product designs to permit specific modular components, such as traction machines, controllers/ inverters and doors, to be shared across multiple product platforms and have targeted a number of additional widely used components for future harmonization. This has resulted in less complexity and easier external sourcing of components, among other benefits. These efforts, which are ongoing, have allowed and will continue to allow us to leverage economies of scale and allocate our resources more efficiently across the entire business. _Manufacturing optimization_ We are engaged in an ongoing effort to optimize our manufacturing operations and supply chains. These measures have included closing and consolidating manufacturing sites to improve our utilization rates, restructuring factories to increase our focus on the most promising products and platforms, increasing outsourcing of standardized components, and developing state-of-the-art factories that are highly automated and equipped with improved technology, advancing from a classic factory to a fulfillment and engineering center. Specifically, we have established lean manufacturing operations in Asia/Pacific, with a newly established plant in India and advances in automation at our plants in China and Korea. In the Americas, we have in recent years consolidated all manufacturing facilities in North America at our Middleton facility, which we believe will further enhance efficiency and reduce costs. In Europe, we have restructured our Móstoles plant in Spain and are currently restructuring our operations in Germany to reduce costs and simplify production. In Europe/Africa, we have also shifted our factories away from a regional focus (in which a particular factory only serves specific countries) to a model where all factories can deliver to the entire Europe/Africa region, with each factory having a dedicated product focus. In the long term, we aim to move away from a classic factory model, where the focus is on major production and shipping of complete elevator systems and requires high personnel expenses, towards a model where we produce only key, mission critical components and outsource commoditized parts, resulting in lower fixed costs and higher productivity. _Service and digitalization growth_ We aim to increase our profitability by growing our Service business, which is a source of stable, recurring sales and high margins, through multiple initiatives. We intend to increase our conversion rate, particularly in regions like China where conversion levels are currently lower than our global average, our global retention rate, and our 100 ----- rate of winning customers away from competitors by continuing to enhance the efficiency of our spare parts organization and increasing our service training, as well as by leveraging the superior quality and improving field performance of our Services and our capability to refurbish multi-brand spare parts. We believe that our innovative use of digital technology, including the recently developed MAX system, improved and faster supply chains for spare parts, as well as improved back office and IT functions such as our proprietary IT system VIEW, will enable us to improve customer satisfaction by increasing service quality and efficiency, and thereby increase customer retention rates and attract new customers while also leveraging efficiency gains. We target substantial sales growth and efficiency gains in our Service and Modernization businesses in all regions between the 2019/2020 and 2021/2022 financial years. _SG&A expense optimization_ We are committed to reducing SG&A and other expenses by centralizing administrative functions, harmonizing our IT systems and adopting a range of organizational efficiency measures as part of our “SG&A Excellence” program. Specifically, we are engaged in an ongoing effort to combine a wide array of administrative processes that historically have been performed locally, such as billing, payroll and purchasing, into shared service centers. This process is well advanced in the Americas, where for example in the United States these functions will be consolidated into one shared service center at the U.S. headquarters in Atlanta, and we intend to roll it out in other regions. We have in addition reduced the number of operating units within the Europe/Africa and the Americas segments. We are also in the process of harmonizing our IT processes by rolling out VIEW globally, continuing to transition to cloud-based services, and adopting global templates and standards, and driving efficiency throughout the global organization by “delayering,” or flattening, management levels and adopting other efficiency enhancements. These measures have resulted in more than €80 million in total SG&A savings over the last three financial years. These savings, together with lower negative non-recurring items and positive exchange rate effects, contributed to the decline in SG&A costs from €1,419 million in the 2016/2017 Financial Year to €1,301 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year, despite general salary increases. SG&A costs increased to €1,349 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year due to negative effects from exchange rates as well as sales volume and general salary increases which more than offset operational improvement measures across the Group. _Procurement Optimization_ In addition, we aim to reduce our procurement costs by optimizing our supply chains through commercial measures, such as, for example, supplier days, clustering managed spend, and engaging in e-auctions. For example, between the 2011/2012 Financial Year and the 2018/2019 Financial Year, our purchasing savings increased by 300%, outpacing our procurement spend which increased by 50%. _Transformation Program_ As part of our commercial operations initiatives under the Transformation Program, we aim to improve our organizational efficiency by restructuring and centralizing our sales supports team, including by shifting employees to low cost countries. In addition, we seek to increase our sales force productivity through various measures, including improving our administrative processes and completing faster technical sales. This is facilitated by our offering of fewer customization options resulting from the optimization of our product and service portfolios. We also intend to increase our focus on sales efforts based on product margin potentials and the conversion of New Installation units into Service contracts and later into Modernization sales. We expect to realize cost savings in an aggregate amount of €7 million related to our commercial operations initiatives. As part of our service operations initiatives under the Transformation Program, we aim to improve our organizational efficiency by rationalizing the number of our application engineers, reducing the number of platforms in our offering, standardizing our service offering and reducing the number of our service centers, particularly in the U.S. We intend to implement other measures under these initiatives as well, including improving process, technology and performance management in order to increase the productivity of our service technicians. We expect to realize cost savings in an aggregate amount of €15 million related to our service operations initiatives. As part of our procurement initiatives under the Transformation Program, we intend to implement multiple measures to reduce costs relating to our procurement activities. For the 2018/2019 Financial Year, we believe that our estimated addressable cost base for procurement activities comprised €2.1 billion of direct costs and €0.5 billion of indirect costs. To reduce these costs, we intend to establish group-wide supply agreements with global suppliers for key categories of direct materials, such as motors, cables and doors, including through leveraging change-of-control provisions under our existing supplier agreements with local or regional suppliers. We also expect to increase our focus on supplier driven innovation in connection with, among other things, 101 ----- tendering processes. To pursue improvements in specification management, we seek to standardize purchases for complex parts and establish business unit sourcing boards, which will act as advisory panels in key end markets to promote best practices and streamline procurement processes. Furthermore, we continue to shift our relationships with local suppliers to regional suppliers in order to both increase the number of sites served by our suppliers and decrease the number of our total suppliers, resulting in increased efficiencies. We also continue to streamline the amount and variety of individually supplied components in order to purchase bundles of different products and higher volumes of specific products, resulting in improved purchasing ability. Moreover, where appropriate, we target shifting to agreements with suppliers in low cost countries or otherwise shifting purchases from our suppliers of local products to products sourced from low cost countries. In addition, we are working to utilize both centralized regional lead-buyers to streamline demand-management processes and defined sourcing hubs to allow for best value and benchmark sourcing through increased spend, price and margin transparency. Furthermore, we expect to realize cost savings from our commercial operations initiatives that result in the rationalization of our product offering and standardization of our SKUs. We expect to realize cost savings in an aggregate amount of €132 million in connection with our procurement initiatives. As part of our G&A cost savings initiatives under the Transformation Program, we aim to improve our organizational efficiency and generate attrition savings through a leaner operating model, the shifting of employees to low cost countries and increased automation, including within our shared service centers. We expect to realize cost savings in an aggregate amount of €36 million related to our G&A cost savings initiatives. As part of our other operational initiatives under the Transformation Program, we aim to reduce direct and indirect personnel expenses and scrappage costs by decreasing the portion of poor quality production. We target replicating the cost of poor quality levels that we have achieved at our Korean plant (where such costs are estimated to be 0.6% of internal sales) at our other plants, particularly our Middleton plant. We also intend to outsource parts and components and streamline production overhead and assembly processes to reduce costs. We expect to realize cost savings in an aggregate amount of €50 million related to our other operational initiatives.

291_2,Offering 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.4.7,Corporate cost allocations,"Our combined statements of profit or loss for the last three financial years include corporate cost allocations from thyssenkrupp AG, which were retrospectively allocated to us in accordance with carve-out accounting principles and represent a proportionate amount of corporate costs and non-operational effects that were historically recorded at the parent company level without being recharged to the Elevator Technology Business. Our corporate costs allocations (in regards to our EBIT) amounted to €98 million, €71 million and €66 million in the 2016/2017 Financial Year, 2017/2018 Financial Year and 2018/2019 Financial Year, respectively. Corporate cost allocations within EBIT in the 2018/2019 Financial Year included corporate costs of €73 million and a partially offsetting reversal of a provision with regard to unclaimed properties in the US in the amount of €7 million, which qualified as a special item for Adjusted EBIT calculation. We do not consider these costs to be representative of our additional standalone corporate costs going forward. The relevant functions will be provided in the future by the Group itself. We estimate that additional standalone costs will amount to approximately €30 million per annum going forward, resulting in generally lower general and administrative costs than the amounts allocated to us in the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. We are exposed to translation and transactional foreign exchange risks. Due to the broad scope of our international operations, a substantial portion of our assets, liabilities, sales and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the euro. Our predominant exposures are the U.S. dollar and the Chinese renminbi. Further main foreign exchange exposures relate to the Brazilian real, the Canadian dollar and the South Korean won. Changes in the exchange rates between these currencies can affect our operations and financial position as a result of translational exchange rate effects. These effects arise because the financial results of thyssenkrupp Elevator’s subsidiaries are measured in the currency of the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates (our functional currency). The results of operations and assets and liabilities of a number of thyssenkrupp Elevator’s global subsidiaries are, therefore, measured in currencies other than the euro and are then translated into euro for presentation of our financial results, assets and liabilities in our financial statements. Consequently, fluctuations in the applicable foreign currency exchange rates may increase or decrease the euro value of our non-euro assets, liabilities, sales, costs and order intake, even if their value has not changed in the local functional currency. 102 ----- We are also exposed to transactional risk to the extent our subsidiaries and we execute transactions in a currency other than their functional currency, which arises mainly when we import components from one jurisdiction, incurring a cost in that jurisdiction’s currency, and invoice for our products and installation in the local currency. Our transactional risk exposure is less significant than our translation risk exposure, because we produce and install our products predominantly in our key markets, which generally has the effect of matching the currencies of our costs with those of our sales. Nonetheless, adverse exchange rate movements can impact the profitability of our New Installation business and, to a lesser degree, the Modernization business, to the extent key imported components become more expensive in our local sales areas. The exchange rates between the functional currencies of our global subsidiaries and the euro have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to do so in the future. Our sales, for example, decreased by 1.2% between the 2016/2017 Financial Year and the 2017/2018 Financial Year on an absolute basis, largely driven by negative foreign exchange rate movements in the U.S. dollar, the Chinese renminbi, the Brazilian real and the South Korean won, whereas in constant currency terms sales increased over the period. Sales increased by 5.0% between the 2017/2018 Financial Year and the 2018/2019 Financial Year on an absolute basis but increased less on a constant currency basis. Through their impact on sales and costs, foreign exchange movements also impact our reported profitability.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655
291_2,Offering 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.4.8,Regulatory requirements,"In all jurisdictions where we operate, our products and services are subject to laws, rules, regulations and technical standards at international, supranational, national, state and municipal levels. In particular, this regulatory framework governs the design, manufacture, installation, operation and product safety of our products and services, and is mainly outlined in applicable building laws, building codes, specific safety codes for elevators and escalators and other product safety laws, as well as laws governing airport ground equipment and airport buildings. In addition, we are subject to regulatory requirements concerning product standards for energy efficiency and sustainability. These and other applicable laws are amended and revised from time to time, typically in ways that increase the technical and safety standards applicable to elevators installed after their effective date. Such amendments and revisions may require us to update our product designs and installation procedures to ensure our Products qualify for the necessary operating licenses and otherwise comply with the new requirements. The cost of compliance with these laws can be significant, impacting our operating and compliance costs and thereby our results of operations. At the same time, the laws described above are a key driver of sales in our Service and Modernization businesses, as both new and existing customers (typically the owner of the building where work is carried out or in some cases the property manager) are required to ensure their elevators and escalators are compliant with the prevailing standards. Our Service business therefore offers a broad range of Services, from basic oil and grease maintenance to bespoke full-service packages, to ensure, among other things, optimal safety and compliance with the applicable laws in each jurisdiction where it installs and services elevators, escalators, and moving walks. In addition, with the average age of buildings and of the installed base of elevators, escalators and moving walks steadily growing in many countries, property owners increasingly need to invest in modernizing their elevators, escalators and moving walks. We therefore offer comprehensive elevator and escalator modernization to enable our customers to comply with applicable legal requirements and continue to operate safely. When governments and regulators amend the laws or otherwise introduce new requirements, our New Installation business benefits by marketing our products to construction companies and developers as compliant with such new requirements.

291_2,Offering 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.5,Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Financial Statements,17.5.1,Stand-Alone Business,"The Elevator Technology Business did not exist as a separate group prior to December 31, 2019. It formed part of a larger group of companies controlled by thyssenkrupp AG and was reported as a segment within the consolidated financial statements of thyssenkrupp AG. In order to facilitate the Acquisition, all companies and operating activities that are part of the Elevator Technology Business were transferred, directly or indirectly, to the Target in a corporate reorganization that was completed on December 31, 2019. As the Elevator Technology Business did not exist as a separate group and since all companies and operating activities within the Elevator Technology Business were under the common control of thyssenkrupp AG, in each case, prior to the Reorganization, the financial information presented as of and for the financial years ended 103 ----- September 30, 2017, 2018 and 2019 has been prepared on a combined basis. Effective with the Reorganization, the Elevator Technology Business came into existence as a separate group and therefore, the financial information presented for the Target and its consolidated subsidiaries as of and for the six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2020 was prepared on a consolidated basis. There are important differences between the Elevator Technology Business as presented in the Audited Combined Financials as of and for the financial years ended September 30, 2017, 2018 and 2019 and the business carried out by the Target and its subsidiaries as presented in the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2020. See “Presentation of _Financial Information—Basis of Preparation” and our Financial Statements included elsewhere herein. The Audited Combined Financial Statements_ As IFRS does not provide guidelines for the preparation of combined financial statements, the preparation of the Audited Combined Financial Statements was subject to IAS 8 “Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting _Estimates and Errors,” particularly IAS 8.12, which required management of thyssenkrupp Elevator AG to_ consider recent pronouncements of other standard-setting bodies, other financial reporting requirements and recognized industry practices in connection with the preparation of the Audited Combined Financial Statements. Accordingly, in preparing the Audited Combined Financial Statements, thyssenkrupp Elevator applied the predecessor accounting approach in accordance with recognized industry practices and rules on business combinations under common control. In general, thyssenkrupp Elevator used the same accounting policies and measurement principles in preparing the Audited Combined Financial Statements as were used in preparing the IFRS consolidated financial statements of thyssenkrupp AG (the “extraction method”). This approach has been adjusted with respect to transactions with thyssenkrupp Group companies and to ensure compliance with IFRS. Transactions between the Elevator Technology Business and the remaining thyssenkrupp Group were recognized in accordance with IFRS and classified as related party transactions as defined in IAS 24 “Related Party _Disclosures.”_ New IFRS accounting standards were applied in the Audited Combined Financial Statements of the Elevator Technology Business in fiscal years from October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2019, as follows: - IFRS 9 (Financial instruments) was adopted in the 2018/2019 Financial Year by opting to apply the standard prospectively (i.e., from the beginning of the 2018/2019 Financial Year) and accordingly, no adjusted comparative information was disclosed. - IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) was adopted in 2018/2019 Financial Year by applying the full retrospective approach to initial application. Due to the financial statements of that fiscal year for thyssenkrupp AG only presenting one comparative period, the cumulative transition effects were included directly in retained earnings at the start of the comparative period on October 1, 2017. In contrast, for the Audited Combined Financial Statements of the Elevator Technology Business, due to the additional comparative period from October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017 presented, according to the full retrospective approach, IFRS 15 has been applied from the beginning of the 2016/2017 Financial Year for the Audited Combined Financial Statements of the Elevator Technology Business (i.e. the cumulative transition effects were included directly in invested equity attributable to the thyssenkrupp AG at the start of the comparative period on October 1, 2016). - IFRS 16 (Leases) was adopted in the 2019/2020 Financial Year by thyssenkrupp AG by opting to apply the simplified approach of using the modified retrospective method (i.e., the cumulative transition effects are included directly in equity on October 1, 2019 and the standard is applied from the beginning of the 2019/2020 Financial Year) and no adjusted comparative information was accordingly disclosed. Additional information on the scope and basis of preparation of the Audited Combined Financial Statements and the application of significant accounting policies is presented in Note 1 “Basis of preparation” and Note 2 “Summary of significant accounting policies” to the Audited Combined Financial Statements. As a result, the Audited Combined Financial Statements included in this offering memorandum may not reflect what the results of operations, financial position and cash flows would have been had the Group operated as a separate, stand-alone business without the shared resources of thyssenkrupp AG for the periods presented, and may not be indicative of our future results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The fact that the companies and operating activities comprising the Elevator Technology Business did not historically exist as a separate group limits the validity of the combined financial information. 104 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

In preparing the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements, thyssenkrupp Elevator applied the predecessor accounting approach in accordance with recognized industry practices and rules on business combinations under common control in line with IDW RS HFA 50 Module IFRS 3 M2 published by the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer in Deutschland e.V., IDW). In general, thyssenkrupp Elevator applied the same accounting policies and measurement principles in preparing the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements as were used in preparing the IFRS consolidated financial statements of thyssenkrupp AG (i.e., the “extraction method”).

The Financial Statements in this offering memorandum have not been adjusted to reflect the impact of any changes that might occur as a result of purchase price allocation effects to be applied as a result of the Transactions. However, Vertical Topco III will account for the Acquisition using the acquisition method in accordance with IFRS 3 “Business _Combinations” and will apply purchase price allocation effects in connection with the Transactions to their_ financial statements for accounting periods subsequent to the Acquisition Closing Date. The application of purchase accounting could result in different carrying values for existing assets and assets we may add to our balance sheet, which may include intangible assets, such as goodwill, leasehold rights and software, and different amortization and depreciation expenses. Due to these and other potential adjustments, our future financial statements could be materially different once the adjustments are made and may not be comparable to the Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. Additional information on the necessary allocation procedures is set forth in Note 1 to the Audited Combined Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. We will also incur a substantial amount of indebtedness as a result of the Transactions. As of March 31, 2020, on an unaudited pro forma basis to give effect to the Transactions, we would have had €8,254 million of outstanding total indebtedness, comprising the €4,050 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes offered hereby, the €650 million in aggregate principal amount of Private Senior Notes, the €3,550 million in aggregate principal amount of borrowings under the Senior Term Facilities and €4 million in aggregate principal amount of borrowings under local facilities. See “Capitalization.” In addition, we currently use “thyssenkrupp” as part of our product marks, corporate marks and as part of the company names, business designations and domains to operate our business which is licensed from thyssenkrupp AG. Under the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, we are required to make commercially reasonable best efforts to introduce a new brand for our business within six months after the Acquisition Closing Date. Further, the existing licensing arrangement to use the mark “thyssenkrupp” will cease at the end of eighteen months from the Acquisition Closing Date. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Relationships with _the thyssenkrupp Group in the Past—License Agreement.” The intangible asset for the right of use of the_ thyssenkrupp brand has been classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 in the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements.

On January 13, 2016, the IASB published IFRS 16 (Leases), and the European Union adopted IFRS 16 on November 9, 2017. IFRS 16 replaced IAS 17 and the related IFRIC and SIC interpretations, and resulted in almost all leases being recognized on the balance sheet, as the distinction between operating and finance leases was eliminated. Under the new standard, the lessee recognizes an asset (the right-to-use the leased asset) and a financial liability to pay lease payments. The only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases should a company elect to apply an available practical 105 ----- expedient in order to reduce the transition effort. IFRS 16 became effective for fiscal years commencing on or after January 1, 2019. The Group adopted IFRS 16 (Leases) on October 1, 2019, by opting to apply the simplified approach of using the modified retrospective method, which means that the cumulative transition effects are included directly in equity on October 1, 2019 and the standard is applied from the beginning of the 2019/2020 Financial Year. Accordingly, no adjusted comparative information was disclosed. The first-time adoption of IFRS 16 had significant impact on certain balance sheet and income statement items, as described above and also in Note 3 in the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. The transition to IFRS 16 on October 1, 2019, gave rise to changes to our assets and liabilities. As a result, figures as of and for the six months ended March 31, 2020, may not be comparable to the results presented for prior periods. As of March 31, 2020, our right-of-use assets amounted to €397 million and lease liabilities amounted to €330 million. The depreciation of right-of-use assets for the six months ended March 31, 2020, amounted to €49 million and the interest expense from lease liabilities amounted to €8 million.

See “Summary—Recent Developments—Coronavirus (COVID_19).” We believe that in the medium to long term, the outbreak of COVID-19 will not have a material adverse effect on our overall business and results of operations, due to the underlying resilience of our business and immediate implementation of contingency measures. Our New Installation business was temporarily impacted in countries with lockdown measures, as discussed above. However, all our manufacturing plants are currently operational. Our Service business has performed largely as expected, given applicable safety and regulatory requirements. In our Financial Statements, COVID-19 is considered as a trigger event for an impairment test of goodwill as of March 31, 2020. Therefore, the operational planning of the Elevator Technology Business was tested for validity against the background of the COVID-19 pandemic and, in effect, the recoverability of goodwill of the Elevator Technology Business was not classified as critical. Furthermore, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment were also tested for impairment per March 31, 2020, which did not result in any impairment losses for the Elevator Technology Business. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and the industry will ultimately depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the outbreak and the length of time it takes for demand and return and for normal economic and operating conditions to resume.

Due to these issues, PwC was unable to obtain sufficient information and evidence required to assess the existence, completeness, valuation and cut-off of the assets and liabilities as well as the income and expense of these subsidiaries and, as a result, was unable to determine whether any adjustments might have been necessary in respect of the combined financial position as of September 30, 2018 and 2017 and the combined statements of profit and loss, comprehensive income and changes in equity or net cash flows as reported in the combined statement of cash flows for the financial years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 (see Note 1 of the Audited Combined Financial Statements).

The decrease was primarily driven by lower sales due to less supply for major projects to other Operating Segments. Our sales for the Americas segment increased by €92 million, or 5.8%, from €1,597 million in the six months ended March 31, 2019 to €1,689 million in the six months ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in sales across all business lines in the United States, positive exchange rate effects from USD and additional sales from companies acquired in the second half of the previous Financial Year. The positive effects were partly offset by lower sales in South America, mainly due adverse exchange rate effects from BRL. Our sales for the Asia/Pacific segment decreased by €19 million, or 1.8%, from €1,047 million in the six months ended March 31, 2019 to €1,028 million in the six months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by lower New Installation sales in the Middle East due to less major infrastructure projects, as well as COVID-19 related sales decline in China in the second quarter. Our sales for the Access Solutions segment increased by €3 million, or 1.6%, from €188 million in the six months ended March 31, 2019 to €191 million in the six months ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by higher New Installation and Service sales in our airport solutions in the United States, partly offset by a decline in the home solutions sales, mainly due to COVID-19, with the main impact in China and to a lesser extent, in Europe. _Cost of sales_ Our cost of sales increased by €70 million, or 2.5%, from €2,767 million in the six months ended March 31, 2019 to €2,837 million in the six months ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by a higher sales volume in the Americas segment. _Research and development cost_ Our research and development cost increased by €5 million, or 16.1%, from €31 million in the six months ended March 31, 2019 to €36 million in the six months ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by higher amortization related to capitalized global R&D project costs. _Selling expenses_ Our selling expenses increased by €8 million, or 3.2%, from €250 million in the six months ended March 31, 2019 to €258 million in the six months ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by an increase of allowances for financial assets in the Europe/Africa and Asia/Pacific segments. _General and administrative expenses_ Our general and administrative expenses decreased by €35 million, or 8.3%, from €421 million in the six months ended March 31, 2019 to €386 million in the six months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by lower personnel expenses as a result of operational improvement measures mainly in the Americas segment, particularly in the United States and the Europe/Africa segment, especially in manufacturing in Spain and Italy and Corporate Elevator segments. Furthermore, lower restructuring related costs in the Americas segment (mainly in the United States) and Europe/Africa (mainly manufacturing and British Islands), as well as lower travel expenses across all segments positively impacted the cost development. 109 ----- _Other income_ Our other income decreased by €6 million, or 17.6%, from €34 million in the six months ended March 31, 2019 to €28 million in the six months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by lower miscellaneous income gains. _Other expenses_ Our other expenses increased by €12 million or 11.7% from €103 million in the six months ended March 31, 2019 to €115 million in the six months ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by higher expenses relating to the license agreement with thyssenkrupp AG in connection with the use of the “thyssenkrupp” brand, partly offset by reduced miscellaneous other expenses. _Financial income/(expense), net_ Our financial income/(expense), net decreased by €37 million from an income of €13 million in the six months ended March 31, 2019 to an expense of €(24) million in the six months ended March 31, 2020. This effect was primarily driven by financial interest paid for thyssenkrupp Group intragroup financial accounts in the current reporting period versus financial income received for thyssenkrupp Group intragroup financial accounts in the previous reporting period. _Income tax (expense)/income_ Our income tax (expense)/income decreased by €8 million, or 8.3%, from €(96) million in the six months ended March 31, 2019 to €(88) million in the six months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by lower pre-tax results. _Adjusted EBIT_ The table below sets forth our Adjusted EBIT by segments and the period on period percentage of change for the six months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019.

The increase was primarily driven by increased sales in our Americas segment. In the United States, sales increased across all business lines and were particularly strong within the Service business. This was partly offset by lower sales in our Europe/Africa segment as a result of lower sales from the manufacturing entities to other business units, as well as COVID-19 related decline, especially in the second quarter in the Asia/Pacific segment. 108 ----- Sales by Segment The table below sets forth our sales by segment and the period on period percentage of change for the six months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

The increase was primarily driven by higher profits in the Americas segment, namely in the United States where profitable Service growth and favorable exchange rate effects contributed to the positive result, the Asia/Pacific segment due to operational improvement measures, which influenced the result positively and could compensate for negative implications from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our Europe/Africa segment’s Adjusted EBIT remained largely constant with a marginal increase of €1 million from €101 million in the six months ended March 31, 2019 to €102 million in the six months ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by higher sales and more profitable margins as a result of operational improvements in the DACH region. Our Americas segment’s Adjusted EBIT increased by €15 million, or 6.6%, from €227 million in the six months ended March 31, 2019 to €242 million in the six months ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by a higher sales volume in the United States, especially within the profitable Service business and by positive exchange rate effects. Our Asia/Pacific segment’s Adjusted EBIT increased by €7 million, or 11.5%, from €61 million in the six months ended March 31, 2019 to €68 million in the six months ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by a higher share of Service profits as well as a solid development of the New Installation business in China, partially offset by negative impact from the COVID-19 pandemic in the second quarter. 110 ----- Our Access Solutions division’s Adjusted EBIT decreased by €9 million, or 29.0%, from €31 million in the six months ended March 31, 2019 to €22 million in the six months ended March 31, 2020.

The increase was primarily driven by strong growth in the Americas segment as a result of robust increases in both New Installations and Services due to higher repair sales in the United States, moderate growth in the Europe/Africa segment due to growth in Service sales in Germany and Spain and New Installations growth in the Access Solutions segment, partially offset by a decline in the Asia/ Pacific segment due to weaker market development in New Installations in South Korea.

The increase was primarily driven by moderate growth in Service sales in Germany and Spain, supported by continued strong conversion and retention rates, partially offset by negative currency effects from the Turkish lira. 111 ----- Our sales in the Americas segment increased by €323 million, or 10.8%, from €2,983 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year to €3,306 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. The increase was primarily driven by robust increases in both New Installations as well as Services due to strong growth in repair sales in the United States. Positive currency effects from the U.S. dollar also contributed to the increase. Our sales in the Asia/Pacific segment decreased by €30 million, or 1.3%, from €2,337 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year to €2,307 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. The decrease was primarily driven by weaker market development in New Installations in South Korea, partly offset by Service growth due to robust conversions of units from the New Installation business in China as a result of continued high New Installations sales volumes and positive exchange rate effects mainly relating to the Chinese renminbi. Our sales in the Access Solutions segment increased by €13 million, or 3.5%, from €372 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year to €385 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. The increase was primarily driven by New Installations growth in the Home Solutions business. _Cost of sales_ Our cost of sales increased by €274 million, or 4.9%, from €5,552 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year to €5,826 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. Such increase mirrored the percentage increase in sales for the period, with cost of sales as a percentage of sales remaining constant at 73% for both Financial Years. Personnel costs increased due to labor cost inflation in all segments and due to adverse currency effects particularly in the Americas segment, but were partly offset by increased labor efficiency and structural improvements resulting from our operational improvement measures. Material costs increased in the United States due to volume increases in both the New Installation business and the Service business and due to the impact of U.S. tariffs, for which the positive effects from purchasing volume savings programs could only partly compensate. Operational issues at the Middleton manufacturing facility also had a negative impact on cost of sales in the Americas. In the Asia/Pacific segment, lower sales volumes in South Korea and material cost-reduction measures in China contributed to lower cost of sales. _Research and development cost_ Our research and development cost increased by €4 million, or 5.9%, from €68 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year to €72 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. The increase was primarily driven by higher costs for regular product maintenance activities in the Europe/Africa segment, which is required and conducted in order to keep our product portfolio up-to-date and to ensure that our products comply with all codes and standards. _Selling expenses_ Our selling expenses increased by €35 million, or 7.4%, from €476 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year to €511 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. The increase was primarily driven by higher sales volumes and foreign exchange rate effects mainly in the Americas segment as well as general salary increases, partially offset by efficiency gains from operational improvement measures. _General and administrative expenses_ Our general and administrative expenses increased by €13 million, or 1.6%, from €825 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year to €838 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. These were primarily due to general inflationary cost increases and adverse impact from foreign exchange fluctuations, partly offset by the effect of operational improvement measures focused on reducing global SG&A costs. _Other income_ Our other income increased by €9 million, or 17.6%, from €51 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year to €60 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year due to miscellaneous income gains. _Other expenses_ Our other expenses increased by €21 million, or 11.4%, from €185 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year to €206 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. The increase was primarily driven by a provision taken in connection with a lawsuit. 112 ----- _Financial income/(expense), net_ Our financial income/(expense), net decreased by €7 million, or 30.4%, from €23 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year to €16 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. The decrease was primarily driven by a €23 million increase in financial expense over the period mainly due to higher interest expenses owed on thyssenkrupp Group intragroup financial accounts, offset by a €15 million increase in financial income due to higher interest income earned on thyssenkrupp Group intragroup financial accounts. _Income tax (expense)/income_ Our income tax (expense)/income increased by €97 million, or 76.4%, from €(127) million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year to €(224) million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. The increase was primarily driven by the absence of one-time effects from the US tax reform which had occurred in the previous year. _Adjusted EBIT_ The table below sets forth our Adjusted EBIT by segments and the period on period percentage of change for the 2018/2019 and the 2017/2018 Financial Years.

Our Americas segment’s Adjusted EBIT increased from €476 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year to €489 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year, driven by growth in the Service business supported by increased repair sales, positive impacts from efficiency gains and purchasing volume savings programs and positive exchange rate effects mainly relating to the US dollar, offsetting the negative developments in the New Installation business relating mainly to adverse material price effects resulting from US tariffs and operational inefficiencies at the Middleton manufacturing facility. Our Europe/Africa segment’s Adjusted EBIT increased from €212 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year to €227 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year, primarily driven by growth in the Service Business, especially in Germany, as well as efficiency gains and structural improvements from operational improvement measures. Our Asia/Pacific segment’s Adjusted EBIT increased from €148 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year to €178 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year, primarily driven by higher profits from the New Installation business due to improved market pricing and material cost reduction measures in China as well as growth in the Service business due to robust conversion from New Installation business units in China. These effects were partly offset by negative developments resulting from the market decline of the New Installation business in South Korea. Our Access Solutions division’s Adjusted EBIT increased from €58 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year to €62 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. The increase was primarily driven by reductions of corporate costs. 113 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

The decrease was primarily due to adverse currency effects, particularly with respect to the U.S. dollar and the Brazilian real, which negatively impacted sales in the Americas segment, as well as adverse currency effects with respect to the Chinese renminbi and the South Korean won, which negatively impacted sales in the Asia/Pacific segment. As a consequence, sales in the Americas segment declined by 4.4% between the 2016/2017 Financial Year and the 2017/2018 Financial Year, while sales in the Asia/Pacific segment increased by 1.7%. Excluding currency effects, sales increased in the Americas due to strong levels of construction activity, which drove New Installations, and increased at a higher rate in Asia/Pacific due to growth in Services. Sales in the Europe/Africa segment increased by 2.6% over the period, partially offsetting the decrease resulting from the sales decline in the Americas segment.

The increase was primarily driven by higher sales in the New Installation business as a result of major infrastructure projects delivered by the Europe/Africa segment to our Middle East region. There was marginal sales growth in the Service and Modernization 114 ----- businesses, mainly driven by operations in the DACH operating unit (comprising Germany, Austria and Switzerland), supported by strong conversion and retention rates. These increases were partly offset by negative currency effects with respect to the Turkish lira and the Russian ruble. Our sales in the Americas segment decreased by €136 million, or 4.4%, from €3,119 million in the 2016/2017 Financial Year to €2,983 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year. The decrease was primarily driven by negative currency effects in the U.S. dollar and Brazil real, which mainly impacted the New Installation business, partially mitigated by strong levels of construction activity and growth in the Service businesses as a result of management’s focus on increasing repair sales and increased growth in Modernizations contracts in the United States. Our sales in the Asia/Pacific segment increased by €39 million, or 1.7%, from €2,298 million in the 2016/2017 Financial Year to €2,337 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year. Strong conversion rates in China and South Korea resulted in significant Services growth, which was partly offset mainly by negative currency effects with respect to the Chinese renminbi and the South Korean won. Sales in the New Installation business Unit suffered mainly due to a weaker market in South Korea. Our sales in the Access Solutions segment increased by €4 million, or 1.1%, from €368 million in the 2016/2017 Financial Year to €372 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year. The increase was primarily driven by growth in New Installations as a result of major airport projects in Turkey and the United States, partially offset by declines in Services and Modernizations sales as a result of the expiry of certain Service agreements and the completion of several Modernizations projects. _Cost of sales_ Our cost of sales remained relatively constant at €5,561 million in the 2016/2017 Financial Year and €5,552 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year. Cost of sales increased slightly as a percentage of sales from 72.5% in the 2016/2017 Financial Year to 73.3% in the 2017/2018 Financial Year due to material costs increases in the Asia/Pacific segment as a result of negative price developments in China and South Korea, which mainly impacted New Installation, the largest business in that region. These increases were offset by decreases in the Americas segment as a result of favorable currency effects with respect to the U.S. dollar and Brazilian real, although material prices in the Americas were also adversely impacted by U.S. tariffs, mainly on steel imports from China, over the period. Material price increases were also partly offset by positive impacts from purchasing volume savings programs. Personnel costs were broadly stable over the period, as labor cost inflation effects were offset by increased labor efficiency measures and favorable currency effects. _Research and development cost_ Our research and development cost decreased by €19 million, or 21.8%, from €87 million in the 2016/2017 Financial Year to €68 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year. The decrease was primarily driven by the capitalization, in accordance with IAS 38, of certain research and development expenses in the 2017/2018 Financial Year (including global projects such as MULTI and other mature and professionalized global research and development projects). _Selling expenses_ Our selling expenses decreased by €76 million, or 13.8%, from €552 million in the 2016/2017 Financial Year to €476 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year. The decrease was primarily driven by a decline in allowances for financial assets, mainly due to allowances in connection with a restructuring program in the Middle East which were recorded in the 2016/17 Financial Year. Further decreases resulted from SG&A improvement measures globally, particularly in Asia/Pacific where we made progress centralizing administrative costs and carrying out other cost savings initiatives in China, and favorable exchange rates with respect to the U.S. dollar. _General and administrative expenses_ Our general and administrative expenses decreased by €42 million, or 4.8%, from €867 million in the 2016/2017 Financial Year to €825 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year. The decrease was primarily driven by reduced corporate cost allocations from thyssenkrupp AG, operational improvements and a positive impact from exchange rates mainly in relation to the U.S. dollar. 115 ----- _Other income_ Our other income increased by €10 million, or 24.4%, from €41 million in the 2016/2017 Financial Year to €51 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year, primarily due to a one-time legal settlement. _Other expenses_ Our other expenses increased by €49 million, or 36.0%, from €136 million in the 2016/2017 Financial Year to €185 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year. The increase was primarily driven by increased expenses relating to license fee payments to thyssenkrupp AG in connection with our use of the “thyssenkrupp” brand. _Financial income/(expense), net_ Our financial income/(expense), net decreased by €4 million, or 14.8%, from €27 million in the 2016/2017 Financial Year to €23 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year. The decrease was primarily driven by a €27 million decrease in finance income over the period mainly due to lower interest income earned on thyssenkrupp Group intragroup financial accounts which was offset by a €23 million decrease in finance expense as a result of lower interest expenses owed on thyssenkrupp Group intragroup financial accounts. _Income tax (expense)/income_ Our income tax (expense)/income decreased by €151 million, or 54.3%, from €(278) million in the 2016/2017 Financial Year to €(127) million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year. The decrease was primarily driven by the US tax reform, which resulted in a devaluation of deferred tax liabilities in the United States as well as a lower applicable tax rate on US profits in the 2017/18 financial year. _Adjusted EBIT_ The table below sets forth our Adjusted EBIT by segment and the period on period percentage of change for the 2017/2018 and 2016/2017 Financial Years.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

Our Adjusted EBIT in the Europe/Africa segment decreased from €223 million in the 2016/2017 Financial Year to €212 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year. The decrease was primarily driven by lower profitability in the New Installation business due to performance issues in both project execution in Turkey and France as well as in the Group’s European manufacturing operations, which was only partly offset by Service business growth and positive impacts from restructuring and efficiency measures in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and France. Our Adjusted EBIT in the Americas segment decreased from €509 million in the 2016/2017 Financial Year to €476 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year. The decrease was primarily driven by lower profitability in the New Installation business due to adverse currency effects with respect to the US dollar and Brazilian real, as well as increased costs arising from US tariffs, in particular for steel imports from China, only partly offset by positive effects from Service growth and efficiency measures. Our Adjusted EBIT in the Asia/Pacific segment decreased from €203 million in the 2016/2017 Financial Year to €148 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year. The decrease was primarily driven by decreased profitability in the New Installation business as a result of negative material cost developments in China and South Korea. These 116 ----- effects were partially offset by profit gains from efficiency measures in China in the form of centralization and other cost savings initiatives as well as Service business growth due to conversion of units from the New Installation business. Our Adjusted EBIT in the Access Solutions division increased from €55 million in the 2016/2017 Financial Year to €58 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year. The increase was primarily driven by higher sales volumes, in particular two major airport projects in Turkey and the United States, and operational improvements as a result of SG&A cost reductions.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

The availability of our Revolving Credit Facility will be subject to certain conditions.

Our ability to generate cash flow from operations depends on our future operating performance, which is in turn dependent on general economic, financial, competitive, market and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, we anticipate that we will be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future and our ability to generate future financing cash flows will be limited by the Indentures and the Senior Facilities, which may have important negative consequences for you.

The increase was primarily driven by the increased net income (before non-cash items like depreciation, amortization and deferred taxes) partially offset by an overall increase in net working capital. Our operating cash flows on a combined basis increased by €200 million, or 72.5%, from €276 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year to €476 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. The increase was primarily driven by declines in working capital, including positive cash flow effects from development of inventories, trade accounts receivable and contract assets, partially offset by net negative cash flow effects from net development of contract liabilities and provisions. The increase was also due to minor effects resulting from an increase in net income before non-cash items, mainly comprising deferred tax effects. 117 ----- Our operating cash flows on a combined basis decreased by €217 million, or 44.0%, from €493 million in the 2016/2017 Financial Year to €276 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year, despite an increase in net income before changes in working capital. The decrease was primarily driven by the significant overall increase in net working capital, including negative cash flow effects from development of trade accounts receivable, contract assets, provisions and trade payables, partially offset by positive cash flow effects from development of contract liabilities. The decrease was also due to effects resulting from increased net income before non-cash items, including depreciation, amortization and deferred taxes. _Cash flows from investing activities_ Our cash outflows on a consolidated basis from investing activities strongly increased by €3,228 million from €58 million in the six months ended March 31, 2019 to €3,286 million in the six months ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by acquisitions of shares in the Group companies from thyssenkrupp Group during the six months ended March 31, 2020 as part of the legal reorganization of the Group finalized as of December 31, 2019. Our cash outflows on a combined basis from investing activities increased by €1,267 million from €116 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year to €1,383 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. This increase was primarily driven by the one-time €1,080 million fee paid in connection with the Licensing Agreement for the use of the “thyssenkrupp” brand (see “Business—Intellectual Property”), increased expansions and major project expenditure, specifically the acquisitions of Nashville Machine Elevator and O’Keefe Elevator Company Inc. and advance payments in connection with thyssenkrupp Group internal asset transfers, including €74 million of real estate assets, in preparation for the operational carve-out of the elevator technology business. Our cash outflows on a combined basis from investing activities decreased by €29 million, or 20.0%, from €145 million in the 2016/2017 Financial Year to €116 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in cash outflow for capital expenditures mainly with respect to property, plant and equipment following the finalization of several major investments in the Asia/Pacific segment. _Cash flows from financing activities_ Our cash flows on a consolidated basis from financing activities strongly increased by €3,052 million from an outflow of €32 million in the six months ended March 31, 2019 to an inflow of €3,020 million in the six months ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by a significant increase in amounts received from thyssenkrupp Group due to the existing integration of the Group into the cash pooling of thyssenkrupp Group and due to capital increases. These increased cash inflows were mainly associated with the already mentioned legal reorganization of the Group. Our cash flows on a combined basis from financing activities increased by €1,156 million, or 583.8%, from an outflow of €198 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year to an inflow of €958 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in amounts received pursuant to thyssenkrupp Group intragroup financing arrangements. Our cash outflow on a combined basis from financing activities decreased by €151 million, or 43.3%, from outflows of €349 million in the 2016/2017 Financial Year to outflows of €198 million in the 2017/2018 Financial Year.

Credit risk management is governed by corporate guidelines. Companies and business operating activities of the Group are required to implement credit risk management in accordance with these guidelines. In order to minimize default risks (credit risks) from the use of financial instruments, we only conclude such transactions with counterparties that meet our internal minimum requirements. We currently conclude our financial instruments with thyssenkrupp AG or with financial institutions. After the Acquisition Closing Date, we expect to conclude new financial instruments with financial institutions only. We generally manage default risks by requiring suitable advance as well as progress payments. In rare cases where a credit risk analysis suggests a potentially higher default risk, letters of credit and payment guarantees from banks, insurance companies and management companies are requested. In order to minimize default risks from operating activities, our corporate guidelines provide for the assessment of default risk based on the risk profile of the business partner using suitable internal and, where available, external information, such as ratings and credit reports, in conjunction with the corresponding estimation of financial risk exposure regarding the respective business transaction from our perspective. We make a credit decision for each transaction with each business partner using the aforementioned approach. Considering the individual characteristics of our customer structures and business models, we lay down clear process rules for determining which measures are to be taken in the event of a payment default in order to mitigate the maximum default risk as far as possible. Transactions the value of which exceeds specified materiality thresholds, especially in the area of major sales contracts, also require prior approval at different management levels within the Group.

Translational risk arises when we translate the financial statements of our subsidiaries which have a functional currency other than our functional reporting currency, the euro. Transactional risk arises when our subsidiaries execute transactions in a currency other than their functional currency. In the years ended September 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, 77% of our net sales were generated by operating subsidiaries with a functional currency (generally the local currency) other than the euro. In terms of our results of operations, the US dollar, the Chinese renminbi, the Brazilian real, the Canadian dollar and the South Korean won are the most important foreign currencies, though for the purposes of sensitivity analysis under IFRS 7, the US dollar is the only relevant risk variable. Our policy is to continuously monitor such risks through our risk management system. There have been no significant risk concentrations in the past financial year, as less than 5% of net sales require derivative foreign currency hedging as of the financial year ended September 30, 2019, of which approximately 75% is linked to the euro and U.S. dollar. Of our sales for the 2018/2019 Financial Year, 55% were either in euro or U.S. dollar. Foreign currency hedging is used to fix prices on the basis of hedging rates as protection against any unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations in the future. Hedging periods are generally based on the maturities of underlying transactions. Foreign currency derivative contracts usually have maturities of twelve months or less, but can also be up to six years in exceptional cases. The U.S. dollar is the only relevant risk variable for sensitivity analyses under IFRS 7, as the vast majority of foreign currency cash flows occur in U.S. dollars. As hedging transactions are generally used to hedge underlying transactions, opposite effects in underlying and hedging transactions are almost entirely offset over the total 122 ----- period. Thus, the transactional currency risk exposure results from hedging relationships with off-balance sheet underlying transactions, i.e., hedges of firm commitments and forecasted sales. Both the proceeds from the offering of, and the liabilities incurred under, the SSN USD Notes, the SUN USD Notes and the USD TLB Facility will be denominated in U.S. dollar. We may consider entering into certain derivative agreements for hedging all or a portion of our exposure to fluctuations in the euro-value of these liabilities. We have not yet completed our analysis and procedures to determine the accounting treatment of such potential derivative agreements.

Refinancing and variable-rate financial instruments are subject to cash flow risk which expresses the uncertainty of future interest payments. We measure cash flow risk by means of cash flow sensitivity. Opportunity effects arise from non-derivatives, as these are measured at amortized costs rather than fair value, in contrast to interest derivatives. The difference, the so-called opportunity effect, affects neither our statement of financial position nor the statement of profit or loss. Opportunity effects and interest rate risks affecting the statement of financial position and earnings are determined by calculating fair value sensitivity analyses and changes. Borrowings under the Senior Facilities, the SSN EUR FRN Notes and the Private Senior Notes will be variable rate debt.

This method requires accurate estimates of the extent of progress towards completion. Depending on the methodology to determine contract progress, the significant estimates include total contract costs, remaining costs to completion, total contract sales, contract risks and other judgments. The managements of the operating companies continually review all estimates involved in such contraction contracts and adjust them as necessary. The expected variable consideration amount is estimated at the inception of a contract with a customer. The estimate is made using either the probability-weighted expected value or the most likely amount. The estimation method giving the better forecast for the respective contract is always used. The variable consideration amount estimated at contract inception is reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted as necessary. In the case of contracts with customers which have distinct performance obligations, the required allocation of the transaction price to the distinct performance obligations is carried out by reference to the relative standalone selling prices. The relative standalone selling prices used generally correspond to directly observable market 124 ----- prices at which we separately sell the performance obligations to other customers. If the standalone selling price is not directly observable, we make a best estimate of the standalone selling price.

291_2,Offering 2020.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.1,Overview of the Elevator and Escalator Market,18.1.1,New Installation,"The New Installation business encompasses the sale of new equipment and the associated manufacturing, delivery and installation at the desired site. The market for new installations of elevator and escalator projects is driven by demand from the broader construction industry. It is therefore largely project-based and often subject 126 ----- to a competitive tender process, and selection by developers or contractors will depend on a number of factors, including budget, technical specifications and service offerings post-installation. In connection with the new installation tender process, OEMs also seek to secure longer-term, recurring service contracts for installed units. OEMs term this the conversion process, and often measure their performance in part based on their conversion rate of New Installations units to Service contracts. New Installation business is therefore an important driver for growth of the Service business. OEMs also consistently work to increase the efficiency of their manufacturing supply chain. Components may be sourced from third-party suppliers or produced in-house depending on the level of complexity and customization required. Whereas in the past a large share of the components were often manufactured in-house by the OEM itself, there has been a trend in the industry to outsource a larger range of components, such as elevator doors, to third-party suppliers. This has reduced the complexity of the production process for OEMs as their factory sites increasingly shift from deep manufacturing to component configuration. Once manufactured, elevators are typically shipped in pieces and assembled on site, whereas escalators are typically assembled in the factory and shipped as a complete product. Installation may be completed by an OEM’s own employees or outsourced to sub-contractors. Additionally, producers attract business through technology and innovation that reduces product downtime and fulfills other buyer requirements. For instance, energy-saving technologies can help buyers reach sustainability goals for their projects and advanced destination controls can increase the number of passengers able to be dispatched per hour. Furthermore, recent developments in IoT technology, such as real-time diagnosis and reporting of events by the elevator itself to an OEM’s service center, present an attractive proposition to New Installations buyers with the prospect of more efficient service during the lifetime of the elevator or escalator and enhanced contract retention for OEMs.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655
291_2,Offering 2020.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.1,Overview of the Elevator and Escalator Market,18.1.2,Service,"The Service business involves the full range of steps required to properly maintain an elevator or escalator throughout its usable life and is mission-critical in nature. For business owners, regular service of elevators and escalators is essential to maintain consistent uptime and safety of users in their facilities. Furthermore, elevators and escalators are subject to broad and sometimes diverse sets of regulations and safety standards across jurisdictions which typically require maintenance on elevators and escalators by licensed service professionals in certain intervals. In addition, Service customers are often property owners who are able to pass through maintenance costs to tenants, making them somewhat less price sensitive when choosing a Service provider. Based on long-term customer relationships through service contracts, the Service business can provide recurring and reliable sales streams to Service providers at higher margins than the New Installation business. Service providers as a result are able to achieve a higher degree of visibility into resilient and recurring future earnings through the elevator or escalator lifecycle, as illustrated by the graphic below: t h y s s e n k r u p p E l e v a t o r v a l u e c h a i n ( i l l u s t r a t i v e ) Elevator lifetime: c. 10-20 years of elevator lifetime prior to significant Modernization Warranty Maintenance fee Spare parts Time Service agreements tend to fall into one of three categories based on service scope: full maintenance, partial maintenance and oil & grease. Terms of service agreements may vary by jurisdiction and customer, but often last one to five years. Depending on the scope of the service agreement, the Service provider may charge a flat fee for regular maintenance and on an individual invoice basis for additional repairs and spare parts. Usually, the OEM of the elevator or escalator product has an advantage in winning a service contract for its own products. Participants in the elevator and escalator market however also have the ability to service the products of third parties, provided they have the required technical expertise internally available. This can be a further valuable revenue stream for Service providers at various points throughout a product’s lifecycle as contracts come up for renewal. 127 ----- While the elevator and escalator Service business is primarily local in its operation, Service providers benefit from greater scale as they are able to maintain more competitive cost structures, network density and technological leadership. Having a dense network of service branches with technicians trained on all types of elevator and escalator units enables providers to increase their market coverage and further solidify their brand reputation. Greater scale also allows for operational efficiencies such as faster sourcing of spare parts. Moreover, recent technological advancements, such as those in the IoT landscape, allow Service providers with global reach to further benefit from their scale as they are able to develop efficient service solutions based on their deep experience in the field across regions. IoT solutions include real-time diagnosis and reporting of events by the elevator itself to a Service provider’s service center, which can reduce product downtime, add value for the Service customer and make service technicians more efficient. The advantages of IoT-powered maintenance solutions have the potential to not only improve an OEM’s conversion rate from New Installations units to recurring service contracts, they also help ensure customer retention over the long-term.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655
291_2,Offering 2020.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.1,Overview of the Elevator and Escalator Market,18.1.3,Modernization,"As an elevator or escalator ages, it requires increasing amounts of maintenance to operate efficiently and maintain compliance with local regulations. Maintenance expenses for older systems also tend to increase as spare parts become outdated and therefore less common. Modernization helps solve these issues by providing customers with a range of options to prolong the usable life of an elevator or escalator system and postpone a more capital-intensive full replacement. With the age of the installed base of escalators and elevators generally increasing across regions, Modernizations represent a further source of recurring revenue alongside the New Installation and Service businesses. Modernizations can range from the replacement or upgrade of a single component (such as a traction machine) to the exchange of an entire system within a building (with a result akin to a New Installations project). OEMs seek to win modernization work from both existing Service customers and from new customers. Many modernization providers have the ability to modernize third-party elevator or escalator systems in addition to their own systems, representing opportunities to expand their installed base. The large and aging global installed base means that OEMs have the potential to derive significant recurring revenues from modernization customers. Moreover, OEMs have the potential to convert the modernized units into service contracts, increasing their number of units under maintenance. 128 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,655
291_2,Offering 2020.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.1,Overview of the Elevator and Escalator Market,18.1.4,,"We are primarily active in the elevator and escalator market (referred to as “E&E”). The E&E market is worth approximately €56 billion (excluding Japan) according to the Market Size/Growth Analysis, and there are approximately 16 million elevators and escalators installed globally, with more than 900,000 new units installed each year. The E&E market encompasses (i) elevators for office buildings, apartment buildings, shopping centers, hotels, hospitals, train and metro stations, airports and other similar applications and (ii) escalators and moving walks with the ability to handle heavy traffic and frequent use utilized in a broad range of applications. A mixture of global, pure play elevator and escalator manufacturers, industrial conglomerates with elevator and escalator divisions and smaller regional and local companies make up the competitive landscape of the elevator and escalator market. For buyers of elevator and escalator products, key purchasing criteria include price (in particular for new installation tenders), customer relationships, brand reputation, operational scale, cost of ownership, terms of maintenance and repair services, efficiency and innovative product offerings. With a relatively fragmented, localized customer base and a diverse regulatory environment, local expertise is important to obtain both new installation and recurring service contracts. Elevators are typically divided into high-, mid- and low-rise categories, with varying regulatory and technical requirements. High-rise units generally serve commercial applications above 100 meters. Mid-rise units usually serve commercial or public projects with a height of 45-100 meters. Low-rise units mostly serve residential projects under 45 meters. Due to regional differences in product demand and regulation, elevator and escalator products from a manufacturer may also differ depending on the location of the intended customer. Within the elevator and escalator market, there are generally three discrete lines of business driven by the product lifecycle and customer relationship: New Installation, Services and Modernizations. After their initial manufacture and installation, elevators and escalators require continuous maintenance throughout their lifespan before requiring varying levels of modernization. The graphic below illustrates the typical sales lifecycle for an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) alongside the customer relationship for an elevator or escalator: **>90%** Retention rate 3[rd] party wins 10-20 years elevator lifetime prior to significant Modernization 3[rd] party wins New Manufacturing Selling Installation InstallationInstallation & Supply Chain **70 – 80%** Conversion rate",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

Excludes Japan There are approximately 16 million elevators and escalators currently installed globally, and over 900,000 new elevators and escalators are being installed each year, supported by an estimated increase in growth in China and ongoing growth in construction activity driving New Installations. Today, the global population, and in particular the urban population, continues to grow. More than 200,000 people move to cities each day (Source: United Nations, 2018). By 2050, the number of urban inhabitants is expected to increase by 55%, from approximately 4 billion today to nearly 7 billion (Source: United Nations, 2018). Within cities there is an increasing demand for better access and convenience, renovation activity of existing infrastructure, new large-scale infrastructure and urban living projects and demand for innovative products. As elevators and escalators are an inherent component of the residential and commercial multi-story buildings that characterize urban environments, this will drive structural growth for the elevator and escalator market. The elevator and escalator New Installations market is forecast to grow at a 1.7% CAGR between 2019 and 2024, driven in part by solid global macroeconomic output and construction output (source: Market Size/ Growth Analysis). Based on forecasts incorporating the COVID-19 impact, global residential construction spending is expected to decline by 1.5% in 2020 (compared to +1.9% growth expected pre-COVID-19 outbreak) and global non-residential construction is expected to decline by 1.7% (compared to +1.5% growth expected pre-COVID-19 outbreak) (source: IHS). The medium term outlook remains positive with global residential spending projected to grow at a 1.7% CAGR 19-24E and non-residential structures spending projected to increase at a 1.6% CAGR 19-24E (source: IHS). 129 ----- The elevator and escalator Service market is also forecast to outpace the greater global market with a 3.9% CAGR between 2019 and 2024, driven by increasing regulatory requirements and customer demands for safety and convenience as well as appreciation of service quality. This is particularly relevant in highly regulated and developed markets such as North America and Europe, with an ageing installed base. The elevator and escalator market is subject to a variety of laws and regulations which require the owners of elevator and escalator systems to invest in maintenance to ensure their systems are operating safely. The need for maintenance of a growing installed base is expected to fuel Service growth. In addition, the elevator and escalator modernization market is forecast to grow at a 6.9% CAGR between 2019 and 2024. As the installed base of elevators and escalators ages, property owners increasingly need to invest in modernization of their elevators and escalators to further ensure they comply with applicable regulatory requirements and continue to operate safely and efficiently. The trend towards sophisticated IoT solutions and general digitalization of transportation technologies is also estimated to support growth in the elevator and escalator Service market, as customers across regions demand increasing levels of service quality and uptime from their products.

We have delivered resilient sales and Adjusted EBIT margins since the 2007/2008 Financial Year. Despite negative currency effects in recent financial years, our sales have increased from €7,674 million in the 2016/2017 Financial Year to €8,048 million in the twelve months ended March 31, 2020, highlighting the stability of our business and our ability to maintain our sales and profitability over the economic cycle despite external pressures. The main driver of the resilience and stability of our overall business is the life cycle of our business model. Our New Installation business is a key driver of our growing installed base and units under maintenance and therefore is the entry gate to our Service and Modernization business. The Service business generates revenue streams that include fees for regular maintenance and income from repairs and spare parts. The strong profitability and the 136 ----- asset-light character of our Service business contribute to our high cash generation. For the 2016/2017, 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 Financial Years, 70% to 80% of our New Installation units converted into Service units. In each of the 2016/2017, 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 Financial Years, the Service business maintained a global retention rate of over 90%. Many of our Service business customers eventually become customers of our Modernization business, which offers us the opportunity to generate revenue from retrofitting or replacing entire systems of elevators and escalators while continuing the customer relationship. In addition, we attract many Service customers whose elevator and escalator systems were manufactured and installed by third parties, adding to our steady Service and Modernization revenue streams. The high resilience of our business is also driven by a diversified customer base with long-term contracts and high customer retention rates and a balanced global footprint, minimizing both customer and geographic concentration risks. Our top ten customers accounted for less than 3% of sales in each of the 2016/2017, 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 Financial Years. Geographically, our elevator and escalator operations (including manufacturing facilities, service centers and employees) are divided across three Operating Segments: the Americas, Europe/Africa and Asia/Pacific, which accounted for 41%, 26% and 28% of our Operating Segment’s total sales, respectively, in the twelve months ended March 31, 2020. Our fourth Operating Segment, the Access Solutions division, operates globally and generated 5% of our Operating Segments’ total sales for the same period. The resilience of our business model is demonstrated by our financial performance during periods of worldwide economic distress. For example, during the global financial crisis, our total Adjusted EBIT margin and sales remained stable between the 2008/2009 Financial Year and the 2009/2010 Financial Year. Most recently, we have been able to successfully manage and limit the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business by having immediately implemented contingency measures, which we believe further proves the resilience of our business model through the economic cycles.

291_2,Offering 2020.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.12,Our Competitive Strengths,18.12.3,Highly attractive industry with structural growth drivers,"We operate in the global elevator and escalator market, which generated sales of €55.8 billion in 2019 worldwide (excluding Japan). The global elevator and escalator market grew at a CAGR of 1.7% between 2014 and 2019, and prior to taking into account the impact of COVID-19, was expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.3% between 2019 and 2024, above expected real GDP growth. Specifically, between 2019 and 2024, the new installation, service and modernization businesses were expected to grow at a CAGR of 1.7%, 3.9% and 6.9%, respectively. This growth is underpinned by structural factors and megatrends, including increasing urbanization, an aging population, a supportive regulatory environment and sustainability and digitalization trends. Increasing urbanization is one of the primary drivers for the need for more urban spaces worldwide, which increases demand for elevators and escalators, as they are an inherent component of the residential and commercial multi-story buildings that characterize urban environments. By 2050, the number of urban inhabitants is expected to increase by 55%, from approximately four billion today to nearly seven billion. In particular, the urban population is expected to increase in emerging markets, including from approximately 60% in 2018 to 80% in 2050 in China. This trend positively affects the growth of the elevator and escalator market, as urban residents increasingly demand the access and convenience provided by elevators and escalators, particularly in cities in the developed world where large-scale urban living and infrastructure projects (such as hospitals, shopping malls and train stations) are increasingly required to offer fast and efficient urban mobility solutions. Growth in the elevator and escalator market is also driven by an increasingly aging population. The ratio of people over the age of 65 years to those under the age of five years is expected to rise from approximately 1:1 in 2019 to 2:1 in 2050. This trend is likely to support demand for elevator and escalator solutions as well as home access solutions for stairs, as the growing aging population will need or prefer the mobility afforded by elevators, escalators and home access solutions. In addition, growth in the elevator and escalator market is driven by a supportive regulatory environment, which requires the owners of elevator and escalator systems to invest in basic maintenance services to ensure their systems are consistently operating safely. Currently, over 50% of elevators in North America and Europe are over 20 years old. As the installed base of elevators and escalators grows and ages, property owners are increasingly in need of modernizing their elevators and escalators to ensure they comply with applicable regulatory requirements and continue to operate safely. In Asia/Pacific, including China and South Korea, we believe that there is a particularly strong opportunity to grow our Service and Modernization businesses driven by the aging of the installed base in those markets and stricter safety regulations requiring regular maintenance and upgrades. 137 ----- We believe that long-term growth in the elevator and escalator market will also be positively impacted by a continued focus on digitalization, connectivity and sustainability, as customers increasingly value features such as improved energy efficiency and enhanced safety and maintenance monitoring. According to the Market Size/ _Growth Analysis, the market for buildings with digitally automated operations or “smart buildings” is expected to_ grow at 5% per annum through 2024. We believe that our current innovative smart mobility solutions and our strong research and development capabilities position us to benefit from this demand. For example, our TWIN elevator system (“TWIN”), which combines two independent cars in one shaft, can already reduce energy costs by up to 25% and increase usable floor space by up to 25%. In addition we estimate that our MULTI system, which we are in the process of developing and will be the world’s first rope-free elevator, will allow for space reductions of up to a further 30% to 50% compared to our TWIN system. We aim to consistently increase product efficiency and provide additional value-add to our customers across our portfolio of new and existing products and services.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

We have been able to successfully monetize IoT and digital opportunities, as demonstrated by our recently developed MAX technology and our proprietary IT system, VIEW. MAX is a cloud-based maintenance tool which utilizes IoT technologies to collect data relating to customer elevator units and make diagnostic recommendations, such as when repairs need to be undertaken or which critical parts need to be replaced. VIEW is an operational business steering tool, which, among other things, automatically dispatches qualified technicians to resolve the problems identified by MAX, often even before any visible operational issues occur. Leveraging our expertise in IoT and other digital tools enables us to improve customer satisfaction by increasing service quality and efficiency, thereby increasing our customer retention rates and decreasing cancellation rates. In addition, we believe that we have created some of the most innovative elevator concepts currently in operation in the market. We are the only supplier in the industry to have an offering similar to our TWIN elevator system, which combines two independent cars in one shaft. We are also currently in the process of developing the MULTI system, which would be the world’s first rope-free elevator, allowing for space reductions of up to a further 30% to 50% compared to our TWIN system.

Our Elevator and Escalator division has grown consistently over the years, with our Adjusted EBIT margin generally increasing since the 2011/2012 Financial Year until the 2016/2017 Financial Year. While facing some headwinds, especially from material price developments and trade tariffs implemented in recent years, we believe that, following the Transactions, there will be greater opportunity to increase our Adjusted EBIT margin. Our business benefits from high revenue visibility given the recurring and stable nature of our Service and Modernization business model. Our New Installation business represents the key enabler for growth of Service and Modernization by growing our units under maintenance and offering high visibility of future business performance due to long order-to-fulfilment times. Most of our New Installation units are converted into maintenance units, which propels our Service business. Our Service contracts on average have a gross profit margin of approximately 40%, which progressively increases over the elevator’s lifetime due to increased spare parts sales. Many of our Service business customers eventually become customers of our Modernization business, driven by an aging installed base with the need to upgrade and extend the life cycle of the elevators and escalators. The Service and Modernization businesses, which together accounted for 54% of sales and around 70% of gross profit for the 2018/2019 Financial Year, are a source of stable, recurring sales and high profit margins for the Group. Our Service contracts have an average length between one to five years. Our full life cycle business model, with our high conversion and retention rates across businesses and long-term customer relationships, enables high visibility on recurring future earnings. 138 ----- The following graph illustrates how the elevator life-cycles allow high visibility on future recurring earnings: t h y s s e n k r u p p E l e v a t o r v a l u e c h a i n ( i l l u s t r a t i v e ) Elevator lifetime: c. 10-20 years of elevator lifetime prior to significant Modernization Time Maintenance fee Spare parts Maintenance Maintenance Maintenance Maintenance Maintenance Contract Contract Contract Contract Contract The profitability of our business is also driven by our fully invested global foothold, which requires limited capital expenditure and working capital given our asset-light business model, resulting in a strong cash flow profile. Our elevator technology business has significantly increased cash generation since 2011/2012, roughly doubling its business cash flow through generating higher profits and reducing operating net working capital by approximately 80%. Our cash conversion rate was approximately 90% in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. Excluding certain one-off expenditures incurred from time to time (such as €3 million, €6 million and €106 million for major mergers and acquisition projects in the 2016/2017, 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 Financial Years (including the acquisitions of Nashville Machine’s elevator division and O’Keefe Elevator Company, Inc.) as well as carve-out related one-time expenditures of €1,080 million paid in connection with the Licensing Agreement fee for use of the “thyssenkrupp” brand and of €74 million for carve-out related real estate transfers, in both cases, in the 2018/2019 Financial Year), our capital expenditures were €145 million, €115 million, and €129 million for the 2016/2017 Financial Year, the 2017/2018 Financial Year and the 2018/2019 Financial Year, respectively, highlighting our generally stable and relatively limited capital investment requirements. See “Summary Financial and Other Data—Other Financial, Operating and Pro Forma Information—Other _Financial and Operating Information.” We believe that the development of business cash flow and cash_ conversion over the last three financial years demonstrates that we operate an asset-light business with relatively low capital requirements and high cash returns. In addition, we believe our business offers significant operational improvement potential and profitability upside. We have recently implemented several cost optimization initiatives that we believe will generate greater margins. For example, we have restructured our manufacturing operations by optimizing our footprint and leveraging shared services and best practices, as well as streamlining our product offerings. These initiatives have led to stable development in cost of goods sold by partially offsetting personnel cost inflation through efficiency measures and headcount management, and compensating for material cost increases through purchasing measures and the improved management of procurement volume. These efficiency measures have also reduced SG&A costs as a percentage of sales from 18.5% in the 2016/2017 Financial Year to 16.4% in the twelve months ended March 31, 2020. In addition, following the Acquisition, we expect to realize an additional estimated €240 million in potential cost savings within 15 to 18 months after July 1, 2020 as part of the Sponsors’ transformation program (the “Transformation Program”).

We target growth in our Service business due to customer demand for high quality services with short lead times, and through reducing cancellation rates and winning service contracts for third-party installations. We also target growth in both our Service and Modernization businesses driven by increases in the average age of the installed base of elevators and escalators in the region and a strict regulatory environment. In Europe/Africa, we expect that the large, aging installed base of elevators and escalators, supported by a strict regulatory environment and high customer retention and conversion rates, will generate attractive service and modernization opportunities. We further expect that strong construction output, particularly from the residential segment and a slight recovery in Southern Europe as well as a more competitive product offering due to our manufacturing optimization initiatives in Spain and Germany, will drive our New Installation business and, consequently, growth in our Service and Modernization businesses. 140 ----- In Asia/Pacific, we aim to benefit from the anticipated growth of the new installations market, targeting robust expansion of our New Installation business, including in India and other markets. We believe that growing customer demand for high quality services and an expanding installed base will also contribute to growth in our Service and Modernization businesses. We expect that an expanding installed base of elevators and escalators and the growing importance of IoT solutions, particularly in South Korea, will lead to strong growth opportunities in our Service and Modernization businesses. We expect China, the largest elevator and escalator market in Asia, will continue to generate our highest New Installation growth globally, and that conversion of many of these newly installed units to Service contracts will continue to drive growth in the Service business. We believe that there is a particularly strong opportunity to grow our Service and Modernization businesses in China and other developing markets, driven by the growth and the aging of the installed base in those markets and stricter safety regulations requiring regular maintenance and upgrades, which many emerging market countries are adopting as their regulatory systems mature.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655
291_2,Offering 2020.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.13,Our Strategies,18.13.2,Core Strategy: Realize structural profitability upside,"Our Core strategy consists of realizing structural profitability upside by focusing on (i) standardization within our New Installation business, (ii) manufacturing optimization, (iii) service and modernization growth and digitalization, (iv) selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) cost reduction and (v) procurement optimization. In addition, following the Acquisition, we expect to realize additional cost savings as part of the Sponsors’ Transformation Program. _Standardization of Our New Installation Business_ We plan to continue to drive the standardization of our New Installation business by simplifying the amount and types of products and components we offer our customers. Historically, in part due to our strategy of growing through acquisitions, we provided customers with a large share of customized product solutions. This resulted in a highly diverse but overlapping product portfolio and limited price competitiveness due to the high costs of designing and producing such a wide range of individualized products. In order to optimize our structure, we are in the process of simplifying our regional product portfolio and standardizing certain components. For example, the number of product platforms in the Group has been reduced by more than half in the last decade as part of a process of implementing a simplified portfolio structure with further improvements planned going forward. In Europe, we have streamlined our major platforms down to two, which cover 80% of our products. This has resulted in synergies and a strong evolution of order intake in the first half of 2019/2020 while not impacting customers’ perception of our product offering or quantity of sales. We believe this will lead us to benefit from economies of scales, focusing our resource allocation more efficiently and allowing us to provide a more cost-competitive offering without compromising on customer service. In addition, we have also standardized and harmonized components across products to allow specific modular components, such as traction machines, controllers/inverters and doors, to be used across multiple product platforms, which we expect will result in lower costs due to the use of fewer parts, a leaner set-up, less complexity, higher agility and easier external sourcing. These initiatives are aimed at focusing our sales teams on value-based selling by presenting customers with a harmonized product portfolio of key high quality, high margin products. We plan to adapt our manufacturing to focus on products that provide our customers with one of three customization levels for low-rise buildings (less than 45 meters), mid-rise buildings (between 45 and 100 meters) and high-rise buildings (above 100 meters). These customization levels comprise: (i) Value for Money “100,” which is our lower priced option with no customization; (ii) Performance “200,” which is our moderately priced option with medium customization; and (iii) Customization “300,” which is our high priced option with full customization. This value proposition model offers customers flexible and transparent pricing, which we expect will make our products especially compelling to customers in high-volume and growth markets, such as large property developers in Asia/Pacific. Our processes, in turn, will be optimized by focusing on a leaner offering and steering our salesforces and engineers toward a focus on sales efforts based on product margin potentials and the conversion of New Installation units into Service contracts and later into Modernization sales. _Manufacturing Optimization_ We are engaged in an ongoing effort to optimize our manufacturing operations. These measures have included closing and, where possible, consolidating manufacturing sites, increasing outsourcing of standardized products and developing factories with improved technology for greater automation. For example, in Asia/Pacific, we 141 ----- have established leaner manufacturing operations, with a newly established plant in India and advances in automation at our plants in China and South Korea. In the Americas, we have consolidated all North America manufacturing at our Middleton facility to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. In Europe/Africa, we have shifted our factories away from a regional focus (in which a particular factory only serves specific countries) to a model where all factories can deliver to the entire Europe/Africa region, with each factory having a dedicated product focus. As part of this shift, we have restructured our Móstoles plant in Spain and we are currently restructuring our operations in Germany to reduce costs and simplify production. In the long term, we aim to move away from a classic factory model, where the focus is on major production and shipping of complete elevator systems and requires high personnel expenses, towards a model where we produce only key, mission critical components and outsource commoditized parts, resulting in lower fixed costs and higher productivity. _Service and Modernization Growth and Digitalization_ We aim to deliver service growth through leveraging our attractive business model and IoT innovation technology. Our business model contributes to the growth of our Service and Modernization business as, on average, 70% to 80% of New Installation contracts convert into Service contracts, and many of those Service business customers eventually become customers of the Modernization business. We aim to grow our Service business, which is a source of stable and recurring sales and high margins, by pursuing multiple initiatives aimed at increasing revenues per unit while decreasing costs. In particular, we believe that our use of digital and IoT technologies, including the recently developed MAX and VIEW systems, will enable us to improve customer satisfaction by increasing service quality and efficiency, and thereby increase customer retention rates and decrease cancellation rates. Particularly, in North America, our Service business growth is driven by the reduction of cancellation rates. We have already improved our cancellation rates and we aim to reduce our cancellation rates further through strict management focus and tools like the MAX and VIEW. We expect the growth of our Service business will contribute to new Modernization customers as the installed base grows and ages, generating an additional stream of stable and recurring revenues. We also believe that we can leverage the scale and efficiency gains achieved by MAX and VIEW to reduce the costs per unit of providing services, such as technician travel time and spare parts. In addition, we intend to increase our rate of winning customers away from competitor service providers by enhancing the efficiency of our spare parts organization, increasing our service training and leveraging the superior quality of our Service business and our capability to refurbish multi-brand spare parts through our ITS unit. _SG&A costs optimization_ We aim to reduce SG&A costs by centralizing administrative functions, adopting a range of organizational efficiency measures and improving our IT systems. Specifically, we are engaged in an ongoing effort to combine a wide array of administrative processes that historically have been performed locally, such as billing, payroll and purchasing, into shared service centers. For example, in the United States, we are in the process of consolidating these functions, previously spread over 18 locations, into one shared service center at the US headquarters in Atlanta, and we intend to roll out a similar strategy in Europe and Asia. We are also in the process of harmonizing our IT processes by rolling out VIEW globally, continuing to transition to cloud-based services, adopting global templates and standards, “delayering,” or flattening, management levels to simplify our organization and reduce overhead costs and adopting other efficiency enhancements. These measures have resulted in more than €80 million in total cost savings over the last three financial years. _Procurement Optimization_ Finally, throughout our Core strategy, we aim to reduce our procurement costs by optimizing our supply chains through commercial measures, such as, for example, supplier days, clustering managed spend, and engaging in e-auctions, continuing from measures implemented historically. For example, between the 2011/2012 Financial Year and the 2018/2019 Financial Year, our purchasing savings increased by 300%, outpacing our procurement spend which increased by 50%. _Transformation Program_ Following the Acquisition, we expect to realize €240 million in potential cost savings by September 30, 2021 through the Sponsors’ Transformation Program, assuming the program will be implemented beginning on July 1, 2020 and driven by key management, including the Chief Executive Officer of the Group. The Transformation Program focuses on cost savings opportunities related to (i) commercial operations, (ii) service operations, (iii) procurement costs, (iv) G&A costs and (v) other operational costs. Some of these initiatives will be continued through the efficiency measures, which we are already in the process of implementing, as described above. 142 ----- As part of our commercial operations initiatives under the Transformation Program, we aim to improve our organizational efficiency by restructuring and centralizing our sales supports team, including by shifting employees to low cost countries. In addition, we seek to increase our sales force productivity through various measures, including improving our administrative processes and completing faster technical sales. This is facilitated by our offering of fewer customization options resulting from the optimization of our product and service portfolios. We also intend to increase our focus on sales efforts based on product margin potentials and the conversion of New Installation units into Service contracts and later into Modernization sales. We expect to realize cost savings in an aggregate amount of €7 million related to our commercial operations initiatives. As part of our service operations initiatives under the Transformation Program, we aim to improve our organizational efficiency by rationalizing the number of our application engineers, reducing the number of platforms in our offering, standardizing our service offering and reducing the number of our service centers, particularly in the U.S. We intend to implement other measures under these initiatives as well, including improving process, technology and performance management in order to increase the productivity of our service technicians. We expect to realize cost savings in an aggregate amount of €15 million related to our service operations initiatives. As part of our procurement initiatives under the Transformation Program, we intend to implement multiple measures to reduce costs relating to our procurement activities. For the 2018/2019 Financial Year, we believe that our estimated addressable cost base for procurement activities comprised €2.1 billion of direct costs and €0.5 billion of indirect costs. To reduce these costs, we intend to establish group-wide supply agreements with global suppliers for key categories of direct materials, such as motors, cables and doors, including through leveraging change-of-control provisions under our existing supplier agreements with local or regional suppliers. We also expect to increase our focus on supplier driven innovation in connection with, among other things, tendering processes. To pursue improvements in specification management, we seek to standardize purchases for complex parts and establish business unit sourcing boards, which will act as advisory panels in key end markets to promote best practices and streamline procurement processes. Furthermore, we continue to shift our relationships with local suppliers to regional suppliers in order to both increase the number of sites served by our suppliers and decrease the number of our total suppliers, resulting in increased efficiencies. We also continue to streamline the amount and variety of individually supplied components in order to purchase bundles of different products and higher volumes of specific products, resulting in improved purchasing ability. Moreover, where appropriate, we target shifting to agreements with suppliers in low cost countries or otherwise shifting purchases from our suppliers of local products to products sourced from low cost countries. In addition, we are working to utilize both centralized regional lead-buyers to streamline demand-management processes and defined sourcing hubs to allow for best value and benchmark sourcing through increased spend, price and margin transparency. Furthermore, we expect to realize cost savings from our commercial operations initiatives that result in the rationalization of our product offering and standardization of our SKUs. We expect to realize cost savings in an aggregate amount of €132 million in connection with our procurement initiatives. As part of our G&A cost savings initiatives under the Transformation Program, we aim to improve our organizational efficiency and generate attrition savings through a leaner operating model, the shifting of employees to low cost countries and increased automation, including within our shared service centers. We expect to realize cost savings in an aggregate amount of €36 million related to our G&A cost savings initiatives. As part of our other operational initiatives under the Transformation Program, we aim to reduce direct and indirect personnel expenses and scrappage costs by decreasing the portion of poor quality production. We target replicating the cost of poor quality levels that we have achieved at our Korean plant (where such costs are estimated to be 0.6% of internal sales) at our other plants, particularly our Middleton plant. We also intend to outsource parts and components and streamline production overhead and assembly processes to reduce costs. We expect to realize cost savings in an aggregate amount of €50 million related to our other operational initiatives. We expect to incur one-off costs amounting to between €240 and €294 million in connection with these initiatives, mainly as a result of (i) voluntary redundancy, early retirement and other severance costs, (ii) staff training costs, (iii) investments in IT to digitize, automate and streamline processes, (iv) investments in the existing shared service centers in Europe, Brazil and the U.S., as well as potentially operating new, regional centers in Eastern Europe and Asia and (v) consulting, financial and legal advisory fees in connection with implementing these initiatives.

We have a long-standing German engineering heritage and a history of innovative digital solutions with the potential to transform the Elevator and Escalator division. We are a leading innovator in the elevator and escalator market and strive to address what we believe are fundamental technological challenges to better serve a rapidly urbanizing society. For example, we estimate that up to 40% of usable space in buildings is utilized for elevator shafts. Our TWIN elevator system combines two independent cars in one shaft in order to increase efficiency and creates more usable area by using up to 25% less usable space than an ordinary elevator. The TWIN elevator system’s unique value-add has made it a top choice for premier buildings around the world, including the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, Germany, and the CMA Tower in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. We believe that our MULTI elevator system, which is currently in the developing phase, has the potential to be even more compelling to the market. MULTI is a rope-less elevator able to move both vertically and horizontally, which will allow new architectural designs and unlimited building height and, we estimate, will use up to 30% to 50% less usable space than an ordinary elevator. We believe that our New Installation customers place a high value on innovative solutions like TWIN and MULTI, which both have the potential to significantly increase the usable area in buildings that is available for sale or rent. We also aim to continue to monetize our IoT technologies more effectively in the future to create sustainable business value and cash flow. By the 2021/2022 Financial Year, we aim to charge connection and monthly fees to customers for using MAX, which already supported the servicing of over 129,000 units as of March 31, 2020. Other innovations currently in the pipeline include our asset performance management solution as well as our Intelligent Gate Management System, part of our Access Solutions division. We plan to follow the MAX blueprint for these and other new products by clearly demonstrating the value of the product after launch, bringing the technology to maturity and then developing a pricing and sales model that accurately reflects our value to customers. In addition, we have a track record of successful mergers and acquisitions, including most recently our acquisitions of Nashville Machine’s elevator division and O’Keefe Elevator Company, Inc. in the 2018/2019 Financial Year. We plan to further develop our profit potential by opportunistically seeking future M&A targets, which we believe can be value accretive to the Group.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

Both companies separately evolved into major industrial conglomerates until they were combined into thyssenkrupp through a merger in 1999. While the Elevator Technology Business was historically integrated with thyssenkrupp’s operations, thyssenkrupp began a separation process to facilitate the Acquisition in 2019. On December 31, 2019, all assets and liabilities that form part of the Elevator Technology Business were transferred to thyssenkrupp Elevator Holding GmbH, which was subsequently converted to an Aktiengesellschaft and renamed as thyssenkrupp Elevator AG (the “Target”). thyssenkrupp Elevator AG is the top holding company of the Elevator Technology Business, the sole shareholder of thyssenkrupp Elevator Innovation and thyssenkrupp Elevator Holding and a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of thyssenkrupp AG. The Elevator Technology Business was incepted in the second half of the 20th century, when the industrial conglomerate that is now thyssenkrupp acquired several elevator manufacturers in Germany and Western Europe, including Rheinstahl AG, a specialist in the construction and installation of transportation equipment, elevators, escalators and jet bridges. Leveraging this new industry experience and its German engineering heritage, the Elevator Technology Business flourished and soon delivered major advances in elevator and escalator technology. Building on its early success in Europe, thyssenkrupp continued to broaden its footprint in the global elevator and escalator market through further acquisitions in Germany, Canada, the Netherlands and the United States in the 1980s and 1990s, which also expanded its service scope into home solutions such as chairlifts. Having constructed a dedicated elevator factory in Neuhausen, near Stuttgart, Germany in the 1970s, thyssenkrupp further expanded its production capacities as the Elevator Technology Business continued to grow, adding an escalator factory in Spain in 1991 and an elevator and escalator factory in Zhongshan, China in 1995, which also marked the business’s entry into the Asia/Pacific region. After the turn of the century, thyssenkrupp made targeted acquisitions to further build up its market position, primarily including the purchase of KONE 144 ----- Oy’s Latin America business in 2001, Tepper Aufzüge in 2003, Dongyang Elevator Co., Ltd.

We cover the entire design and installation of elevator systems for all major markets and industry types. Some of our recent credentials include the Hudson Yards development and the One World Trade Center, New York, the Beijing International Airport T3 Terminal and the Federation Tower, Russia. We provide elevator solutions for office buildings, apartment buildings, shopping centers, hotels, hospitals, train and metro stations, airports and other similar applications. This includes the design, manufacture and installation of traction drive elevators (driven by electric motor and cable), with or without a machine room, and hydraulic drive elevators (driven by hydraulic cylinder). In North America, hydraulic drive elevators are more commonly used, compared to the rest of the world, where traction drive elevators are more common. We cover all classes and applications, from economical residential to more demanding commercial projects. These include low-rise, mid- rise and high-rise solutions; as well as several innovative high-end elevator technologies. Our offerings are driven by demand in the relevant markets, as well as applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Where possible, we strive to utilize the same components (such as doors, controllers and traction machines) across product types and models. However, since each elevator must be tailored to the specific building and the regulatory requirements of the jurisdiction where it is installed, there can be significant differences between individual elevators from the same product line. We aim to categorize our product lines into three platforms, including solutions for low-rise, mid-rise and highrise buildings. Each product platform generally offers three primary options with regards to their performance, durability and customization level: “Value for Money” (no customization), “Performance” (medium customization) and “Customization” (full customization). We offer four core elevator product lines, which may be marketed under different brands in certain regions. A product line forms the basis for each individual elevator’s design, which we develop in accordance with each customer’s specific customization needs and the applicable local technical and regulatory requirements. Accordingly, elevators from the same product line can have different technical specifications when installed in different regions of the world. We also offer additional elevator products to provide greater client-driven optionality. Our four core elevator product lines are described below: - _evolution / meta—Our Americas and Europe/Africa segments market the evolution elevator product line in the Americas, Europe and Africa. Our Asia/Pacific segment offers a product that is similar to the “evolution” elevator product line under the meta brand. - _momentum / zeta—Our Americas and Europe/Africa segments also offer the momentum elevator product line across the Americas, Europe and Africa. Our Asia/Pacific segment offers a similar product under the _zeta brand._ - _synergy / enta—The Europe/Africa segment offers the synergy product line, which is primarily meant for low-rise constructions. Our Asia/Pacific segment offers a similar product under the enta brand. - _endura—The Americas segment also sells the endura product line, which is a hydraulic model in accordance with the technological preference in North America. 147 ----- Our core elevator product lines’ key features are illustrated below: ## Customization Level #### Value for money (“100”) #### Performance (“200”) #### Customization (“300”) #### Standard process, few options #### More flexible, allowing certain modifications #### Full customization for appropriate price momentum 300 zeta 300 #### High rise >100m Mid rise 45-100m momentum 200 zeta 200 evolution 300 enta 300 meta 100 evolution 200 meta 200 synergy 200 endura1 enta 200 synergy 300 #### Low rise <45m enta 100 synergy 100 (1) Local hydraulic product for the U.S. market. Maximum travel height of 18 meters. In addition to our core product lines described above, we also sell freight elevators and other specialized elevators tailored to serve specific transportation purposes, as well as our innovative products and solutions. These include the following: - _TWIN—The TWIN elevator system has two separate cars which are arranged on top of one another within the same single elevator shaft and operate independently of one another. The TWIN allows one elevator shaft to handle up to 40% more passengers and to save labor and material expenses since only one elevator shaft is needed for two cars. This increases leasable and otherwise usable space in buildings by up to 25%. The TWIN has made it a top choice for premier buildings throughout the world, including the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, Germany and the CMA Tower in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. - _MULTI—The MULTI elevator system is expected to be the world’s first rope-less, linear motor driven elevator system. It is designed to operate with multiple cars existing within one shaft, and also to move seamlessly between horizontal and vertical shafts within a building. In a practical sense, this reduces passenger wait times, significantly increases potential passenger capacity and reduces elevator weight and mass for energy reduction and increased usable space in building design. While TWIN saves up to 25% of usable space in buildings, the MULTI increases those savings up to approximately 30-50% in high-rise buildings. Beyond these practical benefits, the MULTI’s unique design also opens up a significant range of new possibilities for architects in the design of modern buildings by removing the building height and breadth restrictions presented by traditional elevator systems. The MULTI system is currently in prototype design stage with a test version running in our test tower in Rottweil, Germany. In addition, we also manufacture solutions to enhance the efficiency of existing elevator systems. For instance, our AGILE solution, which is a digital user interface and building management system, based on the IoT technology, allows building managers to intelligently group and assign passengers to elevators and facilitate rapid movement of people to their destination. AGILE comes with four core elements, which revolve around destination control, enhanced security, a design center featuring a touch screen interface and an elevator management center. _Escalator and Moving Walk Products_ Our escalators and moving walk product lines provide state-of-the-art technology and have the ability to handle heavy traffic and frequent use. Similar to our capabilities in the elevator market, we are able to develop, 148 ----- manufacture and install top-quality escalators and moving walks for the most demanding projects. Our escalator and moving walk offerings include products for all applications, including train stations, airports and office buildings, and are designed to meet the highest operational and safety standards. Escalators and moving walks traditionally consist of a robust drive unit/electric motor, steps, handrail/balustrade, step chain, truss, coverings of various materials and a central control unit. We customize these elements in close cooperation with each particular customer for any of our product lines. Many of the world’s largest recent infrastructure and commercial building projects have featured our escalators, including the Lester B. Pearson International Airport, Toronto, the Indira Gandhi International Airport, New Delhi, the One World Trade Center, New York, as well as the Amsterdam and Shenzhen metro networks. We offer three types of escalators, with minor regional variations, each helping to move passengers safely, efficiently and comfortably: - _velino: the velino commercial-duty escalator is designed to preserve the architectural integrity of buildings, and, with our compact dimensions, is ideal for shopping malls. The dual CPU controllers and the optional variable voltage variable frequency (“VVVF”) drive technology, save energy and help keep operating costs low. - _tugela: the tugela heavy-duty escalator is designed for high-rise applications and locations with heavy traffic. Featuring larger motors and chains than the velino, combined with reinforced handrail drives, it is well-suited for convention centers, stadiums, smaller airports or other places where large numbers of people need to be transported. - _victoria: the victoria transit-duty escalator represents our most rugged escalator, ideal for non-stop applications for transport hubs, such as the busiest and most technically challenging metro and train stations, as well as larger airports. It is our most powerful escalator, featuring a specially reinforced drive system capable of delivering nonstop maximum performance throughout the day even when operating at full load capacity. We manufacture three core types of moving walks, which transport passengers safely and quickly to their destination in metro and train stations, airports or other buildings: - _orinoco: the orinoco moving walks offer indoor and outdoor transportation solutions, allowing the transportation of large volumes of passengers carrying luggage and allowing sufficient space to pass standing passengers safely. - _iwalk: the iwalk moving walks offer indoor and outdoor transportation solutions, allowing pit or pit-less installation. To address building settings that offer minimal or no clearance for drive mechanisms directly underneath the moving walk, our iwalk is a modular solution that opens up opportunities for architects and developers. The modular nature of the product means that it can be easily customized, and pieces can be removed for repair or replacement with simply a forklift, requiring minimal or no modification work to the existing structure. - _ACCEL: the ACCEL is our innovative, high-speed moving walk product, which is currently being introduced to the market. Building on linear motor technology that thyssenkrupp first developed for its work on the Transrapid magnetic train project, the new ACCEL moving walk provides an initial speed of 0.65 m/s and then accelerates to 2.0 m/s using a cutting-edge overlapping pallet system and synchronized handrail system. ACCEL is able to transport passengers up to three times faster than a conventional moving walk. In airport terminals, this can reduce connection times between gates by up to 70%, as shown by operations at the Toronto Pearson Airport. _New Installations of Elevators, Escalators and Moving Walks_ New Installations of elevators, escalators and moving walks refer to installations of these products in a new site. Elevators are typically shipped as components and are assembled on site, whereas escalators are assembled in the factory and subsequently shipped as a complete product. The installation work is either carried out by us directly or outsourced to sub-contractors.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655
291_2,Offering 2020.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.17,"Products, Services and Modernizations",18.17.2,Products of the Access Solutions division,"_Airport Solutions_ An airport is often a traveler’s first and last impression of a city or country. Passenger numbers at airports are expected to double until 2037 (Source: The International Air Transport Association, market size (OI) based on 149 ----- _the Target’s internal estimations, public domain data and statistical calculations). We are focused on improving_ a traveler’s critical impressions while also providing intelligent solutions that elevate airport performance and drive industry innovation. Our Airport Solutions, consisting of passenger boarding bridges, related ground support equipment, visual docking guiding systems (VDGS) and intelligent gate management systems (IGMS), serve airports across the world. We are a global player, outfitting some of the largest airport projects. We offer comprehensive and flexible passenger boarding bridge options, which consider customers’ requirements and allow them to select optimal configurations to suit their specific needs. _Passenger boarding bridges_ Noseloader bridges are specifically designed to enable precise docking in areas with restricted aircraft size and/or parking constraints, since they use a telescopic tunnel which extends from the terminal to connect with the aircraft. A hydraulic elevation system ensures smooth operation while automated systems, such as pre-positioning, reduce human error. An apron drive bridge has more free movement by using telescopic, elevation and rotation axes to deliver maximum docking flexibility while taking up minimal space. Our two and three-tunnel models feature customizable steel, glazed glass or steel-and-glass walls. For those terminals that do not provide a direct boarding bridge connection or that present design challenges such as steep inclines, our Bridge Link (the “Bridge Link”) solution provides easy connectivity. These adaptable “fixed tunnels” link the boarding bridge to the building. They are also customized to match the boarding bridge’s look, feel and dimensions for a seamless passenger arrival and departure experience. Our passenger boarding bridges can serve all commercial passenger aircraft, up to the largest in operation, the Airbus A380, and our global footprint allows it to fulfill some of the world’s largest customer orders. Istanbul’s new airport (IST), which opened in April 2019, is outfitted with 143 passenger boarding bridges, all provided by us—our largest single passenger boarding bridge contract to date. We have the most comprehensive passenger boarding bridges in the industry and are able to service our customers along the entire value chain, from New Installations to Services and Modernizations. We have the largest global installation base of passenger boarding bridges, with a market share of approximately 33%. _Ground support equipment_ To support airports in their need to respond to growing air traffic worldwide, we provide ground support equipment such as preconditioned airflow system (PCA) or ground power (400Hz) and potable water units, which are essential to improve aircraft service operations and to avoid tarmac delays. We typically sub-contract this equipment for manufacturing and offer these along with our passenger boarding bridges. _Intelligent gate systems_ Our intelligent gate systems are innovative solutions that help major airports around the world avoid costly ground operation incidents by increasing their gates’ efficiency. Solutions like our integrated management airport system (IMAS) and atlantis (formerly FMT Atlantis) enable monitoring of integrated equipment at the gate, including ground power units (400Hz), visual docking guidance systems, preconditioned air, surveillance cameras and automatic doors. We have a comprehensive offering of digital solutions, which enable real time monitoring of asset operations, automate operations and enable efficient maintenance. We believe that our APIS (formerly FMT APIS) system is the only visual docking guidance systems that delivers 100% accurate aircraft identification, resulting in increased gate safety, decreased turnaround times and reduced environmental impact. We believe that these intelligent solutions simplify formerly time and labor-consuming tasks, reduce human error and deliver a smoother passenger experience, in addition to improving aircraft turnaround times at the gate. Our key strength is to provide the right software for the hardware, which enables a one-stop solution for ensuring that all components work together and ensures safety, reliability and overall quality of our products and services. _Home Solutions_ Our Home Solutions address mobility issues for aging segments of the world’s population as well as those with disabilities by offering products that are robust and reliable. From chairlifts and platform lifts to home elevators, we enable people to move independently and comfortably in their homes and other buildings. _Chairlifts_ Chairlifts eliminate the barrier posed by stairs by providing a seat attached to a track which runs along the staircase. In many cases, chairlifts are retrofitted onto an existing structure, which can make each installation 150 ----- complex and unique. Our chairlifts strive to balance design and functionality, offering optimal accessibility, while meeting ergonomic requirements. We believe that our patented advanced swiveling and leveling (ASL) technologies make our chairlifts among the industry’s best. Both elderly customers and government institutions use our chairlift solutions. We believe we are a technology leader for chairlifts. Our HoloLinc[®] application, of which more than 100 units are already being used in the field, is the world’s first mixed reality chairlift solution, which employs a new headmounted, mixed-reality HoloLinc device from Microsoft to allows our customers and employees to more quickly and accurately measure the space in which a chairlift is to be installed, which we believe reduces overall lead time, helping to reduce customer stress and to lower costs. _Platform lifts_ Our platform lifts provide people in wheelchairs with independent access to areas with inclines or vertical rises, improving access to indoor and outdoor public spaces, such as government buildings, tourist sites and public transportation systems, as well as to private areas. The platform lifts come equipped with ergonomic design elements, including joystick control and safety features. _Home elevators_ Drawing on our decades of experience in commercial elevators, we have developed a line of customized lifts for private homes or standardized lifts for housing construction projects. They can be designed with or without a shaft and can be integrated easily into existing or new homes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

We service approximately 1.4 million units under maintenance as of March 31, 2020. We offer a broad range of Services, from basic oil and grease maintenance to bespoke full-service packages, to ensure highest safety, performance and efficiency of elevators, escalators and moving walks. We also have an ITS Unit, a part of our Elevators and Escalators division, which reverse engineers elevator and escalator products manufactured by third parties to develop capability of providing services for such equipment. Since our products have to be serviced regularly throughout their entire life span, the Service business typically creates a recurring and stable revenue stream for us. Our net sales in the Service business are driven by the conversion of New Installations units into service contracts. This is evidenced by our average conversion rate of approximately 70% to 80% globally (the conversion rate being calculated as the percentage of New Installations units (excluding distributor sales, which do not directly result in access to servicing the relevant units) that have been converted into Service contracts). We also have an average retention rate globally of above 90% for our Service customers (calculated as units under maintenance at the end of the year divided by units under maintenance at the beginning of the year, adjusted for new units under maintenance at the end of that financial year). As of September 30, 2019, our units under maintenance were served by approximately 1,000 branches, of which 300 branches were in the Americas segment, 300 branches in the Europe/Africa segment and 400 branches were in the Asia/Pacific segment. We have also recently begun implementing shared service centers, designed to enhance efficiency by centralizing a number of administrative processes across regions. Our Services are provided based on service contracts with the customers. The service contracts set out the scope of the service package for the customers and range from basic packages, including inspection and testing, to full maintenance packages which may include services such as preventative maintenance, repair, parts repair and replacement, quality assurance, annual safety testing, after hours emergency service, quality assurance or release of passengers trapped in cabins. Pricing for our Services depends upon the type of contract. In a full service contract, the main costs are those of labor and components. In an oil & grease service contract, the main cost is labor. The majority of our service contracts have a term of one to five years but may also go up to ten years in some regions. Typically, we include the first one or two years of maintenance for a newly installed elevator or escalator in the New Installations price, depending on the region. MAX, our cloud-based digitally enhanced maintenance solution, is designed to increase service quality by reducing downtime by up to 50% through creating information transparency for the customer. As of March 31, 2020, more than 129,000 MAX units had been installed globally. We collaborated with Microsoft on MAX to develop an IoT based end-to-end solution to digitally transform service operations and create new customer solutions. MAX is supported by VIEW, our operational business steering tool which automatically dispatches qualified technicians to resolve the problems identified by MAX. 151 ----- MAX enables machine data from elevators and escalators to be collected globally in real-time using a proprietary IoT device. This and additional internal data is then transmitted to the cloud through highly secure channels and analyzed using VIEW to generate actionable insights for our technicians, improve reliability and availability of the elevator or escalator units and create transparency for our customers. This real-time diagnosis draws the technician’s attention to necessary action not only when shutdowns happen but even before the defect occurs. The cloud-based modular and extendable nature of the MAX platform sets us apart from our competitors’ offerings, which are extensions of traditional systems. We also use real-time troubleshooting with online diagnostic and customer service tools, as well as remote monitoring to service our approximately 1.4 million units under maintenance as of March 31, 2020. Changes in the legal and regulatory environment applicable to the products are a key factor that influences the services provided by our Service business.

We therefore offer comprehensive elevator and escalator modernization to enable our customers to comply with applicable legal requirements and to prolong their elevator and escalator system’s lifespan safely and cost efficiently. Our Modernization business addresses challenges relating to the customers’ need to comply with constantly evolving standards and regulations, age-related wear and tear, efficiency and capacity optimization. Modernization benefits may include lower operating costs, greater energy efficiency and increased tenant satisfaction, as well as an increase in the building’s value. Our partial Modernization solutions for elevators include safety and regulatory retrofits (e.g. fire control systems), the replacement of individual components to match existing ones (e.g., door drives and operating panels), a new look for the cabin and entrance, retrofits for increased comfort (e.g., door zone monitoring systems), more functionality (e.g. access control) and optimizing energy consumption (e.g., LED lighting that switches off when the cabin is standing still). We offer modernization solutions not only for elevator systems which we have manufactured and installed, but also for elevators manufactured and installed by third-party companies. Our solutions can be adapted to all existing installations, regardless of the component type and its manufacturer. We utilize widely used and tested technologies, plus flexibility in parts supplied for such modernization projects. We also offer a wide range of tailored replacement solutions for existing elevator systems (with or without a machine room). These solutions go beyond simple modernization upgrades to encompass the complete replacement of an existing elevator system. Our replacement solutions seek to make use of the existing shaft and avoid additional masonry, structural modification and painting. This not only limits costs, but also reduces the amount of dust and noise produced by the modernization process. Our replacement solutions range from very small lift systems to our high-end TWIN system, depending on the particular customer’s needs and the available infrastructure, which offers the potential to expand transport capacity within the same shaft footprint. In addition, we offer modernization solutions not only for elevators, but also for escalators, moving walks and airport solution systems.

We have 16 research and development centers spread across countries in the Americas, Europe/Africa and Asia/Pacific. We are the only supplier in the industry to have an offering similar to our TWIN elevator system, which combines two independent cars in one shaft. We are also currently in the process of developing the MULTI system, which would be the world’s first rope-free elevator. Our R&D work is focused on what we consider to be the fundamental technological challenges to better serve a growing, aging and rapidly urbanizing society. Central among these are the digital transformation of industry, climate change and energy transition. At the same time, customer demand for high quality applications, increased functionality, design flexibility and lower cost manufacturing processes are also driving our research and development efforts. We believe that taking a leading position in the development of sustainable products manufactured in a sustainable way will ultimately strengthen our position and help to distinguish us from our competitors. Throughout our research and development process, the core principle guiding innovation is product safety. To execute these plans, we manage the entire life cycle of our products beginning with the development of an idea and ending with the decision on whether to launch a product. Our research and development costs and capitalized development costs related to internally developed innovations amounted to €106 million in the 2018/2019 Financial Year.

Since these industries tend to be highly unionized, many of our employees are organized in country-specific union organizations. In Germany, as an example, many of the employees are organized in the German Industrial Union of Metalworkers (IG Metall). Several German companies of the Group are subject to various relevant industry-wide collective bargaining agreements (Flächentarifverträge) for the metal and electronics industry and/or apply collective bargaining agreements which have been concluded specifically for one or several Group companies. For example, in March 2020, thyssenkrupp Elevator concluded a collective bargaining agreement “Future Elevator” with German IG Metall in connection with the Acquisition. The “Future Elevator” collective bargaining agreement excludes forced redundancies (“Ausschluss betriebsbedingter Beendigungskündigungen”) and provides for site guarantees (“Standortsicherungszusagen”) for the German production and essential service sites and is valid until March 31, 2027. In many other countries in which we operate, we are bound by collective bargaining agreements with trade unions in France, Spain, the United States, Canada and Brazil as amended from time to time. In several countries including Germany, France, Spain, Belgium and Italy, employee representative bodies have been established. These employee representative bodies enjoy numerous information and consultation rights relating to personnel, social and economic matters, especially with regard to dismissals, compensation and benefits and in case of restructurings or redundancies. Collective agreements which are in place in various countries provide for additional protection and benefits (e.g. severance entitlements) of employees, as well as enhanced information and consultation rights of employee representatives in connection with lay-offs, restructurings, reorganizations and other corporate actions. In some countries, collective agreements have been entered into with local employee representative bodies covering a broad range of topics, in particular remuneration and working time. A minority of our employees enjoy some form of special protection against dismissal, not only due to explicit commitments in collective agreements, but also for other reasons, in particular statutory or contractual provisions regarding, among other things, maternity and sick leave or works council and/or union membership. Since 2016, we have from time to time experienced strikes at sites in France and Spain, though these have not caused material disruptions.

IP rights are currently centrally managed and coordinated by thyssenkrupp Intellectual Property Services GmbH based in Essen, Germany, which provides this service to us, with support and assistance from in-house IP professionals in key countries such as the United States and China. After the Acquisition Closing Date, we will be managing our intellectual property with our own in-house IP professionals and external counsel. As of March 31, 2020, we owned approximately 900 granted patents, 570 patent families, 550 registered trademarks and 160 trademark families and had applied for approximately 800 patents and 90 trademarks. We also owned approximately 117 designs and applied for registration of approximately 26 designs, as of March 31, 2020. While IP is an essential part of our business and IP assets are, in the aggregate, of material importance to our business, we believe that no single IP asset is material to our business as a whole. On September 25, 2019, thyssenkrupp Elevator Innovation entered into a licensing agreement with thyssenkrupp AG (the “Licensing Agreement”), allowing us to indefinitely use certain trademarks, including the trademark “thyssenkrupp” in carrying out the business of the Group against payment of a one- time fee.

Following these inspections, the European Commission opened an investigation into Otis, KONE, Schindler and the thyssenkrupp Group. According to the European Commission, between 1995 and 2004, cartel members rigged bids for procurement contracts, fixed prices and allocated projects to each other, shared markets and exchanged competitively sensitive information. The thyssenkrupp Group was fined a total of €479.7 million in February 2007 for its involvement in this cartel. The thyssenkrupp Group appealed the decision which resulted in a reduced fine of €319.8 million. This decision has become final and binding and the fine has been paid. Similar proceedings, including several raids on elevator and escalator manufacturers, were launched by the Austrian Federal Competition Authority, but thyssenkrupp Group applied for leniency under the applicable Austrian leniency program and received full immunity from fines in Austria. As a result of the European Commission’s decision of February 2007 and the investigation by the Austrian Federal Competition Authority, thyssenkrupp AG and some of its subsidiaries were subject to private follow-on litigation. Although final judgments have been issued or settlements have been entered into in the majority of the cases, we remain exposed to possible joint and several liabilities arising from ongoing claims up to the amount of €150 million in total in Belgium, the Netherlands and Austria. The Group has made appropriate provisioning for the sums we may be liable to pay, as well as the costs of the proceedings. We also have an indemnity under the Share Purchase Agreement of up to €29 million from these claims. 158 ----- _Civil cartel claims Belgium_ The European Commission is suing the Group jointly and severally with competitors for damages of €6.1 million plus interest for cartel overcharges of our products in the EU buildings in Belgium. The case was originally dismissed by the Brussels Commercial Court in 2014 and is currently pending at the court of appeals. We have made a provision of €2.6 million to cover the risk of this litigation, which is equivalent to 75% of the claimed amount relating to projects involving thyssenkrupp Elevator, plus potential interest as of September 30, 2019. _Civil cartel claims the Netherlands_ In 2011, a foundation, Stichting Elevator Cartel Claim (representing, among others, H&M, C&A and NH Hotels), brought action against us as well as our competitor KONE, for a declaration of liability, alleging cartelrelated damages following the European Commission’s decision of 2007 and claiming damages of €22.3 million plus interest. The case is currently pending before the District Court of Rotterdam. We have made a provision of €3.3 million to cover the risk of this litigation, which is equivalent to 50% of the claimed amount relating to projects involving thyssenkrupp Elevator, plus potential interest as of September 30, 2019. _Civil cartel claims Austria_ Eight lawsuits by public institutions or corporations and companies (including the City of Vienna, the City of Linz, the SPAR corporate group and various real estate companies) against the Group jointly and severally with the other participants of the cartel are currently pending. The total value of the claims is approximately €117.3 million plus interest, of which claims related to thyssenkrupp Elevator’s projects are approximately €14.7 million plus potential umbrella claims of €5.1 million. The claimants allege that the cartel in Austria led to cartel overcharges and umbrella damages in relation to sales by third-party competitors who did not participate in the cartel. Ultimately, we do not expect to be fully liable for the total amount based on the number of our products involved but rather for a fraction, if at all, of the value in dispute based on our products involved.

(“thyssenkrupp Elevator Korea”) on four different sites in South Korea in the years 2018 and 2019 have led to the initiation of criminal and administrative proceedings, inter alia, against thyssenkrupp Elevator Korea, mainly for indicted non- performance of certain safety measures as the owner of the business. Three of these proceedings are currently in initial criminal and administrative proceedings in lower courts, and a fourth has been appealed by the prosecution and by thyssenkrupp Elevator Korea. In March 2019, the Korean environment and labor committee (“ELC”) of the national assembly began to investigate these incidents. The ELC ordered (i) a two-week special investigation, which concluded on November 5, 2019 against the safety management at sites and the legality of certain related contracts and (ii) all relevant government ministries to audit the four major elevator companies in South Korea for any violations against certain statutory laws. On November 7, 2019, the ELC conducted an audit where thyssenkrupp Elevator Korea and the relevant government ministries were present for questioning. These ongoing administrative proceedings may eventually result in the imposition of administrative sanctions against thyssenkrupp Elevator Korea for violations of health and safety-related rules as well as construction industry and elevator regulations governing sub-contracting, specifically on the following grounds: 159 ----- (i) responsibility of thyssenkrupp Elevator Korea as a ‘business owner’ for the infringement of safety-related rules; and (ii) violation of the 50% rule on subcontracting under the Elevator Act, forbidding the outsourcing of more than 50% to third parties in connection with maintenance services. The potential sanctions for violation of the health and safety provisions range from a fine of €0.2 million to suspension of the New Installation business in South Korea for a period of three to eleven months. The potential sanctions for violation of the provisions of the Elevator Act range from monetary fine of €0.9 million to a suspension of the Service business in South Korea for at least two years. thyssenkrupp Elevator Korea, however believes that the relevant authority is considering limiting penalties for violation of the Elevator Act to fines only, since all major elevator companies are facing potential violations. In addition to these proceedings, thyssenkrupp Elevator Korea was also facing charges of violations of certain provisions of the Framework Act on Construction Industry, relating to rules on sub-contracting, for which it was recently fined €32,000. In the event that thyssenkrupp Elevator Korea becomes subject to further fines or business suspensions, it must be compliant with the restriction on subcontracting for a period five years following the imposition, in order to avoid the revocation of its construction business license.

It is closely interlinked with risk management and with our internal control system. 160 ----- Central components of the “Inform and Advise” pillar are antitrust law, anti-money laundering, export control and corruption prevention training programs carried out by the compliance officers as well as compliance advice given on business transactions and processes. In the training programs, employees are informed about compliance requirements, risks, and possible sanctions. The requirements are based on law and Group-wide policies and serve to implement international standards. We keep all our employees informed about compliance measures and new developments through training, intranet and various forms of communication adapted to target groups and content. We provide compliance support on important business transactions, for instance in connection with major projects, acquisitions or the engagement of intermediaries. Our compliance officers also advise the operating units on integrating compliance into their business processes. The “Identify” pillar focuses on regularly reviewing critical business operations based on a risk-oriented, structured audit process. Anti-money laundering screenings of high-risk payments are carried out when red flags are raised. An additional element is the identification of compliance risks through our whistleblowing system. Alongside the options of directly contacting a supervisor or the compliance department, this system provides employees with a further channel for reporting possible infringements of laws or policies without revealing their identity. The third pillar, “Report and Act,” encompasses intensive compliance reporting in all three dimensions of our organizational matrix. We investigate all reports of legal violations. Any violations identified are sanctioned as necessary, regardless of the name and function of the person involved. Substantive compliance responsibility in these areas remains with the competent corporate functions and segments. This ensures that in all areas of the company compliance is understood in accordance with our mission statement, an intensive exchange of knowledge takes place between the compliance function and those responsible for content, and the resultant synergies in organization, processes and methods are utilized.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655
291_2,Offering 2020.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.30,Compliance and Risk Management,18.30.2,Risk Management,"Our risk strategy is focused on securing our existence and increasing our sustainably. Our business success requires opportunities to be recognized and associated risks to be identified and evaluated. Our risk strategy dictates that business risks should be entered into consciously and responsibly and managed proactively by all employees. Risks threatening our ability to continue as a going concern are to be avoided. The Group bases our risk management approach on the “Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) Policy” (the “GRC Policy”) applicable for all consolidated companies of the Group. In this policy, we define basic principles for corporate governance and risk management and also describe the universally applicable risk policy principles in the Group as a framework for meeting the requirements of proper, consistent and proactive risk management. The principles serve as guidelines for professional and responsible risk management. The aims of risk management at the Group are to increase risk awareness and establish a value-based risk culture at all corporate levels. Risks and opportunities in the Group are therefore analyzed transparently and are systematically incorporated into business decisions. In the GRC Policy, the risk management system methodology is embedded in a “three lines of defense” model. The first line of defense consists of functions that own and manage risks via management controls and internal controls. The second line of defense consists of functions such as Controlling, Accounting and Risk, Compliance and Legal, which oversee risks and help proactively manage them. Additionally, we have a department for our Internal Control System (“ICS”) responsible for setting ICS strategy and ICS processes at our subsidiaries. The goal of the ICS is to reduce operational risks, to ensure the reliability of financial reporting and to comply with laws, policies and internal guidelines. Depending on a company’s size, a control testing or a control selfassessment is annually performed to ensure that controls are implemented and designed to mitigate the underlying risks. Identified control deficiencies are assessed with regards to their impact and action plans defined. The third line of defense consists of Corporate Function Internal Audit, which independently reviews the appropriateness and efficiency of the process and systems implemented by the first two lines of defense. The “three lines of defense” model is also supplemented by the work of our external financial statement auditors. The design of various risk management instruments ensures that the sub-processes are integrated in a continuous risk management loop and all risk managers are involved appropriately in the risk management process. Methods and tools to identify, assess, control and report risks are implemented throughout the Group and are continually improved. Our main focus in using risk management instruments is to assess possible deviations in the key performance indicators such as adjusted EBIT and cash flow. Standard reporting of estimated opportunities and risks occurs at monthly intervals and once yearly for budget purposes. The opportunities and risks not included in the monthly updated estimations or in the budget are part of standard business unit reporting. 161 ----- To record relevant event risks in a structured way in specific areas of responsibility, all Group companies worldwide use a standardized IT risk management application to prepare risk maps biannually. The assessment period used for the risk map goes beyond the period covered by the forecast and provides multiple-year transparency on the local risk assessments. The regular reporting and updating of risks at local level also ensures that risk awareness remains high throughout the Group. Risks already recognized in the form of balance sheet provisions are also the subject of standardized analyses and risk reporting, ensuring systematic control of these risks as well. Ad hoc risks are communicated immediately to the risk management officers and are also documented via the established reporting channels. Risks are also further evaluated by the Risk and Internal Control Committee on a regular basis. These standardized risk management processes ensure that the Management Board and Supervisory Board are informed promptly and in a structured way about our current risk situation. However, despite comprehensive risk analysis, the occurrence of risks cannot be systematically ruled out. Risk transfer to insurers is currently handled centrally by the insurance department of the thyssenkrupp Group and will be taken over by us on the Acquisition Closing Date.

The Sustainability Committee has set targets in the areas of technology and innovations, environment, climate, energy, purchasing, and people. Our targets include energy and environmental management, annual energy efficiency gains, sustainable adjusted research and development intensity, a share of women in leadership positions, accident frequency rate and supplier sustainability audits. Progress towards these targets is factored into variable compensation for our Management Board and business area boards via a sustainability multiplier. For more information on our management, see “Management.” We aim to have our suppliers, along the entire chain, act responsibly and in line with environmental and social standards based on principles of sustainability. To be able to work with us, suppliers must sign our “Supplier Code of Conduct” or comply with equivalent standards. The Supplier Code of Conduct addresses possible risks and negative impacts along the supply chain, including areas such as human rights, fair working conditions, environmental protection, combating corruption and transparency into the origin of conflict minerals. Based on standard risk criteria for specific countries and sectors, the business areas select certain suppliers each year in order to carry out sustainability audits and evaluate compliance with our sustainability principles.

In particular, such laws include laws governing the design, manufacture, installation, operation and product safety of our products and services, and are mainly outlined in applicable building laws, building codes, specific safety codes for elevators and escalators and other product safety laws, as well as laws governing airport ground equipment and airport buildings. These laws differ substantially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In addition, our business is subject to environmental laws, product warranty and product liability laws, employee health and safety laws, labor and employment protection laws, intellectual property laws, hazardous substances and chemicals laws, export control laws, public procurement laws, competition and antitrust laws, tax laws, anti-money laundering laws, sanction laws, anti-bribery laws, anti- terrorism laws, data protection laws and criminal and other laws. In the area of environmental regulation, our operations are required to comply with laws and regulations relating to air, water and noise pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, toxic and other chemicals and materials, waste treatment and disposal methods, and the energy efficiency of production processes, among other things, in various jurisdictions in which we operate. We are also subject to periodic monitoring by environmental protection authorities in various jurisdictions. For example, at the EU level the legal and regulatory environment in which we operate includes many EU directives and regulations, which are either applied directly or otherwise implemented in the individual EU member states through national legislation. By contrast, in the United States numerous federal laws apply at the national level, while individual states and other more local jurisdictions have their own laws (e.g. building codes). In addition, international agreements, including bilateral and multilateral agreements between countries concerning customs duties or other regulations related to the import and export of products, apply directly or indirectly to us. The legal and regulatory requirements applicable to us are broad and diverse and may impose conflicting obligations and limitations on us. The cost of compliance with legal and regulatory requirements may be significant and we undertake significant efforts to stay up-to-date with all relevant requirements. The most material laws and regulations applicable to our business operations, broken down by our key jurisdictions (the EU, the United States and China, based on revenue as well as production output during the financial years 2016/2017 to 2018/2019), and by the general category of regulation, are described in further detail below. References in this section to any legislation or regulation are deemed to refer to such legislation or regulation as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, and all further rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless such context requires otherwise.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655
291_2,Offering 2020.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.36,Laws governing our products and services,18.36.1,EU and Germany,"_Product Safety Directive_ Directive 2001/95/EC of the EU Parliament and of the Council of December 3, 2001 (last amended by Regulation (EC) No 596/2009 of the EU Parliament and of the Council of June 18, 2009) on general product safety (the “Product Safety Directive”) applies to any product – including in the context of providing a service – which is intended for consumers or likely, under reasonably foreseeable conditions, to be used by consumers even if not intended for them, in the absence of specific provisions among the EU regulations governing the safety of products concerned, or if sectorial legislation is insufficient. Under the Product Safety Directive, producers and distributors must place on the market only products which comply with general safety requirements. Therefore, manufacturers must provide consumers with the necessary information in order to assess a product’s inherent threat, particularly when this is not inherently obvious, and take the necessary measures to avoid such threats (for example, withdraw products from the market, inform consumers, recall products which have already been supplied to consumers). Appointed national authorities must monitor the compliance of products available on the market, ensure product safety legislation and rules are applied by manufacturers and business chains and apply sanctions when necessary. For example, Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of July 9, 2008 sets out the requirements for 164 ----- accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products, and its most prominent feature is the “CE Marking” which can be used to attest the conformity of a product with the applicable requirements of the relevant legislation. In addition, the Product Safety Directive introduces an EU rapid alert system for dangerous non-food products. Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2019/417 sets out guidelines for the management of the EU Rapid Information System (“RAPEX”), an information system for the rapid exchange of information between the EU member states and the EU Commission on measures and action taken in relation to products posing a serious risk to the health and safety of consumers. In addition to RAPEX, the Commission has set up the “Product Safety Business Alert Gateway,” enabling producers and distributors to report their dangerous products to the relevant Member State authorities. _Lifts Directive_ In light of the requirements for certain products and equipment, further directives have been adopted to harmonize national legislation regarding health and safety requirements across the EU. Of particular importance to us in this context is Directive 2014/33/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of February 26, 2014 (the “Lifts Directive”), regarding the harmonization of the laws of the Member States relating to lifts and safety components for lifts (as defined in Annex III of the Lifts Directive). This Lifts Directive on the sale and putting into service of lifts and safety components for lifts has two key objectives: (i) to allow lifts and their safety components to be sold throughout the EU market; and (ii) to ensure a high level of safety for lift users and maintenance staff. It generally applies to all lifts permanently serving buildings and constructions, intended for the transport of persons and goods, and operating at a speed of more than 0.15 m/s. The Lifts Directive lays down uniform rules on the sale and putting into service of lifts and safety components for lifts and defines the responsibilities of manufacturers, importers, distributors, installers and authorized representatives in the context of the sale of lifts and safety components for lifts. All lifts and safety components for sale in the EU must bear the CE Marking (as described above) to demonstrate that they meet all essential safety requirements of EU legislation. Before obtaining the CE Marking, the manufacturer must conduct a safety and conformity assessment and establish technical documentation for its lifts and components. Lifts and safety components for lifts which conform with harmonized standards or parts thereof, the references of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union, shall be presumed to conform to the essential health and safety requirements set out in Annex I of the Lifts Directive covered by those standards or parts thereof. “Harmonized standard,” as defined in Article 2 No 1 lit. c of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of October 25, 2012 on European standardization, means technical specifications, adopted by a recognized standardization body, for repeated or continuous application, with which compliance is not compulsory, and which is one of the following: (i) an “international standard” meaning a standard adopted by an international standardization body; (ii) a “European standard” meaning a standard adopted by a European standardization organization; (iii) a “harmonized standard” meaning a European standard adopted on the basis of a request made by the Commission for the application of Union harmonization legislation; and (iv) a “national standard” meaning a standard adopted by a national standardization body. Of particular importance here are the EN 81-20 and EN 81-50 safety rules for the construction and installation of lifts and EN 13015 specifying how maintenance must be organized to keep lift safety up to the level required by the Lifts Directive. _Machinery Directive_ The Lifts Directive does not apply to funicular railways, hoists, escalators, moving walks and low-speed (< 0.15 m/s) home elevators. These are covered under Directive 2006/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 17, 2006 on machinery and amending Directive 95/16/EC (recast) (the “Machinery Directive”). The Machinery Directive outlines both compulsory as well as voluntary standards, and only applies to products when they are first placed on the EU market. This directive covers machinery, interchangeable equipment, safety components, lifting accessories, chains, ropes and webbing, removable mechanical transmission devices and partly completed machinery. This directive does not cover other types of machinery, such as machinery used in fairgrounds, the nuclear industry, laboratories and mines or by the military or police. _Product Liability Directive_ Council Directive 85/374/EEC of July 25, 1985, as amended by Directive 1999/34/EC of the EU Parliament and of the Council of May 10, 1999 (the “Product Liability Directive”), applies to movables which have been industrially produced, whether or not the movables have been subsequently incorporated into another movable or into an immovable. It establishes the principle of strict liability in cases of damage deemed to be caused by a defective product. Under a strict liability regime, the producer may be liable even without negligence or fault on 165 ----- its part. “Producer” means the manufacturer of a finished product, the producer of any raw material or the manufacturer of a component part and any person who, by putting his or her name, trademark or other distinguishing feature on the product, presents himself as its producer. Producers can be cleared of liability under certain conditions, notably, if they prove that they did not put the product into circulation, the defect was due to the compliance of the product with mandatory regulations issued by public authorities or the state of scientific or technical knowledge at the time that the product was put into circulation could not detect the defect. The Product Liability Directive applies to damage causing death or personal injuries and damage to private property. It sets out a time limit of three years for the recovery of damages and forbids clauses limiting or excluding the liability of the producer. The Product Liability Directive does not restrict compensation for non-material damage under national legislation. Within the chain of producers, we are theoretically entitled to seek compensation from our suppliers if the defect giving rise to product liability stems from a component supplied by such supplier. However, clear responsibility can be difficult to prove and, in order to maintain good relations to our suppliers, we are often required to refrain from holding our suppliers accountable. _Electromagnetic Compatibility Directive_ Directive 2014/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of February 26, 2014 on electromagnetic compatibility (the “Electromagnetic Compatibility Directive”) aims to ensure that electrical and electronic equipment complies with an adequate level of electromagnetic compatibility. It outlines uniform rules to ensure protection against electromagnetic disturbance in order to guarantee the free movement of electrical and electronic equipment within the EU’s internal market. The equipment covered by the Electromagnetic Compatibility Directive includes both apparatus and fixed installations. It does not apply to: radio and telecommunications terminal equipment; aircraft or equipment intended to be installed in aircraft; custom-built evaluation kits for professional use at research and development facilities; and radio equipment used by radio amateurs, unless the equipment is made available on the market for the general public. _Regulation on Market Surveillance and Product Compliance_ On June 20, 2019, Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 on market surveillance and compliance of products (Market Surveillance Regulation) was adopted by the European legislators. The Market Surveillance Regulation will apply from 16 July 2021, and will lead to a tightening of conformity checks and additional powers for national market surveillance authorities. The EU’s stated objective is to reinforce trust in the EU single market by ensuring compliance with, and enforcement of product legislation in cooperation with customs authorities. The powers of national market surveillance authorities will include at least (ii) the power to require economic operators to provide relevant document (including access to embedded software, information on their supply chain), (ii) the power to enter any premises, and (iii) the power to take samples. The measures implemented by the Market Surveillance Regulation will particularly have impact on online sales; however, also the elevator industry is also affected because elevators are also subject to harmonized EU legislation (i.e., Lifts Directive) and are therefore covered by the Market Surveillance Regulation. _Public Procurement Directive_ Since we regularly sell our products to public entities in the course of large infrastructure projects, we are also subject to public procurement laws. Directive 2014/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of February 26, 2014 on public procurement and repealing Directive 2004/18/EC (the “Public Procurement Directive”) regulates how public contracts above certain threshold amounts can be awarded by or on behalf of EU member states’ authorities. Within the meaning of the Public Procurement Directive, procurement is the acquisition by means of a public contract of works, supplies or services by one or more contracting authorities from economic operators chosen by those contracting authorities, whether or not the works, supplies or services are intended for a public purpose. Procurement processes which are subject to the Public Procurement Directive must comply with the requirements for a specific set of procedures as set out in the Public Procurement Directive. _German implementation measures and other material legislation_ In Germany, the Product Safety Directive has been implemented through the Product Safety Act (Produktsicherheitsgesetz). Section 8 of the Product Safety Act provides for the possibility of issuing ordinances. In this context, the Lifts Directive was implemented in the 12th ordinance to the Product Safety Act (12. VO zum _Produktsicherheitsgesetz – Aufzugsverordnung, the “Elevator Ordinance”) and the Machinery Directive in the_ 166 ----- ninth ordinance to the Product Safety Act (9. VO zum Produktsicherheitsgesetz, Maschinenverordnung, the “Machine Ordinance”). Both are essentially aligned to the provisions of the corresponding directives. Section 5 para. 5 of the Elevator Ordinance obliges the installer of an elevator to take “corrective measures” (Korrekturmaßnahmen), which can be interpreted as more than the warnings which may be sufficient in typical product safety cases, therefore requiring the installer to provide a fully functional product even after the expiration of any relevant warranty period, which could in turn result in significant costs for us. In addition to European standards, technical standards such as DIN 15306 on passenger lifts in residential buildings and DIN 15309 on passenger lifts in non-residential buildings continue to exist in Germany. The Product Liability Directive has been implemented through the Product Liability Act (Produkthaftungsgesetz). Furthermore, the German Civil Code (Bürgerliches _Gesetzbuch) obliges the manufacturer of a product to observe and put in place adequate safety precautions. Thereby, defective products shall be prevented from causing personal injury or damage. In particular, the manufacturer must avoid faults relating to the design and/or manufacture of the product. Furthermore, the manufacturer must instruct the users on the intended use of the product. For products that are already on the market, the manufacturer must monitor how its products are used and must inform the users about potential harmful uses which were not originally anticipated. According to the legal definition, “manufacturer” is anyone who produces a product, including suppliers and sub-suppliers. If the manufacturer fails to comply with its obligations, it shall be liable for the damage incurred. While potential claimants must prove that a product is defective and that this defect caused personal injury or damage, the manufacturer is obliged to evidentially prove that it has fulfilled its duties relating to design, manufacture and monitoring of the products as well as regarding adequately informing the users. The Electromagnetic Compatibility Directive is implemented in Germany via the law on electromagnetic compatibility of equipment (Gesetz über die elektromagnetische Verträglichkeit von Betriebsmitteln). In addition, there are regulations on lifts within the German building law (Bauordnungsrecht), specifically with respect to fire protection regulations. The Public Procurement Directive is implemented in Germany through several legal acts, in particular, Part IV of the Act against Restraints of Competition (Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbesbeschränkungen), the Public Procurement Ordinance (Vergabeverordnung), and the Regulations on Contract Awards for Public Works (Vergabe- und _Vertragsordnung für Bauleistungen – Teil A, “VOB/A”) which also covers public procurement processes that are_ outside the scope of the Public Procurement Directive.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

Within the IBC and its local adaptations, there are also varying provisions governing how our products may be used as part of a building. _Safety standards from ASME and ANSI_ The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (“ASME”) and the American National Standards Institute (“ANSI”) are both involved in setting the standards pertaining to how our products may be built and integrated into an existing structure. The ASME 17.1 elevator and escalator safety code covers the design, construction, operation, inspection, testing, maintenance, alteration, and repair of hoisting and lowering mechanisms (equipped with a car or platform) when that hoisting mechanism is located in or adjacent to a structure. This includes (among others): elevators, power-driven stairways and moving walks, escalators and moving walks, hoisting and lowering mechanisms, dumbwaiters and cargo lifts. It does not, however, cover personnel hoists, which are instead covered by ANSI A10.4. Similarly, material hoists are covered by ANSI A10.5 and stairway chairlifts are covered by ASME A18.1. _Maintenance standards from ASME and OSHA_ In California, the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (“OSHA”) and ASME work in conjunction to upkeep maintenance requirements for elevators. In general, state governments monitor elevator certification and inspections. Periodic maintenance is required on elevators, and certain maintenance, as well as records must be maintained in order to be certified by the relevant state and local government authorities. ASME, as well as 167 ----- OSHA, requires that all operating components which can be hazardous to individuals must be inspected and repaired immediately if problems are found. The safety equipment includes door operation, floor-to-floor travel, acceleration and deceleration of the elevator and emergency and safety equipment. _Product liability in the United States_ Under US product liability law, manufacturers, distributors, suppliers, retailers, and other parties who make products available to the public can be held responsible for the injuries deemed to be caused by those products. If a consumer, user or bystander is injured by a product that is defective or unreasonably dangerous, the manufacturer or anyone else in the supply chain can be held responsible for that injury. Product liability lawsuits brought by individual consumers or groups of consumers can become costly and lengthy. No uniform product liability statute or common law exists in the United States. Each state defines product liability law under its own standards. However, product liability claims are generally brought under the scope of strict product, tort (negligence or fraud) and warranty claims. The diversity of product liability law in the United States and the general availability of punitive damages, class actions and contingency fees create fertile ground for product liability claims in the United States.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

Construction projects that require a formal bid invitation are: (i) large infrastructure and public utility projects that concern public interests and security; (ii) projects invested in wholly or partly by state-owned funds or financed by the state; and (iii) projects using loans or aid funds from international organizations or governments of other countries. Tenders for the above types of elevator projects are also subject to this law. _Law of the People’s Republic of China on Product quality_ Anyone who manufactures or sells any product within the territory of the People’s Republic of China shall comply with the Law of the People’s Republic of China on Product Quality. For the purpose of this regulation, products are defined as products processed or manufactured for sale. Although the law does not apply to construction projects, construction materials, structural components and fittings, and equipment that are used for construction projects are within the scope of the legislation, therefore also covering our products. _Special equipment safety law of the People’s Republic of China_ The Special Equipment Safety Law of the People’s Republic of China applies to elevators as they fall under the law’s definition of special equipment. The law applies to the production (including the design, manufacture, installation, modification and maintenance), operation, use, inspection, testing of and the supervision and administration of elevators. Elevator recalls are also governed by this law. 168 ----- _Product liability in the People’s Republic of China_ Pursuant to the Product Quality Law of the People’s Republic of China (as promulgated on February 22, 1993, implemented on September 1, 1993 and amended in 2000 and 2009), the Law of the People’s Republic of China on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Consumers (as promulgated on October 31, 1993 and amended on October 25, 2013) and the Tort Law of the People’s Republic of China (as promulgated on December 26, 2009 and implemented on July 1, 2010), a producer shall be responsible for the quality of the products it has produced. Where any harm is caused by a defective product, the victim may claim for compensation either from the producers or sellers.

In selecting the work equipment, employers must pay attention to the specific working conditions which exist in the workplace with a view towards the safety and health of workers. Where risks cannot be fully eliminated in the operation of the work equipment, employers must take appropriate measures to minimize them. Where EU legislation governing work equipment exists, employers must ensure that the equipment meets its requirements or, if no such requirements exist, then the equipment must meet the requirements outlined in Annex I of the Minimum Safety and Health Requirements Directive. Where work equipment is likely to involve a specific risk to worker health and safety, employers must ensure that access to it is restricted only to those tasked with using that equipment. Employers must also ensure that only specially qualified workers carry out repair, modification, maintenance or servicing work. Employers must ensure that workers are appropriately trained, especially with regard to specific-risk equipment, and are made aware of any risks which the use of equipment may entail. In Germany, the “Ordinance on Industrial Safety and Health (Betriebssicherheitsverordnung)” implements the Minimum Safety and Health Requirements Directive and is further refined by the “Technical rules for operational safety” (Technische Regeln für Betriebssicherheit – TRBS).

Its primary goal is to ensure that employers provide employees with an environment free from recognized hazards, such as exposure to toxic chemicals, excessive noise levels, mechanical dangers, heat or cold stress, or unsanitary conditions. OSHA creates rules which are, together with all other rules created by federal regulatory agencies, collected into a multi-part document called the Code of Federal Regulations (“CFR”). Individual states also have established their own occupational health and safety standards, and these are in some cases more stringent than those promulgated by OSHA. Under the “General Duty Clause” found at Section 5(a)(1) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are required to provide their employees with a place of employment that is “free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm.” In addition, most relevant for us are the following standards:",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

Imports are governed by a number of laws, including the Tariff Act of 1930. The US Departments of Justice, Commerce, State and Treasury and other federal agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals for violations of economic sanctions laws, export controls laws, anti-money laundering laws and other federal statutes and regulations, including those established by the US Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). Various government agencies may seek to impose modifications to business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned persons or entities as well as modifications to compliance programs, which may increase compliance costs, and may subject us to fines, penalties and other sanctions. A violation of these laws or regulations could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our current business in Russia and our former business in Iran, which still involves servicing and warranty claims, are subject to the regulatory framework of US secondary sanctions. The United States have imposed primary sanctions on certain Russian individuals, companies and sectors of the Russian economy. As a result of the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act of 2017, non-US persons must comply with certain secondary sanctions against Russia, even if such activities have no connection to the US. Among other things, non-US persons may face penalties for knowingly facilitating significant transactions or significant financial transactions for or on behalf of a party subject to the United States’ sanctions against Russia. Moreover, on November 5, 2018, the US announced it would withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action which had previously eased US sanctions on Iran under the authority of, among others, the Iran Sanctions 171 ----- Act, the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability and Divestment Act of 2010, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, the Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act of 2012, and various Executive Orders. In broad terms, the US has reimposed US extraterritorial sanctions measures against Iran in connection with activity related to Iran’s energy, petrochemical, automotive, shipping, shipbuilding, port operating, and financial sectors. Persons engaged in such activities involving Iran will face exposure to secondary sanctions or enforcement actions under US law. Additionally, the US government has included certain Iranian persons and entities on the Specially Designated Nationals And Blocked Persons List (“SDN List”) and other sanctions lists as administered by OFAC.

Of particular relevance are: provisions on merger control, the prohibition of anti-competitive agreements, collusive behavior, the prohibition of abuse of a dominant position and the receipt of advantages in violation of state aid rules within the market. In general, such competition and antitrust laws and regulations are designed to preserve free and open competition in the marketplace in an effort to enhance competitiveness and economic efficiency. National and supranational competition and antitrust authorities may initiate investigations and proceedings for alleged infringements of competition or antitrust laws, which may result in significant fines or other forms of liability or impose certain limitations or conditions regarding acquisitions and certain business practices.

For more information, see “Business—Legal Proceedings—Antitrust proceedings and private _follow-on litigation.”_ 170 ----- Within the EU, compliance with applicable European and national competition laws is monitored by the European Commission and in some cases the national competition authorities (for instance, in Germany, the Federal Cartel Office (Bundeskartellamt)). The EU’s antitrust rules are set out in articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (“TFEU”). Article 101(1) of the TFEU prohibits anticompetitive agreements to the extent they are not otherwise exempted by article 101(3) of the TFEU. The assessment of whether the exemption criteria of article 101(3) of the TFEU are met must be made by us in a “self-assessment.” This self-assessment of compliance of our agreements with dealers, suppliers or competitors generally carries the risk that the European Commission, national competition authorities or national courts could arrive at a different conclusion as to whether there is an infringement of the relevant competition law at issue.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

The terms under which such services are to be provided and the respective fees for such services are set out in the relevant Existing TSAs and are effective as of January 1, 2020. Pursuant to the Existing TSAs, the services shall continue to be provided essentially in the same manner, kind and scope as prior to January 1, 2020. The Existing TSAs have indefinite terms but are intended to last for a maximum duration of two years from their effective dates, whereupon the services covered by such Existing TSAs will be transitioned to, and thereafter will be provided directly by, the Group. The parties to the respective Existing TSAs may terminate the agreement in whole or in part following a notice period of six months which may be given at the end of each calendar month; however, such termination notice shall not be delivered within six months after the completion of the Offering. In accordance with the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, the thyssenkrupp Group and the Group are negotiating, at arm’s length, necessary amendments to the Existing TSAs to reflect the requirements of the Acquisition, including scope of services, changes to service charge levels, duration, and liability, as well as including additional required services or removing certain services. As per the Share Purchase Agreement, this negotiation process will result in each of the Existing TSAs being amended and restated on the Acquisition Closing Date (the “New TSAs”). Under the New TSAs, the thyssenkrupp Group will continue to provide a number of services, including relating to accounting and risk services, IT, procurement, real estate, human resources, compliance, tax (in certain jurisdictions) and others, to the Group, following the Acquisition. The New TSAs will supersede the Existing TSAs and will include this reduced selection of services to reflect the build-up of internal resource in the Group by the Acquisition Closing Date. The duration of each New TSA after the Acquisition Closing Date varies based on the scope and necessary support for each service. In addition to the Existing TSAs, certain companies of our Group have entered into over 500 different agreements with companies in the thyssenkrupp Group pursuant to which we receive a number of additional services and/or provide services to the thyssenkrupp Group (the “Additional Service Agreements”). The majority of these services are IT services and services of thyssenkrupp AG’s global shared services centers (GSS). Although a process is underway to terminate a significant number of the Additional Service Agreements prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, many of the Additional Service Agreements are expected to continue after the Acquisition Closing Date. In relation to those Additional Service Agreements which will not terminate prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, the thyssenkrupp Group and the Group are negotiating, at arm’s length, the extension of the minimum duration of various critical services provided by the thyssenkrupp Group under the Additional Service Agreements to allow a sufficient period to migrate those critical services away from the thyssenkrupp Group. 177 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

In addition to these contractual services, additional costs mainly related to general overhead functions such as accounting and risk, IT, procurement, intellectual property, real estate, human resources, legal and compliance, tax and other functions of the thyssenkrupp Group have been allocated based on certain allocation metrics such as revenue contribution of the Group in relation to the thyssenkrupp Group for the past. These corporate cost allocations amounted to €98 million, €71 million and €66 million in the years ended September 30, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. It is intended that, with effect from the Acquisition Closing Date, the New TSAs will replace some of these agreements and general services, whereas the existing contractual services will continue until the services covered by them can be transitioned to the Group or to other third party service providers. _License Agreement_ On September 25, 2019, against the background of a then-proposed initial public offering, thyssenkrupp Elevator Innovation entered into a brand licensing agreement with thyssenkrupp AG (the “Brand Licensing Agreement”), allowing thyssenkrupp Elevator Innovation and its subsidiaries to indefinitely use certain trademarks, including the trademark “thyssenkrupp” in carrying out the business of the Group, against payment of a one-time fee of €1,080 million.

Interest on the Euro Fixed Rate Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the date of original issuance. Interest on overdue principal and interest on the Euro Fixed Rate Notes will accrue at a rate that is 1% higher than the interest rate on the overdue principal or interest.

The Company will pay interest to the Holders of record on the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable interest payment date. The Euro FRN Notes will bear interest from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid. The Calculation Agent will, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m., London time, on each Determination Date, determine the Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable on the Euro FRN Notes in respect of the following Interest Period (the “Interest Amount”). The Interest Amount will be calculated by applying the Applicable Rate to the principal amount of the Euro FRN Notes outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period, multiplying each such amount by the actual number of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 365; provided that interest shall only be paid in respect of Euro FRN Notes outstanding on the applicable interest payment dates.

If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Company will request each of three major banks in London, as selected by the Company, to provide such bank’s rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Determination Date, for loans in a Representative Amount in euros to leading European banks for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such rates are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than two such rates are so provided then the rate for the Interest Period will be the rate in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period. “Eurozone” means the region comprised of member states of the European Union that adopt the euro. “Interest Period” means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and ending on but excluding the next succeeding interest payment date, with the exception that the first Interest Period shall commence on and include the Issue Date and end on and exclude, 2020. “Representative Amount” means the greater of (a) €1.0 million and (b) an amount that is representative for a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time. “Reuters Page EURIBOR1” means the display page so designated by Reuters (or such other page as may replace that page on that service or such other service as may be nominated as the information vendor). “TARGET Settlement Day” means any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET2) System is open for the settlement of payments in euro. _Dollar Fixed Rate Notes_ Interest on the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum and will be payable, in cash, semi-annually in arrears on and of each year, commencing on, 2021, to Holders of record on and preceding the applicable interest payment date.

Interest on overdue principal and interest on the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes will accrue at a rate that is 1% higher than the interest rate on the overdue principal or interest. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. Each interest period will end on (but not include) the relevant interest payment date. If the Company delivers global notes to the Trustee for cancellation on a date that is on or after the record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date will be paid on the redemption date to the Holder in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Company. Any Notes represented by global notes held by a nominee of DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream will be subject to the then applicable procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable. Euroclear’s and Clearstream’s current practice is to make payments in respect of global notes to participants of record that hold an interest in the relevant global notes on the business day immediately preceding the applicable interest payment date. 220 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

Substantially concurrently with the closing of the offering of the Notes on the Issue Date, the Issuers will enter into an escrow agreement (as amended, supplemented or modified from time to time, the “Escrow Agreement”) among the Issuers, the Trustee, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch as euro escrow agent (in such capacity, together with its successors, the “Euro Escrow Agent”) and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch as dollar escrow agent (in such capacity, together with its successors, the “Dollar Escrow Agent”), pursuant to which the Issuers will deposit, or cause to be deposited on their behalf, an amount in cash equal to (x) the gross proceeds of the Euro Fixed Rate Notes sold on the Issue Date into one escrow account (the “Euro Fixed Escrow Account”), (y) the gross proceeds of the Euro FRN Notes sold on the Issue Date into another escrow account (the “Euro FRN Escrow Account”) and (z) the gross proceeds of the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes sold on the Issue Date into a third escrow account (the “Dollar Fixed Escrow Account” and, together with the Euro Fixed Escrow Account and the Euro FRN Escrow Account, the “Escrow Accounts”). The Escrow Accounts established will each be segregated from the Issuers’ other funds. The Escrow Accounts will be controlled by the Euro Escrow Agent, in the case of the Euro Fixed Escrow Account and the Euro FRN Escrow Account, and the Dollar Escrow Agent, in the case of the Dollar Fixed Escrow Account, in each case subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders of the applicable series of Notes. The initial funds deposited in the Escrow Accounts, and all other funds, securities, interest, dividends, distributions and other property and payments credited to the Escrow Accounts in connection with the Notes (less any property and/or funds paid in accordance with the Escrow Agreement such as ordinary course charges and fees paid to the bank holding the Escrow Accounts) are referred to, collectively, as the “Escrowed Property.” Interest will be calculated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Notes. To secure the payment of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price (as defined below) of the Euro Fixed Rate Notes, the Euro FRN Notes and the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes, as applicable, the Issuers will grant the Trustee, for its benefit and the benefit of the Holders of the applicable series of Notes, subject to certain liens of the Escrow Agent, a first-priority security interest in the Euro Fixed Escrow Account, the Euro FRN Escrow Account and the Dollar Fixed Escrow Account, as applicable, and the Issuers’ rights under the Escrow Agreement, pursuant to one or more escrow account charges dated the Issue Date between the Issuers, the Trustee and the Escrow Agent (the “Escrow Charges”); provided, however that such liens and security interest shall automatically be released and terminate upon receipt by the Trustee of either an Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate (as defined below) or a notice of Special Mandatory Redemption (as defined below). The Escrow Charges will provide that the funds will be segregated and held for the purposes specified herein. By its acceptance of the Notes, each Holder shall be deemed to authorize and direct the Trustee to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent will invest the Escrowed Property as directed by the Issuers in such short-term liquid investments (including bank deposit products) as permitted under the Escrow Agreement, and liquidate such investments, as the Issuers will from time to time direct in writing. The Escrow Agreement shall provide for the Escrow Agent to release from each Escrow Account, upon instruction of the Company or the applicable Issuer, a portion of the Escrowed Property in an amount equal to the amount of accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from, and including, the Issue Date or the 223 ----- most recent interest payment date, as applicable, to, but excluding, any interest payment date prior to the Escrow Release in order to satisfy the interest payment obligations in respect of the Euro Fixed Rate Notes, the Euro FRN Notes or the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes, as applicable, under the Indenture as set forth under “—Principal, Maturity and Interest.” In addition, the Escrow Agent will be entitled pursuant to the Escrow Agreement to deduct amounts from the Escrowed Property in respect of negative interest having accrued on the Escrowed Property. Other than in connection with the payment of interest and Additional Amounts, if any, as set forth in the previous paragraph, the Company and the applicable Issuer will be entitled to cause the Escrow Agent to release Escrowed Property (in which case the Escrowed Property will be paid to, or as directed by, the Company or such Issuer) (the “Escrow Release”) (the date of the Escrow Release being referred to as the “Escrow Release Date”) upon delivery to the Escrow Agent, on or prior to December 31, 2020 (the “Escrow Longstop Date”), of an Officer’s Certificate (the “Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate”), upon which the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely absolutely without further investigation, certifying that the following conditions (collectively, the “Escrow _Conditions”) will be met substantially concurrently with or promptly following the Release on the Escrow_ Release Date: (1) the funds required to pay the consideration for the Acquisition will be required promptly (and in any event within two Business Days) following the release of the Escrowed Property to consummate the Acquisition substantially on the terms set forth under “Summary—The Transactions”; and (2) the conditions precedent to borrowing under the Senior Facilities (other than any condition precedent relating to the Release or satisfaction of the Escrow Conditions) shall have been, or substantially concurrently shall be, satisfied or waived in all material respects. Upon the Escrow Release, the Escrowed Property will be paid out of the Escrow Accounts in accordance with the Escrow Agreement for the purposes described under “Use of Proceeds” and the Escrow Accounts will be reduced to zero. In the event that (i) the Escrow Longstop Date occurs and the Escrow Agent shall not have received the Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate on or prior to such date or (ii) the Company informs the Escrow Agent and the Trustee in writing that, in the good faith judgment of the Company, the Acquisition will not be consummated on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, (the date of any such event being the “Special Termination Date”), the Issuers will redeem the entire outstanding aggregate principal amount of each series of the Notes (the “Special _Mandatory Redemption”) at a price (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Price”) equal to 100% of the issue_ price of such series of Notes as stated on the cover page of this offering memorandum, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes and Additional Amounts, if any, from, and including, the Issue Date to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below), subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. Notice of the Special Mandatory Redemption will be delivered by the Company no later than one Business Day following the Special Termination Date, to the Trustee, the Escrow Agent and the Paying Agents, and will provide that the Notes shall be redeemed on a date that is no later than the tenth Business Day after such notice is given by the Company in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement (the “Special Mandatory _Redemption Date”). On the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Paying_ Agents for payment to each Holder of Notes the Special Mandatory Redemption Price for such Holder’s Notes, shall be entitled to use the Escrowed Property to make such payments and, concurrently with the payment to such Holders, deliver any excess Escrowed Property (if any) to the Company. Notice of such Special Mandatory Redemption shall be given to the Holders of the Notes at least five Business Days before the Special Mandatory Redemption Date. The Escrow Accounts will not include cash to fund any accrued and unpaid interest owing to Holders of the Notes, which is included in the Special Mandatory Redemption Price. In the event that the Special Mandatory Redemption Price payable upon such Special Mandatory Redemption of the Euro Fixed Rate Notes, Euro FRN Notes or Dollar Fixed Rate Notes exceeds the amount of the applicable Escrowed Property, Topco will be required to make an equity contribution to the Company to fund the difference between the applicable Special Mandatory Redemption Price and the amount of the Escrowed Property pursuant to a commitment provided by it. The Company or the applicable Issuer from time to time, but not more than twice in aggregate, may open one or more replacement or additional accounts at an alternative bank or banks, which in each case must be an Initial Purchaser or one or more of their respective banking affiliates, and may transfer any portion of the Escrowed Property to any such replacement or additional accounts (a “Transfer”) without such Transfer being deemed a Release; provided that the Company and each Issuer provide a substantially equivalent security interest to the 224 ----- Trustee for the benefit of the Holders over such replacement or additional account or accounts if such security interest was initially granted in connection with the original Escrow Account; and provided further that use of the funds from any such account shall be subject to the same conditions as applied to the original Escrow Account. In such an event, any replacement or alternative accounts into which Escrowed Property is transferred shall be deemed to be an Escrow Account. Receipt by the Trustee from the Company or the applicable Issuer of an Officer’s Certificate in connection with a Transfer shall constitute deemed consent by the Trustee for the transfer of the Escrowed Property from the original Escrow Account to a new Escrow Account. If at the time of such Special Mandatory Redemption, the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and the rules of the Exchange so require, the Company will notify the Exchange that the Special Mandatory Redemption has occurred and any relevant details relating to such Special Mandatory Redemption. In addition, the conditions applicable to a Special Mandatory Redemption may be waived or modified by Holders representing a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, within 150 days from the Acquisition Closing Date and substantially concurrently with the guarantees granted in favor of obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Notes are expected to be guaranteed on a senior basis by thyssenkrupp Elevator Corp., thyssenkrupp Aufzüge GmbH, Tepper Aufzüge GmbH, thyssenkrupp Elevator (Canada) Limited., thyssenkrupp Elevator Manufacturing Inc., thyssenkrupp Stairlifts B.V., and SkyLift B.V. (the “Post-Closing Guarantors”). The Senior Facilities will be guaranteed on a senior basis by each Post-Closing Guarantor. In addition, the Original Guarantee Facility and the Original Revolving Credit Facility made available under the Senior Facilities Agreement will be guaranteed by thyssenkrupp Elevadores, S.L.U. which is barred from granting a guarantee of the Senior Term Facilities and a Note Guarantee pursuant to Spanish financial assistance laws. In addition, if required by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries” and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Note Guarantee in the future and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2020, on a consolidated basis and excluding statistical corporate cost allocations, the Post-Closing Guarantors generated 62.8% of the Target Group’s consolidated EBITDA and 44.5% of the Target Group’s consolidated sales. As of March 31, 2020, on a consolidated basis and excluding the value of the “thyssenkrupp” brand (the license for which will automatically terminate 18 months after the Acquisition Closing Date), the Post-Closing Guarantors accounted for 36.4% of the Target Group’s consolidated assets. The obligations of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. In addition, the Note Guarantees will be further limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles as described below under “Security—General.” The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Notes and the Topco Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent preference rules, “thin capitalization” rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims and similar matters, or where the time and cost of granting the guarantee would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee. For example, due to Spanish financial assistance laws thyssenkrupp Elevadores, S.L.U. is barred from granting a guarantee of the Senior Term Facilities and a Note Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes— Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral” and “—The insolvency laws of Germany and other applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable to you as the insolvency laws of the United States or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests (as defined herein), including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may adversely affect their validity and enforceability.” The validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in “Certain 225 ----- Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests.” The Company is a holding company and its only material assets are its interests in the capital and loan stock of its Subsidiaries. The Dollar Issuer is an indirect subsidiary of the Company and, as of the consummation of the Acquisition, its only material assets will be its interests in the capital and loan stock of its Subsidiaries. As such, the Issuers will be dependent upon the Restricted Subsidiaries to make payments to them to service interest, principal and other payments on the Notes. A significant portion of the operations of the Company will be conducted through Subsidiaries that are not expected to become Guarantors, including Subsidiaries exempt from becoming Guarantors or having security granted over their shares or assets under the Agreed Security Principles. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantors, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries and claims against joint ventures generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries and joint ventures over the claims of creditors of the Issuers and the Guarantors, including Holders. The Notes and each Note Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Company (other than the Guarantors) and joint ventures. Although the Indenture limits the incurrence of Indebtedness (including Disqualified Stock, and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries), the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture does not impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness under the Indenture.

In addition, within 150 days from (and excluding) the Acquisition Closing Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and substantially simultaneously with the obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be secured by (collectively, the “Post-Closing Collateral” and, together with the Issue Date Collateral, the “Collateral”): - share pledges in respect of the shares in the capital of thyssenkrupp Elevator Corp., thyssenkrupp Aufzüge GmbH, Tepper Aufzüge GmbH, thyssenkrupp Elevator (Canada) Limited and thyssenkrupp Elevator Manufacturing Inc.; and - security over substantially all assets (subject to customary exceptions) of the Post-Closing Guarantors incorporated in the United States and Canada. The Collateral will also secure the Senior Facilities on a pari passu basis and may also secure certain Hedging Obligations, any Additional Notes as well as certain other future Indebtedness. A portion of the Collateral, the Topco Shared Collateral (as defined under “Description of the Senior Notes”), will also secure the Senior Notes and certain other future Indebtedness on a senior subordinated basis. In addition, under certain circumstances, including a repayment in full of the amounts outstanding under the Senior Term Facilities, any Revolving Facility (including the Original Revolving Facility) Incurred pursuant to sub-clause (i)(A)(3), and any Guarantee 227 ----- Facility (including the Original Guarantee Facility) Incurred pursuant to sub-clause (i)(A)(4), in each case of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “Limitation on Indebtedness” below, may be re-designated as a “super senior” obligation under the Intercreditor Agreement, and following such re-designation, Holders will only receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral after the obligations thereunder (and certain super senior Hedging Obligations) have been paid in full. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements— Intercreditor Agreement” and “—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.” Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants— Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with future issuances of Indebtedness or Indebtedness of the Restricted Subsidiaries, including, subject to certain requirements described herein, Additional Notes, as permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The Collateral (other than the Escrow Charge) will be granted to the Security Agent on behalf of the Holders and holders of the other secured obligations that are secured by the Collateral pursuant to the Security Documents. Any other assets subject to Security Interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations under the Notes, any Note Guarantees and the Indenture would also constitute “Collateral.” All Collateral will be subject to the limitations that are applicable to Note Guarantees granted by the same entity, the operation of the Agreed Security Principles and any Permitted Collateral Liens. The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders. No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with the offering of the Notes. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—The value of the Collateral securing the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes and such Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances.” The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations, see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests.” Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” certain property, rights and assets may not be pledged, and any pledge over property, rights and assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles.

- a key factor in determining whether or not (and the terms on which) a guarantee or security will be taken (and in respect of the security, the extent of its perfection and/or registration) is the applicable time and cost (including adverse effects on taxes, interest deductibility, stamp duty, registration costs and taxes, notarial costs, translation costs and all applicable legal fees and adverse effects on the ability of the Group to obtain or maintain local facilities or other financing arrangements, including any factoring or similar arrangement in each case permitted under the Indenture) which will not be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the secured parties of obtaining such guarantee or security;

- guarantees and security will be limited so that the aggregate of notarial costs and all registration and like taxes and duties relating to the provision of security will not exceed an amount to be agreed between the Company and the Security Agent; - where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of granting security over the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such security, security will be granted over the material assets only; - it is expressly acknowledged that it may be either impossible or impractical to create security over certain categories of assets in which event security will not be taken over such assets; - any asset subject to a legal requirement, contract, lease, license, instrument, regulatory constraint (including any agreement with any government or regulatory body) or other third party arrangement (other than restrictions contained in the constitutional documents of a member of the Group or in any intra-Group loan agreement), which may prevent or condition the asset from being charged, secured or being subject to the applicable security document (including requiring a consent of any third party, supervisory board or works council (or equivalent)) and any asset which, if subject to the applicable security document, would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations with respect to any member of the Group in respect of the asset or require the relevant chargor to take any action materially adverse to the interests of the Group or any member thereof, in each case will be excluded from a guarantee or security document;

The Security Documents will be entered into by the relevant security provider and the Security Agent as agent for the secured parties. When entering into such Security Documents, the Security Agent will act in its own name, but for the benefit of the secured parties (including itself, the Trustee and the Holders from time to time). Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent also acts as an agent of the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the holders of any Topco Notes and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations in relation to the Security Interests created in favor of such parties. In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of Security Interests, the relevant Security Documents will secure “parallel debt” obligations created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent (and not the obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees). The parallel debt construct has not been fully tested under the law in certain of these jurisdictions. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—The security interests in the Notes Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Notes Collateral may be restricted by local law.” Each Escrow Charge shall be granted solely for the benefit of the Trustee on behalf of the Holders of the applicable series of Notes, and no other persons (including for the avoidance of doubt any lender under the Senior Facilities Agreement, any holder of Senior Notes, counterparties under any Hedging Obligations or any other creditors) shall be entitled to benefit from the Escrow Charges. The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, only the Security Agent will have the right to enforce the Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, Holders will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee under the Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent. The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes and the Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by Security Interests in the Collateral until all obligations under the Notes and the Indenture have been discharged. However, the Security Interests with respect to the Notes and the Indenture may be released under certain circumstances as provided under “—Security—Release of Liens.” In the event that the Company or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the Security Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in the Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the Security Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement was successful, the Holders may not be able to recover any amounts under the Security Documents. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—The granting of the Guarantees and security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening or voidance periods for such security interests in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions.”",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

Within 60 days following any Change of Control, the Issuers will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control as described below. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuers will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The Issuers may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuers repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control may constitute a default under the Senior Facilities Agreement that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder and trigger the Change of Control offer requirement under the Senior Notes Indentures and other financing arrangements of a Parent Entity. Future Indebtedness of the Issuers or the Company’s subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuers to repurchase the 241 ----- Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuers. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Issuers’ ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by their then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuers could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuers will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuers and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described under “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Issuers to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuers’ obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuers will notify the Exchange of any Change of Control Offer.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

In the event that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”) the Notes no longer have an Investment Grade Rating or a Rating Agency withdraws its Investment Grade Rating or downgrades the rating assigned to the relevant series of Notes below an Investment Grade Rating (in each case, to the extent given an Investment Grade Rating by such Rating Agency), then the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture with respect to future events. The period of time between the Suspension Date and the Reversion Date is referred to in this description as the “Suspension Period.” The Note Guarantees (other than the Note Guarantee of the Company in respect of the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes) will be suspended during the Suspension Period. Additionally, upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event, the amount of Excess Proceeds from any Asset Dispositions shall be reset to zero. During the Suspension Period, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be entitled to incur Liens to the extent provided for under “—Limitation on Liens” (including, without limitation, Permitted Liens) and any Permitted Liens which may refer to one or more Suspended Covenants shall be interpreted as though such applicable Suspended Covenant(s) continued to be applicable during the Suspension Period (but solely for purposes of the “—Limitation on Liens” covenant and the “Permitted Liens” and “Permitted Collateral Liens” definitions and for no other covenant). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any such reinstatement, no action taken or omitted to be taken by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries prior to such reinstatement will give rise to a Default or Event of Default under the Indenture, and no Default or Event of Default will be deemed to exist or have occurred as a result of any failure by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to comply with any of the Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period; provided, that (1) with respect to Restricted Payments (as defined herein) made after such reinstatement, the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments will be calculated as though the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period (including with respect to a Applicable Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period); (2) all Indebtedness incurred, committed or issued during the Suspension Period (or deemed incurred or issued in connection with an Applicable Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period) will be classified to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (iv)(A) of the second paragraph of “—Limitation on Indebtedness;” (3) any Affiliate Transaction (as defined herein) entered into after such reinstatement pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (vi) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions;” (4) any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Dollar Issuer or a Guarantor to take any action described in clauses (i) through (iii) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (i) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries;” (5) no Subsidiary of the Company shall be required to comply with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries” after such reinstatement with respect to any guarantee or obligation entered into by such Subsidiary during any Suspension Period; and (6) all 243 ----- Investments made during the Suspension Period (or deemed made in connection with an Applicable Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period) will be classified to have been made under clause (i) of the definition of “Permitted Investments.” Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated after the Reversion Date, (1) no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind will be deemed to exist under the Indenture, the Notes or the Note Guarantees with respect to the Suspended Covenants, and none of Midco or any of its Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period, or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising during any Suspension Period, in each case as a result of a failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period (or, upon termination of the Suspension Period or after that time based solely on any action taken or event that occurred during the Suspension Period), and (2) following a Reversion Date, the Company and each Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted, without causing a Default or Event of Default, to honor, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments or obligations arising during any Suspension Period and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby. There can be no assurance that any series of Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Rating. The Trustee shall be notified of a Covenant Suspension Event. The Trustee shall have no duty to (i) monitor the ratings of the Notes, (ii) ascertain whether a Covenant Suspension Event or Reversion Date have occurred, or (iii) notify the Holders of any of the foregoing.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

provided that the amount of any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of any outstanding Indebtedness may (in the Company’s sole discretion) be increased by the amount of all such accrued and/or capitalized interest, accreted value, original issue discount and/or additional Indebtedness in respect of such Indebtedness and such Increased Amount will not be deemed to be Indebtedness for the purpose of calculating any basket, permission or threshold under which such Refinancing Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes and other Senior Secured Indebtedness, as the case may be, surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the amount offered in the Asset Disposition Offer (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Company shall prepay, repay or purchase the Notes and such Senior Secured Indebtedness, as the case may be, on a pro rata basis based on the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of the Notes or such Senior Secured Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes or Senior Secured Indebtedness, as the case may be, will be repurchased in part in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any such Asset Disposition Offer (or Advance Offer), the amount of Excess Proceeds that resulted in the requirement to make an Asset Disposition Offer shall be reset to zero (0) (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds upon such completion).

An Asset Disposition Offer or Advance Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, the Notes and/or the Note Guarantees (but the Asset Disposition Offer or Advance Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents).

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The provisions under the Indenture related to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such indebtedness not denominated in euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amount into its Euro Equivalent amount determined as of a date selected by the Company that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period. The Senior Facilities Agreement may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Company becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuers from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this covenant.

The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines (after consultation with counsel) is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against all fees, losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed in writing of such occurrence by the Company, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Company. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

The Escrow Agreement shall provide for the Escrow Agent to release from each Escrow Account, upon instruction of the Company, a portion of the Escrowed Property in an amount equal to the amount of accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from, and including, the Issue Date or the most recent interest payment date, as applicable, to, but excluding, any interest payment date prior to the Escrow Release in order to satisfy the interest payment obligations in respect of the Euro Fixed Rate Notes or the Dollar Fixed Rate Notes, as applicable, under the Indenture as set forth under “—Principal, Maturity and Interest.” In addition, the Escrow Agent will be entitled pursuant to the Escrow Agreement to deduct amounts from the Escrowed Property in respect of negative interest having accrued on the Escrowed Property. Other than in connection with the payment of interest and Additional Amounts, if any, as set forth in the previous paragraph, the Company will be entitled to cause the Escrow Agent to release Escrowed Property (in which case the Escrowed Property will be paid to, or as directed by, the Company) (the “Escrow Release”) (the date of the Escrow Release being referred to as the “Escrow Release Date”) upon delivery to the Escrow Agent, on or prior to December 31, 2020 (the “Escrow Longstop Date”), of an Officer’s Certificate (the “Escrow Release Officer’s _Certificate”), upon which the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely absolutely without further investigation,_ certifying that the following conditions (collectively, the “Escrow Conditions”) will be met substantially concurrently with or promptly following the Release on the Escrow Release Date: (1) the funds required to pay the consideration for the Acquisition will be required promptly (and in any event within two Business Days) following the release of the Escrowed Property to consummate the Acquisition substantially on the terms set forth under “Summary-The Transactions”; and (2) the conditions precedent to borrowing under the Senior Facilities (other than any condition precedent relating to the Release or satisfaction of the Escrow Conditions) shall have been, or substantially concurrently shall be, satisfied or waived in all material respects. Upon the Escrow Release, the Escrowed Property will be paid out of the Escrow Accounts in accordance with the Escrow Agreement for the purposes described under “Use of Proceeds” and the Escrow Accounts will be reduced to zero. In the event that (i) the Escrow Longstop Date occurs and the Escrow Agent shall not have received the Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate on or prior to such date or (ii) the Company informs the Escrow Agent and the Trustee in writing that, in the good faith judgment of the Company, the Acquisition will not be consummated on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, (the date of any such event being the “Special Termination Date”), the Company will redeem the entire outstanding aggregate principal amount of each series of the Notes (the “Special _Mandatory Redemption”) at a price (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Price”) equal to 100% of the issue_ price of such series of Notes as stated on the cover page of this offering memorandum, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes and Additional Amounts, if any, from, and including, the Issue Date to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below), subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. Notice of the Special Mandatory Redemption will be delivered by the Company no later than one Business Day following the Special Termination Date, to the Trustee, the Escrow Agent and the Paying Agents, and will provide that the Notes shall be redeemed on a date that is no later than the tenth Business Day after such notice is given by the Company in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement (the “Special Mandatory _Redemption Date”). On the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Paying_ Agents for payment to each Holder of Notes the Special Mandatory Redemption Price for such Holder’s Notes, shall be entitled to use the Escrowed Property to make such payments and, concurrently with the payment to such Holders, deliver any excess Escrowed Property (if any) to the Company. Notice of such Special Mandatory Redemption shall be given to the Holders of the Notes at least five Business Days before the Special Mandatory Redemption Date. The Escrow Accounts will not include cash to fund any accrued and unpaid interest owing to Holders of the Notes, which is included in the Special Mandatory Redemption Price. In the event that the Special Mandatory Redemption Price payable upon such Special Mandatory Redemption of the Euro Fixed Rate Notes or Dollar Fixed Rate Notes exceeds the amount of the applicable Escrowed Property, Parentco will be required to make an equity contribution to the Company to fund the difference between the applicable Special Mandatory Redemption Price and the amount of the Escrowed Property pursuant to a commitment provided by it. 338 ----- The Company from time to time, but not more than twice in aggregate, may open one or more replacement or additional accounts at an alternative bank or banks, which in each case must be an Initial Purchaser or one or more of their respective banking affiliates, and may transfer any portion of the Escrowed Property to any such replacement or additional accounts (a “Transfer”) without such Transfer being deemed a Release; provided that the Company provide a substantially equivalent security interest to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders over such replacement or additional account or accounts if such security interest was initially granted in connection with the original Escrow Account; and provided further that use of the funds from any such account shall be subject to the same conditions as applied to the original Escrow Account. In such an event, any replacement or alternative accounts into which Escrowed Property is transferred shall be deemed to be an Escrow Account. Receipt by the Trustee from the Company of an Officer’s Certificate in connection with a Transfer shall constitute deemed consent by the Trustee for the transfer of the Escrowed Property from the original Escrow Account to a new Escrow Account. If at the time of such Special Mandatory Redemption, the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and the rules of the Exchange so require, the Company will notify the Exchange that the Special Mandatory Redemption has occurred and any relevant details relating to such Special Mandatory Redemption. In addition, the conditions applicable to a Special Mandatory Redemption may be waived or modified by Holders representing a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655
291_2,Offering 2020.md,61,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR NOTES,61.10,Note Guarantees,61.10.1,General,"On the Issue Date, the obligations of the Company under the Notes and the Indenture will be, jointly and severally, unconditionally guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis (the “Note Guarantees”) by the Initial Guarantors. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, within 150 days from the Acquisition Closing Date and substantially concurrently with the guarantees granted in favor of obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Notes are expected to be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by thyssenkrupp Elevator Corp., thyssenkrupp Aufzüge GmbH, Tepper Aufzüge GmbH, thyssenkrupp Elevator (Canada) Limited., thyssenkrupp Elevator Manufacturing Inc., thyssenkrupp Stairlifts B.V., and SkyLift B.V. (the “Post-Closing _Guarantors”). The Senior Facilities will be guaranteed on a senior basis by each Post-Closing Guarantor. In_ addition, the Original Guarantee Facility and the Original Revolving Credit Facility made available under the Senior Facilities Agreement will be guaranteed by thyssenkrupp Elevadores, S.L.U. which is barred from granting a guarantee of the Senior Term Facilities and a Note Guarantee pursuant to Spanish financial assistance laws. In addition, if required by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries” and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Note Guarantee in the future and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2020, on a consolidated basis and excluding statistical corporate cost allocations, the Post-Closing Guarantors generated 62.8% of the Target Group’s consolidated EBITDA and 44.5% of the Target Group’s consolidated sales. As of March 31, 2020, on a consolidated basis and excluding the value of the “thyssenkrupp” brand (the license for which will automatically terminate 18 months after the Acquisition Closing Date), the Post-Closing Guarantors accounted for 36.4% of the Target Group’s consolidated assets. The obligations of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. In addition, the Note Guarantees will be further limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles as described below under “Security—General.” The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Secured Notes and the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent preference rules, “thin capitalization” rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims and similar matters, or where the time and cost of granting the guarantee would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee. For example, due to Spanish financial assistance laws thyssenkrupp Elevadores, S.L.U. is barred from granting a guarantee of the Senior Term Facilities and a Note Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Note 339 ----- Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral” and “—The insolvency laws of Germany and other applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable to you as the insolvency laws of the United States or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests (as defined herein), including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may adversely affect their validity and enforceability.” The validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests.” The Company is a holding company and its only material assets are its interests in the capital and loan stock of its Subsidiaries. As such, the Company will be dependent upon the Restricted Subsidiaries to make payments to it to service interest, principal and other payments on the Notes. A significant portion of the operations of the Company will be conducted through Subsidiaries that are not expected to become Guarantors, including Subsidiaries exempt from becoming Guarantors or having security granted over their shares or assets under the Agreed Security Principles. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantors, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries and claims against joint ventures generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries and joint ventures over the claims of creditors of the Company and the Guarantors, including Holders. The Notes and each Note Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Company (other than the Guarantors) and joint ventures. Although the Indenture limits the incurrence of Indebtedness (including Disqualified Stock, and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries), the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture does not impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness under the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”",N/A,as_expected,2020,655
291_2,Offering 2020.md,61,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR NOTES,61.10,Note Guarantees,61.10.2,Subordination of the Note Guarantees,"The Note Guarantees will be senior subordinated indebtedness, which means that, pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture, the Note Guarantees will rank behind, and will be expressly subordinated to, all the existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantors, including any obligations under the Senior Facilities, the Secured Notes and any future Indebtedness ranking pari passu therewith. As a result of this subordination, holders of Senior Indebtedness of any Guarantor will be entitled to receive full payment on all obligations owed to them before any payment can be made to Holders of the Notes in respect of such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee. The ability to take enforcement action against the Guarantors is subject to significant restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement, and potentially any Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date. For example, the ability of the Trustee or the Holders to take enforcement action with respect to the Note Guarantees will be subject to certain standstill provisions and payment blockage and other limitations on enforcement. The Trustee and the Holders will not be able to enforce the Note Guarantees until the expiration of the applicable standstill period (generally 179 days) for so long as amounts under Senior Indebtedness remain outstanding. In addition, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be subject to release under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, the sale of Midco pursuant to an enforcement of security over shares of Midco taken by the Security Agent acting at the direction of an instructing group of senior secured creditors. Because of the foregoing subordination provisions, it is likely that holders of Senior Indebtedness and other creditors (including trade creditors) of the Guarantors would recover disproportionately more than the holders of the Notes recover in any insolvency or similar proceeding relating to such entity. In any such case, there may be insufficient assets, or no assets, remaining to pay the principal of or interest on the Notes after the repayment in full of all Senior Indebtedness.

Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee without the consent of the Holders and will not require any other action or consent on the part of the Trustee.

Upon receipt by the Trustee of either an Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate or a notice of Special Mandatory Redemption, the Escrowed Property will be released and the first-priority security interests over the Escrowed Property will automatically be released and terminate. In addition, the Notes and the Note Guarantees in respect thereof will be secured on the Issue Date (collectively, the “Collateral”): - on a first-priority basis by: (i) a share pledge in respect of Parentco’s shares in the capital of the Company pursuant to a German law governed share pledge agreement; (ii) a security assignment in respect of any structural intercompany receivables owed to Parentco by the Company pursuant to a German law governed security assignment agreement; and (iii) a pledge in respect of the Company’s material bank accounts in Germany (without control over use and freely operational prior to acceleration) pursuant to a German law governed bank account pledge agreement (collectively, the “Topco Independent Collateral”); and - on a second-priority basis by: (i) a share pledge in respect of the Company’s shares in the capital of Midco pursuant to a German law governed share pledge agreement; and (ii) a security assignment in respect of any structural intercompany receivables owed to the Company by Midco pursuant to a German law governed security assignment agreement (collectively, the “Topco Shared Collateral”). The Collateral will also secure the Private Notes, and may also secure any Additional Notes, as well as certain future Indebtedness, on a pari passu basis. The Topco Shared Collateral will also secure the Senior Facilities and the Secured Notes, and may also secure certain Hedging Obligations and certain future Indebtedness, on a firstpriority basis. The Notes will not benefit from any security interests in the Post-Closing Collateral (as defined under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes”). Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants— Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with future issuances of Indebtedness or Indebtedness of the Restricted Subsidiaries, including, subject to certain requirements described herein, Additional Notes, as permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. 341 ----- The Collateral (other than the Escrow Charge) will be granted to the Security Agent on behalf of the Holders and holders of the other secured obligations that are secured by the Collateral pursuant to the Topco Security Documents. Any other assets subject to Security Interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations under the Notes, any Note Guarantees and the Indenture would also constitute “Collateral.” All Collateral will be subject to the limitations that are applicable to Note Guarantees granted by the same entity, the operation of the Agreed Security Principles and any Permitted Collateral Liens. The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders. No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with the offering of the Notes. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—The value of the Collateral securing the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes and such Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances.” The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations, see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests.” Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” certain property, rights and assets may not be pledged, and any pledge over property, rights and assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles. The following is a non-exhaustive summary of certain terms of the Agreed Security Principles, which include, among others: - general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance, anti-trust and other competition authority restrictions, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, equitable subordination, “transfer pricing”, “thin capitalization”, “earnings stripping”, “controlled foreign corporation” and other tax restrictions, “exchange control restrictions”, “capital maintenance” rules and “liquidity impairment” rules, tax restrictions, retention of title claims, employee consultation or approval requirements and similar principles may limit the ability of a member of the Group to provide a guarantee or security or may require that the guarantee or security be limited as to amount or otherwise and, if so, the guarantee or security will be limited accordingly provided that, to the extent requested by the Security Agent before signing any applicable security or accession document, the relevant member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavors (but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or security document shall be subject to such limit; - a key factor in determining whether or not (and the terms on which) a guarantee or security will be taken (and in respect of the security, the extent of its perfection and/or registration) is the applicable time and cost (including adverse effects on taxes, interest deductibility, stamp duty, registration costs and taxes, notarial costs, translation costs and all applicable legal fees and adverse effects on the ability of the Group to obtain or maintain local facilities or other financing arrangements, including any factoring or similar arrangement in each case permitted under the Indenture) which will not be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the secured parties of obtaining such guarantee or security; - members of the Group will not be required to give guarantees or enter into security documents if they are not wholly owned by another member of the Group or if it is not within the legal capacity of the relevant members of the Group or if it would conflict with the fiduciary or statutory duties of their officers or contravene any applicable legal, regulatory or contractual prohibition or restriction or have the potential to result in a material risk of personal or criminal liability for any officer of or for any member of the Group;

- the giving of a guarantee, the granting of security and the registration and/or the perfection of the security granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the relevant member of the Group to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course as otherwise permitted by the Finance Documents (as defined in the section entitled “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements— Intercreditor Agreement” above) (including dealing with the secured assets and all contractual counterparties or amending, waiving or terminating (or allowing to lapse) any rights, benefits or obligations, in each case prior to an Acceleration Event (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) which is continuing), and any requirement under the Agreed Security Principles to seek consent of any person or take or not take any other action shall be subject to the Agreed Security Principles; - any security document will only be required to be notarized if required by law in order for the relevant security to become effective or admissible in evidence; - no guarantee or security will be required to be given by or over any acquired person or asset (and no consent shall be required to be sought with respect thereto) which are required to support Acquired Indebtedness to the extent such Acquired Indebtedness is permitted by the Indenture to remain outstanding after an acquisition. No member of a target group or other entity acquired pursuant to an acquisition permitted by the Indenture shall be required to become a Guarantor or grant security with respect to the Notes if prevented by the terms of the documentation governing that acquired indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness or any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of such Acquired Indebtedness) or if becoming a Guarantor or the granting of any security would give rise to an obligation (including any payment obligation) under or in relation thereto; no security will be granted over any asset secured for the benefit of any debt permitted by the Indenture and/or to the extent constituting a Permitted Lien unless specifically required by a Finance Document to the contrary; - no title investigations or other diligence on assets will be required and no title insurance will be required; - security will not be required over any assets subject to security in favor of a third party (other than in relation to security under general business conditions of account banks which do not prohibit or prevent the creation of security over such accounts) or any cash constituting regulatory capital or customer cash (and such assets or cash shall be excluded from any relevant security document); - to the extent legally effective, all security will be given in favor of the Security Agent and not the secured creditors individually (with the Security Agent to hold one set of security documents for all secured parties); “parallel debt” provisions will be used where necessary (and included in the Intercreditor Agreement and not the individual security documents); no member of the Group will be required to take any action in relation to any guarantees or security as a result of any assignment or transfer by a secured party; - guarantees and security will not be required from or over the assets of, any joint venture or similar arrangement, any minority interest or any member of the Group that is not wholly-owned by another member of the Group; - each security document shall be deemed not to restrict or condition any transaction permitted under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement and the security granted under each security document shall be deemed to be subject to these Agreed Security Principles, before and after the execution of the relevant security document and creation of the relevant security; 343 ----- - no security may be provided on terms which are inconsistent with the turnover or sharing provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement; - the secured parties (or any agent or similar representative appointed by them at the relevant time) will not be able to exercise any power of attorney or set-off granted to them under the terms of the Finance Documents prior to the occurrence of an Acceleration Event which is continuing; - no guarantee or security shall guarantee or secure any “Excluded Swap Obligations” defined in accordance with the LSTA Market Advisory Update dated February 15, 2013 entitled “Swap Regulations’ Implications for Loan Documentation”, and any update thereto by the LSTA; - other than a general filing relating to a floating charge or blanket lien, no perfection, filing or other action will be required with respect to assets of a type not owned by members of the Group or not in Australia, Canada, any member state of the EU, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States (including any state thereof and the District of Columbia) (each, a “Guarantor Jurisdiction”) or otherwise over the shares of a member of the Group not located in a Guarantor Jurisdiction; - no translation of any document relating to any security or any asset subject to any security will be required to be prepared or provided to the secured parties, unless (i) required for such documents to become effective or admissible in evidence and (ii) an Acceleration Event is continuing; and - no security shall be provided to the extent it would constitute or may constitute unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of articles 143 or 150 (as applicable) of the Spanish Companies Act or any equivalent provision of any other applicable law.

The circumstances in which the holders of the Notes may instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action in respect of the Security Interests over the Topco Shared Collateral are significantly limited. Generally, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the holders of firstranking security interests in the Topco Shared Collateral will be entitled to control virtually all decisions relating to the exercise of remedies with respect to these security interests, will be able to block enforcement of such security interests, will be able to release the security interests constituting Topco Shared Collateral in certain circumstances and will receive any proceeds from the enforcement of those security interests before amounts will be available to the holders of the Notes.

When entering into such Topco Security Documents, the Security Agent will act in its own name, but for the benefit of the secured parties (including itself, the Trustee and the Holders from time to time). Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent also acts as an agent of the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the holders of the Secured Notes and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations in relation to the Security Interests created in favor of such parties. In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of Security Interests, the relevant Topco Security Documents will secure “parallel debt” obligations created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent (and not the obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees).

The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Notes Collateral may be restricted by local law.” Each Escrow Charge shall be granted solely for the benefit of the Trustee on behalf of the Holders of the applicable series of Notes, and no other persons (including for the avoidance of doubt any lender under the Senior Facilities Agreement, any holder of Secured Notes or Private Notes, counterparties under any Hedging Obligations or any other creditors) shall be entitled to benefit from the Escrow Charges. The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, only the Security Agent will have the right to enforce the Topco Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, Holders will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee under the Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent. In addition, prior to the discharge of obligations under the Senior Facilities, the Secured Notes, certain Hedging Obligations and other obligations constituting priority indebtedness under the Intercreditor Agreement, the representatives of the Holders will be subject to a 179-day standstill on the taking of any enforcement action over the Topco Shared Collateral. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Topco Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes and the Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by Security Interests in the Collateral until all obligations under the Notes and the Indenture have been discharged. However, the Security Interests with respect to the Notes and the Indenture may be released under certain circumstances as provided under “—Security—Release of Liens.” In the event that the Company or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the Security Interests created under the Topco Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in the Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the Security Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement was successful, the Holders may not be able to recover any amounts under the Topco Security Documents. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—The granting of the Guarantees and security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening or voidance periods for such security interests in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions.”",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of: (1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or Note Guarantee is made by or on behalf of any Payor or the Paying Agent or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (including the jurisdiction of the Paying Agent); or 351 ----- (2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes, or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing _Jurisdiction”),_ will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor or the Paying Agent with respect to any Note or any Note Guarantee, including (without limitation) payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments, after such withholding or deduction (including any such withholding or deduction from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been received in respect of such payments on any such Note or Note Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, _however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:_ (1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in or place of management present in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Note, the Indenture or a Note Guarantee; (2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner of the Note to comply with a reasonable written request of the Payor addressed to the Holder or beneficial owner, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such withholding or deduction would be payable), to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a law, statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, all or part of such Tax, but, in each case, only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to do so; (3) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed as a result of the presentation of the Note for payment (where Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and presentation is required) more than 30 days after the later of the applicable payment date or the date the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period); (4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment with respect to the Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee; (5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes; (6) any Taxes imposed, deducted or withheld pursuant to section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) or otherwise imposed pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, in each case, as of the Issue Date (and any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable), any current or future regulations or agreements thereunder, official interpretations thereof or similar law or regulation implementing an intergovernmental agreement relating thereto; (7) any U.S. federal back-up withholding tax under section 3406 of the Code; or (8) any combination of the items (1) through (7) above. In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or any Person other than the beneficial owner of the Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settler with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner held such Notes directly. The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will provide certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of such other reasonable evidence as is available of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee (with a 352 ----- copy to the Paying Agent). Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent. If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment made on any Note or any Note Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary. Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Senior Notes” there is mentioned, in any context: (1) the payment of principal; (2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of the Notes; (3) interest; or (4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Note Guarantee, such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof. The Payor will pay and reimburse each applicable Holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, issuance, delivery, registration, enforcement of, or receipt of payments with respect to any Notes, any Note Guarantee, the Indenture, or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (in each case, other than in connection with a transfer after this offering) and limited, solely to the extent of such taxes or similar charges or levies that arise from the receipt of any payments of principal or interest on the Notes, to any such taxes or similar charges or levies that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (3) and (5) through (8) (save that in respect of clause (5), this proviso shall not apply in connection with transfer, personal property or similar Taxes). The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to the Notes (or any Note Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such successor Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655
291_2,Offering 2020.md,61,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR NOTES,61.20,Change of Control,61.20.1,,"The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless a (i) third party makes a Change of Control Offer or (ii) the Company previously or substantially concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described in the seventh paragraph under this heading “—Change of Control,” the Company will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes (provided that Euro Fixed Rate Notes of €100,000 or less in principal amount, and Dollar Fixed Rate Notes of $200,000 or less in principal amount, may only be redeemed in whole and not in part) pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the date of repurchase; provided that if the repurchase date is on or after the record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment date, then Holders in whose name the Notes are registered at the close of business on such record date will receive interest on the repurchase date. Within 60 days following any Change of Control, the Company will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control as described below. 353 ----- To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The Company may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Company repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control may constitute a default under the Senior Facilities Agreement that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder and trigger the Change of Control offer requirement under the Secured Notes Indenture, the Private Notes Indenture and other financing arrangements of a Parent Entity. Future Indebtedness of the Company or its subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Company to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Company. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Company’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by their then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Company could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described under “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules of the Exchange so require, the Company will notify the Exchange of any Change of Control Offer. 354 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

If and while the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants, the Notes will be entitled to substantially less covenant protection. In the event that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”) the Notes no longer have an Investment Grade Rating or a Rating Agency withdraws its Investment Grade Rating or downgrades the rating assigned to the relevant series of Notes below an Investment Grade Rating (in each case, to the extent given an Investment Grade Rating by such Rating Agency), then the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture with respect to future events. The period of time between the Suspension Date and the Reversion Date is referred to in this description as the “Suspension Period.” The Note Guarantees will be suspended during the Suspension Period. Additionally, upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event, the amount of Excess Proceeds from any Asset Dispositions shall be reset to zero. During the Suspension Period, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be entitled to incur Liens to the extent provided for under “—Limitation on Liens” (including, without limitation, Permitted Liens) and any Permitted Liens which may refer to one or more Suspended Covenants shall be interpreted as though such applicable Suspended Covenant(s) continued to be applicable during the Suspension Period (but solely for purposes of the “—Limitation on Liens” covenant and the “Permitted Liens” and “Permitted Collateral Liens” definitions and for no other covenant). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any such reinstatement, no action taken or omitted to be taken by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries prior to such reinstatement will give rise to a Default or Event of Default under the Indenture, and no Default or Event of Default will be deemed to exist or have occurred as a result of any failure by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to comply with any of the Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period; provided, that (1) with respect to Restricted Payments (as defined herein) made after such reinstatement, the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments will be calculated as though the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period (including with respect to a Applicable Transaction entered into 355 ----- during the Suspension Period); (2) all Indebtedness incurred, committed or issued during the Suspension Period (or deemed incurred or issued in connection with an Applicable Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period) will be classified to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (iv)(A) of the second paragraph of “—Limitation on Indebtedness;” (3) any Affiliate Transaction (as defined herein) entered into after such reinstatement pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (vi) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions;” (4) any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to take any action described in clauses (i) through (iii) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (i) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries;” (5) no Subsidiary of the Company shall be required to comply with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries” after such reinstatement with respect to any guarantee or obligation entered into by such Subsidiary during any Suspension Period; and (6) all Investments made during the Suspension Period (or deemed made in connection with an Applicable Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period) will be classified to have been made under clause (i) of the definition of “Permitted Investments.” Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated after the Reversion Date, (1) no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind will be deemed to exist under the Indenture, the Notes or the Note Guarantees with respect to the Suspended Covenants, and none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period, or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising during any Suspension Period, in each case as a result of a failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period (or, upon termination of the Suspension Period or after that time based solely on any action taken or event that occurred during the Suspension Period), and (2) following a Reversion Date, the Company and each Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted, without causing a Default or Event of Default, to honor, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments or obligations arising during any Suspension Period and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby. There can be no assurance that any series of Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Rating. The Trustee shall be notified of a Covenant Suspension Event.

For the purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness or liquidation preference of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred, or, at the option of the Company, first committed or first incurred or upon execution of the definitive documentation in respect thereof (whichever yields the lower Euro Equivalent); provided that, if such determination is made with respect to Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (x) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (y) the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees), including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred or payable in connection with such refinancing. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. The Company will not Incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any Senior Indebtedness of the Company unless such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes on substantially identical terms, and no Guarantor will Incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor unless such Indebtedness ranks pari passu with such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee or is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee on substantially identical terms; provided that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Company or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured with different collateral or by virtue of being secured on a junior 363 ----- priority basis or by virtue of the application of waterfall or other payment ordering provisions affecting different tranches of the Notes or where such ranking or subordination arises as a matter of law.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes and other Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the amount offered in the Asset Disposition Offer (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Company shall prepay, repay or purchase the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, on a pro rata basis based on the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of the Notes or such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes or Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, will be repurchased in part in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any such Asset Disposition Offer (or Advance Offer), the amount of Excess Proceeds that resulted in the requirement to make an Asset Disposition Offer shall be reset to zero (0) (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds upon such completion). Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset Disposition Offer, any remaining Net Available Cash shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Company may use such Net Available Cash for any purpose permitted by the Indenture.

An Asset Disposition Offer or Advance Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, the Notes and/or the Note Guarantees (but the Asset Disposition Offer or Advance Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents). Pending the final application of the amount of any Net Available Cash pursuant to this covenant, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness, or otherwise use such Net Available Cash in any manner permitted by the Indenture. 373 ----- The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer or an Advance Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The provisions under the Indenture related to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such indebtedness not denominated in euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amount into its Euro Equivalent amount determined as of a date selected by the Company that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period. The Senior Facilities Agreement and the Secured Notes Indenture may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Company becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Company from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Company is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Company could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Company does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Company’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

If any Applicable Metric is determined by reference to the greater of a fixed amount (the “numerical _permission”) and a percentage of LTM EBITDA (the “grower permission”) and the grower permission of the_ Applicable Metric exceeds the applicable numerical permission at any time as a result of an acquisition or Investment that is permitted under the Indenture, the numerical permission shall be deemed to be increased to the highest amount of the grower permission reached from time to time as a result of any such acquisitions and/or investments and shall not subsequently be reduced as a result of any decrease in the grower permission. Subject to the limitations imposed under clause (ii) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “Limitation on Indebtedness,” if a proposed action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) is incurred or entered into pursuant to a fixed permission and at a later time would subsequently be permitted under a ratio-based permission, unless otherwise elected by the Company, such action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) shall automatically be reclassified to such ratio-based permission. For any relevant Applicable Metric set by reference to a fiscal year, a calendar year, a Relevant Period, a four-quarter period, a twelve-month period or any other similar annual period (each an “Annual Period”): (i) at the option of the Company, the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during such Annual Period may be increased by: (A) an amount equal to 100% of the difference (if positive) between the permitted amount in the immediately preceding Annual Period and the amount thereof actually used or applied by the Group during such preceding Annual Period (the “Carry Forward Amount”); and/or (B) an amount equal to 100% of the permitted amount in the immediately following Annual Period and the permitted amount in such immediately following Annual Period shall be reduced by such corresponding amount (the “Carry Back Amount”); and (ii) to the extent that the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during such Annual Period is increased in accordance with clause (i) above, any usage of such Applicable Metric during such Annual Period shall be deemed to be applied in the following order: (A) first, against the Carry Forward Amount; (B) second, against the maximum amount so permitted during such Annual Period prior to any increase in accordance with clause (i) above; and (C) third, against the Carry Back Amount.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines (after consultation with counsel) is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against all fees, losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed in writing of such occurrence by the Company, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Company. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders.

Through and including the 40th day after the later of the commencement of the offering of the Notes and the closing of the Offering (the “distribution compliance period”), Regulation S BookEntry Interests will be limited to persons that have accounts with DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or persons who hold interests through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, and any sale or transfer of such interest to U.S. persons shall not be permitted during such period unless such resale or transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to (i) a person who takes delivery in the form of 144A Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indentures) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a qualified institutional buyer within the meaning of Rule 144A under the Securities Act in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A under the Securities Act or (ii) otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction. Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in “Transfer Restrictions,” Book-Entry Interests may be transferred and exchanged as described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Transfer and Exchange.” Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes of any series that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note of such series will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note, and accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it retains such a Book-Entry Interest. In connection with transfers involving exchanges between Regulation S Book-Entry Interests and 144A BookEntry Interests, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the relevant Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the other relevant Global Note. Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only as described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and “Description of the _Senior Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee and the_ Registrar a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indentures) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such notes.

The Issuers provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuers, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the 446 ----- Paying Agents, the Transfer Agents, the Registrars nor any of their respective agents are responsible for those operations or procedures. DTC advised the Issuers that it is a limited purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the U.S. Exchange Act. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity issues, corporate and municipal debt issues, and money market instruments (that DTC’s direct participants deposit with DTC). DTC also facilitates the post trade settlement among direct participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between direct participants’ accounts. DTC is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant, either directly or indirectly. Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations and also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions, such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes only through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream participants.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

It does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all German tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase Notes and, in particular, does not consider any specific facts or circumstances that may apply to a particular purchaser. This summary is based on the tax laws of Germany currently in force and as applied on the date of this offering memorandum, which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive or retrospective effect. Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes, including the effect of any state or local or church taxes under the tax laws of Germany and any country of which they are residents or whose tax laws apply to them for other reasons.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

The withholding tax rate to be withheld by the Disbursing Agent is 25% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being 26.375%, plus church tax, if applicable). Church tax will be collected by the Disbursing Agent by way of withholding unless the holder has filed a blocking notice (Sperrvermerk) with the German Federal Central Tax Office (Bundeszentralamt für _Steuern) in which case the holders will have to include the income in the tax return and will then be assessed for_ church tax. The Issuers of the Notes should under German law not be required to deduct withholding tax from the proceeds of the investment in the Notes. The same treatment applies to capital gains (i.e., the difference between the proceeds from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment after deduction of expenses directly related to the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment and the cost of acquisition taking into account currency gains and losses, if any) and interest accrued on the Notes (“Accrued Interest,” Stückzinsen) derived by an individual holder who is a German tax resident irrespective of any holding period provided that the Notes have been held in a custodial account with the same Disbursing Agent since the time of their acquisition. If interest coupons or interest claims are disposed of separately (i.e., without the Notes), the proceeds from the disposition are subject to withholding tax. The same applies to proceeds from the redemption of interest coupons or the payment of interest claims if the Notes have been disposed of separately. To the extent that the Notes have not been kept or administered in a custodial account with the same Disbursing Agent since the time of their acquisition, upon their disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment withholding tax applies at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being 26.375%, plus church tax, if applicable) on 30% of the disposal proceeds (plus Accrued Interest, if any), unless the current Disbursing Agent has been provided with evidence of the actual acquisition costs of the Notes by the previous Disbursing Agent or by a statement of a bank or financial services institution within the European Union, the EEA or the countries/territories Luxembourg, Austria, the Swiss Confederation, the Principality of Liechtenstein, the Republic of San Marino, the Principality of Monaco, the Principality of Andorra, Curacao and Sint Maarten. If the withholding tax on a disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes has been calculated on the basis of 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather than from the actual gain), a German tax resident individual holder may also apply for an assessment on the basis of its actual acquisition costs; however, in case the actual gain is higher than 30% of the disposal proceeds a German tax resident individual holder is obliged to apply for an assessment on the basis of its actual acquisition costs. In computing any German withholding tax, the Disbursing Agent may generally deduct from the basis of the withholding tax negative investment income realized by the individual holder of the Notes via the Disbursing Agent (e.g., losses from the sale of other securities with the exception of shares). The Disbursing Agent may also deduct Accrued Interest on the Notes or other securities paid separately upon the acquisition of the respective security via the Disbursing Agent. In addition, subject to certain requirements and restrictions, the Disbursing 449 ----- Agent may credit foreign withholding taxes levied on investment income in a given year regarding securities held by the individual holder in the custodial account with the Disbursing Agent. Upon the individual holder filing an exemption certificate (Freistellungsauftrag) with the Disbursing Agent, the Disbursing Agent will take a maximum annual allowance (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of €801 (€1,602 for married couples and for partners in accordance with the registered partnership law (Gesetz über die Eingetragene _Lebenspartnerschaft) filing jointly) into account when computing the amount of tax to be withheld from the_ gross payment to be made by the Disbursing Agent. No withholding tax will be deducted if the holder of the Notes has submitted to the Disbursing Agent a certificate of non-assessment (Nichtveranlagungsbescheinigung) issued by the competent tax authorities. German withholding tax will generally not apply to gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of Notes held by a corporate holder who is a German tax resident (including via a commercial partnership, as the case may be, and provided that in the case of corporations of certain legal forms the status of corporation has been evidenced by a certificate of the competent tax authorities) while ongoing payments, such as interest payments, are subject to withholding tax (irrespective of any deductions of foreign tax and losses incurred).

Income derived from capital investments under the Notes held by an individual holder who is tax resident in Germany is in general subject to German income tax at a flat-tax rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and church tax, if applicable, thereon) (Abgeltungsteuer) if the Notes are held as private investment (Privatvermögen). Individual holders who are tax resident in Germany are entitled to a maximum annual allowance (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of €801 (€1,602 for married couples and for partners in accordance with the registered partnership law (Gesetz über die Eingetragene Lebenspartnerschaft) filing jointly), whereby actually incurred higher expenses directly attributable to a capital investment are not deductible. The personal income tax liability of an individual holder who is tax resident in Germany on income from capital investments under the Notes will, in principle, be satisfied by the tax withheld (as described under “—Withholding Tax” above). To the extent that withholding tax has not been levied, such as in the case of Notes kept in custody abroad or if no Disbursing Agent being involved in the payment process or if the withholding tax on disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment has been calculated from 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather than the actual gain), the individual holder must include its interest income and capital gains derived from the Notes in its annual tax return and will then also be taxed at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax thereon). Further, an individual holder may apply for a taxation of all investment income of a given year at its lower individual tax rate based upon an assessment to tax with any amounts over-withheld being refunded. In each case, the deduction of expenses (other than transaction costs) on an itemized basis is not permitted. Losses incurred with respect to the Notes may only be offset with investment income of the individual holder realized in the same or following assessment periods. Pursuant to recent legislative changes, losses arising from a bad debt loss (Forderungsausfall), a waiver of a receivable (Forderungsverzicht) or a transfer of an impaired receivable to a Third-party or from any other default can only be offset against other income from capital investments and only up to an amount of €10,000 per year. Respective losses exceeding the amount of €10.000 can be carried forward and might be usable in future tax periods (together with current capital investment losses of each such tax period) up to an amount of €10.000 per year. Where Notes form part of a trade or business of an individual or corporate holder or the income from the Notes qualifies as income from the letting and leasing of property, the withholding tax, if any, will not satisfy the 450 ----- personal or corporate income tax liability. Rather, the income is subject to individual or corporate income tax (plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax). Where Notes form part of a trade or business, interest (including Accrued Interest) and capital gains must be taken into account as income. The respective holder must include income and related (business) expenses in the annual tax return and the balance will be taxed at the holder’s applicable tax rate. Withholding tax levied, if any, will be credited as advance payment against the personal or corporate income tax liability of the holder or, to the extent exceeding this personal or corporate income tax liability, be refunded. Where Notes form part of a German trade or business the current income and gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes may also be subject to German trade tax (Gewerbesteuer). The trade tax liability depends on the municipal trade tax factor (Gewerbesteuerhebesatz).

Because of the possibility of such payments, the Notes may be treated as contingent payment debt instruments under the applicable Treasury regulations, in which case the timing and amount of income inclusions and the character of income recognized may be different from the consequences discussed herein. Although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the possibility of such additional amounts payable on the Notes is a remote or incidental contingency within the meaning of applicable Treasury regulations as of the date hereof, and thus does not result in the Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments under applicable Treasury regulations. Therefore, we do not intend to treat the potential payment of additional interest or the potential payment of a premium pursuant to the optional redemption, redemption for tax reasons or withholding tax provisions as part of the yield to maturity of the Notes. Our determination that this contingency is remote or incidental is binding on a holder, unless such holder explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year during which it acquires the Notes that it is taking a different position. However, our position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a contrary position to that described above, among other adverse tax consequences, a holder may be required to accrue income on its Notes in excess of stated interest, and to treat as ordinary income rather than capital gain any income recognized on the taxable disposition of a Note, and, with respect to a U.S. Holder of a EUR Note, to recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to such income in a manner different than that described below.

This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income, special tax accounting rules that apply as a result of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account on an applicable financial statement, or to holders subject to special rules, such as banks, broker dealers, mutual funds, certain financial institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, individual retirement and other tax deferred accounts, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities, holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax exempt entities, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships, subchapter S corporations, or other pass through entities or arrangements and investors in such entities or arrangements, persons liable for alternative minimum tax, persons subject to the base erosion and anti-abuse tax, “controlled foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies,” and corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax, entities covered by the anti-inversion rules and persons holding the Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion transaction” or other integrated transaction. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase the relevant Notes in the offering hereby at the “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of such Notes is sold for money, not including sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers), and who hold the Notes as capital assets (generally, property held for investment) within the meaning of section 1221 of the Code. If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the U.S. tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership. A partnership considering an investment in the Notes, and partners in such a partnership, should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes. The summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations set forth below is for general information purposes only. Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax 452 ----- consequences of holding Notes in light of their particular circumstances, including the application of the U.S. federal income tax considerations discussed below, as well as the application of U.S. federal estate and gift tax laws and state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

A U.S. Holder of a EUR Note that uses the cash method of tax accounting will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of the euro denominated interest payment on a EUR Note based on the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars.

Subject to the discussion below, the adjusted_ tax basis of a Note to a U.S. Holder will generally be, with respect to a USD Note, the original purchase price of such Note and, with respect to a EUR Note, the U.S. dollar value of the euro purchase price calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of purchase. The amount realized by a U.S. Holder upon the disposition of a Note will generally be, with respect to a USD Note, the amount received by such U.S. Holder and, with respect to a EUR Note, the U.S. dollar value of the euros received calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of disposition. Any capital gain or loss will be long term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Notes exceeds one year on the date of disposition. Long term capital gains recognized by non-corporate U.S. Holders are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. Capital gain or loss, if any, recognized by a U.S. Holder generally will be treated as U.S. source income or loss for purposes of calculating the U.S. foreign tax credit limitation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. 454 ----- If the EUR Notes are traded on an established securities market, a U.S. Holder that uses the cash method of tax accounting, and if it so elects, a U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of tax accounting, will determine the U.S. dollar values of its adjusted tax bases in a EUR Note and the amount realized on the disposition of a EUR Note by translating euro amounts at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase or the disposition, respectively.

That presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another Regulated Member State within the three month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. In addition, that presumption is rebuttable, and the relevant court of a Regulated Member State should carefully assess whether the center of main interests is genuinely located in that Regulated Member State. Specifically, it should be possible to rebut the presumption where the company’s central administration is located in a Regulated Member State other than that of its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other Regulated Member State (Recital (30) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation). When determining whether the center of main interests is ascertainable by third parties, special consideration should be given to the creditors and to their perception as to where a company conducts the administration of its interests. This may require, in the event of a shift of center of main interests, informing creditors of the new location from which the company is carrying out its activities in due course, for example by drawing attention to the change of address in commercial correspondence, or by making the new location public through other appropriate means (Recital (28) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation). If the center of main interests of the debtor is located in the Regulated Member State in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings under the Recast Insolvency Regulation shall be opened in that Regulated Member State and accordingly the courts of that Regulated Member State shall have jurisdiction to open any of the insolvency proceedings applicable in that Regulated Member State (see Annex A of the Recast Insolvency Regulation). Notwithstanding the opening of a main insolvency proceeding in a Regulated Member State, “secondary insolvency proceedings” may be opened in another Regulated Member State if such debtor possesses an “establishment” (as defined in Article 2(10) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation) in that Member State. The effects of these proceedings shall be restricted to the assets of the debtor in the territory of that Regulated Member State. If the debtor possesses an “establishment” in a Regulated Member State, “territorial proceedings” under Article 3(4) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation may be opened prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings, where (a) main insolvency proceedings cannot be opened because of the conditions laid down by the law of the Regulated Member State within the territory of which the center of the debtor’s main interests is situated or (b) the opening of territorial insolvency proceedings is requested by (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Regulated Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested or (ii) a public authority which, under the law of the Regulated Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. When main insolvency proceedings are opened, the territorial insolvency proceedings shall become secondary insolvency proceedings. In the event that the Issuers or any provider of collateral experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings will be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations of the Issuers and the collateral provided by the Issuers or any other company.

In the event of an insolvency of the EUR SSN Issuer, the SUN Issuer or a Guarantor organized under the laws of Germany and/or having its “center of main interests” in Germany (any other such Guarantor, a “German Notes Guarantor”) at the time the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) is filed, any main insolvency proceedings would most likely be initiated in Germany. Such proceedings would then be governed by German law. Under certain circumstances, insolvency proceedings may also be opened in Germany in accordance with German law over the assets of companies that are not established under German law (for example, if the center of main interests of such company is within Germany) or, vice versa, insolvency over the EUR SSN Issuer, the SUN Issuer or the German Notes Guarantors may be opened in other jurisdictions. See “—European Union.” The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors than the insolvency laws of the United States or another jurisdiction with which you may be familiar, including in respect of priority of creditors’ claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest as well as in certain circumstances priority recovery for secured creditors and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and thus may limit your ability to recover payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany: Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court ex officio, but require that the debtor and/or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of over indebtedness (Überschuldung) of the debtor or in the event of its illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit), meaning that the debtor is unable to pay 10% or more of its debts as and when they fall due for a period longer than three weeks. According to the relevant provision of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), a debtor is over indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation values), unless a continuation of the debtor’s business as a going concern is predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich) based on an up to two year forecast horizon (positive Fortführungsprognose). If a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter _Haftung), a public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft), a European law stock corporation based in_ Germany (Societas Europaea) or any other company not having an individual as personally liable shareholder or partner finds itself in a situation of illiquidity and/or over indebtedness, the management board or managing director(s) of such company and, in certain circumstances, its shareholders, are obligated to file for insolvency without undue delay but not later than three weeks after such illiquidity and/or over indebtedness occurred or (as the case may be) was established. Noncompliance with these obligations exposes management to both severe damages claims as well as sanctions under criminal law. In addition, only the debtor, but not the creditors, can file for the opening of insolvency proceedings in the event of imminent illiquidity (drohende _Zahlungsunfähigkeit), if there is the imminent risk of the company being unable to pay its debts as and when they_ fall due at some point in time within a certain prognosis period, whereas imminent illiquidity does not give rise to an obligation for the management of the debtor to file for insolvency proceedings. The Act to Temporarily Suspend the Obligation to File for Insolvency and to Limit Directors’ Liability in the Case of Insolvency Caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic, which was adopted on March 27, 2020 (the “COVInsAG”), provides for a suspension of the obligation to file for insolvency until September 30, 2020. The suspension applies unless the insolvency is not caused by consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic or there is no prospect of remedying the existing illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit). If the debtor was able to pay its debts on December 31, 2019—so that the debtor was not illiquid (zahlungsunfähig)—it is assumed that the insolvency was caused by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and that there are prospects of remedying an existing illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit). The COVInsAG also provides that insolvency proceedings based on creditors’ insolvency filings in the period from March 28, 2020 to June 28, 2020 can only be opened if the event of illiquidity or over indebtedness already existed on March 1, 2020. The Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection will be authorized by regulation to extend the suspension of the filing obligation and the suspension of creditors’ insolvency filings until March 31, 2021 if this appears to be necessary due to the continuing demand for available public aid, ongoing financing difficulties, or other circumstances. The COVInsAG also provides for a relief from claw-back for the repayment of loans provided during the suspension period or the provision of collateral for these claims. The same applies to payments which the creditor was entitled to receive or similar 460 ----- transactions unless the creditor knew that the restructuring and refinancing efforts of the debtor were not suitable to eliminate an existing illiquidity of the debtor in the meaning of section 17 of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). The insolvency proceedings are controlled by the competent insolvency court, which monitors the due performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take preliminary measures to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings insofar as these protective measures are reasonable to protect the debtor’s assets and/or to ensure the continuation of the debtor’s business. Unless the debtor has applied for debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) (in which event the court will generally only appoint a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter) who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor) the insolvency court will in most cases appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter). The rights and duties of the preliminary administrator depend on the decision of the court. The duties of the preliminary administrator may include safeguarding and preserving the debtor’s property and assessing whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. Depending on the decision of the court, even the right to manage the business and dispose of the assets of the debtor may pass to the preliminary insolvency administrator. The insolvency court can also order a stay of all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors against the debtor and other measures the court sees as appropriate. If a company faces imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and/or is over indebted (überschuldet), but not illiquid (zahlungsunfähig), it may also file for preliminary “debtor in possession” moratorium proceedings (Schutzschirmverfahren) unless—from a third party perspective—there is no reasonable chance for a successful restructuring. Upon such filing by the debtor, the court will appoint a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger _Sachwalter) and prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to immoveable assets). It may also_ implement other preliminary measures to protect the debtor from creditor enforcement actions for up to three months. During that period, the debtor shall prepare an insolvency plan which ideally shall be implemented in formal “debtor in possession” proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) after formal insolvency proceedings have been opened. During preliminary insolvency proceedings, the insolvency court has to appoint a “preliminary creditors’ committee” (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss) if the debtor satisfies at least two of the following three requirements: - a balance sheet total in excess of €6,000,000 (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor is over indebted); - revenues of at least €12,000,000 in the twelve months prior to the last day of the financial year preceding the filing; and/or - fifty or more employees on an annualized average basis. The preliminary creditors’ committee will be able to participate in certain important decisions made in the preliminary insolvency proceedings. It will have, for example, the power to influence the following: the selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter)/preliminary trustee (vorläufiger _Sachwalter) and an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter)/ trustee (Sachwalter); and court orders for_ “debtor in possession” proceedings (Anordnung der Eigenverwaltung). The court opens formal insolvency proceedings (Eröffnung des Insolvenzverfahrens) if certain formal requirements are met, including if (i) the debtor is in a situation of imminent illiquidity (if the petition has been filed by the debtor), illiquidity and/or over indebtedness and (ii) if there are sufficient assets to cover at least the cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient to cover such costs, the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if third parties (e.g., creditors), advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings will usually be refused for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse). Unless the court has granted debtor in possession status (Eigenverwaltung) (in which case the court will only appoint a trustee (Sachwalter) who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor), upon opening of the insolvency proceedings, the court will appoint an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) who has full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s assets, whereas the debtor is no longer entitled to dispose of its assets. The insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) will only be entitled to change the individual 461 ----- appointed as insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste _Gläubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by heads and amount_ of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual to become insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual being eligible as officeholder, i.e., sufficiently qualified, business experienced and impartial. The insolvency administrator (or in the case of debtor in possession proceedings, the debtor) may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s operations, and satisfaction of these liabilities as preferential debts of the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) will be preferred to any insolvency liabilities created by the debtor including the Note Guarantees. The insolvency administrator or trustee may also challenge transactions that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the opening of the insolvency proceedings (See “—Hardening Periods, Fraudulent Transfer and Amendments of German Restructuring Laws by the _Restructuring Directive”)._ For the holders of the Notes, the consequences of the opening of German insolvency proceedings against the EUR SSN Issuer, the SUN Issuer or any German Notes Guarantor subject to the German insolvency regime would include the following: (a) unless the court orders debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), the right to administer and dispose of the EUR SSN Issuer’s, the SUN Issuer’s or a German Notes Guarantor’s assets would generally pass to the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the insolvency estate; (b) unless the court orders debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), disposals effected by the EUR SSN Issuer’s, the SUN Issuer’s or a German Notes Guarantor’s management after the opening of insolvency proceedings are null and void by operation of law; (c) if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings, a creditor in the insolvency proceedings acquires through execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest in part of the debtor’s property that would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (d) claims against the EUR SSN Issuer, the SUN Issuer or any German Notes Guarantor may generally only be pursued in accordance with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung); and (e) any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderung), i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not constitute part of the insolvency estate, does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for separation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator. Certain of these consequences could be achieved by decision of the insolvency court following the insolvency petition and prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings. Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses” entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, upon the opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte oder Lösungsklauseln) may be invalid if they frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator whether or not to perform the contract (Wahlrecht des Insolvenzverwalters) unless they reflect termination rights applicable under statutory law. This may also relate to agreements that are not governed by German law. All other creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to segregate an asset from the insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) or are preferred creditors (Massegläubiger) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht)), who wish to assert claims against the debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings and have to file their claims against the debtor and the rights they claim in the assets of the debtor with the insolvency administrator. With the exception of certain secured creditors, an individual enforcement action brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is subject to an automatic stay once the insolvency proceedings have been opened (and, if so ordered by a court, also between the time when an insolvency petition is filed and the time when insolvency proceedings commence). German insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims in the insolvency proceedings separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Accordingly, unsecured creditors may file their claims in the insolvency proceedings and will be paid on a pro rata basis from the insolvency estate (to the extent sufficient assets are available). Secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce their security interests after insolvency proceedings have been commenced to the extent the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) authorizes the insolvency 462 ----- administrator to dispose of the relevant collateral but have only certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) in the insolvency proceedings. In this case, secured creditors will only have a right to claim the recoveries (minus costs and fees) from such realization. Whether or not, after the initiation of insolvency proceedings, a secured creditor remains entitled to enforce security granted to it by the relevant debtor depends on the type of security: The insolvency administrator generally has the sole right (i) to realize any movable assets within its possession that are subject to preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) (e.g., pledges over movable assets and rights (Mobiliarpfandrechte), transfer by way of security (Sicherungsübereignung)) and (ii) to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). According to some voices in legal literature, it is uncertain whether the secured creditors are entitled to initiate the enforcement process in respect of pledged uncertificated shares on their own or, insofar as the pledged assets are part of any insolvency estate, whether the insolvency administrator has standing to realize the pledges on behalf of and for the benefit of the secured creditors. However, there is no authoritative case law on this question. Even if the law vests the right of disposal regarding the relevant collateral in the insolvency administrator, the secured creditor retains the right of preferred satisfaction with regard to the disposal proceeds (Absonderungsrecht). Consequently, the enforcement proceeds minus certain contributory charges of 9% (or more as agreed upon individually) for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets and (ii) realizing the secured assets are paid to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. Remaining amounts (“excess proceeds”) will be allocated to the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) and would, after deduction of the costs of the insolvency proceedings (e.g., fees for and expenses of the preliminary insolvency administrator, the insolvency administrator and the insolvency court as well as the members of the creditors’ committee) and after satisfaction of certain preferential liabilities be distributed among the non-preferential unsecured creditors, including the holders of the Notes (to the extent not satisfied after enforcement of the Collateral securing the Notes). If the EUR SSN Issuer, the SUN Issuer or a German Notes Guarantor or a subsidiary subject to German insolvency proceedings grants security over its assets to creditors other than the holders of the Notes, such security may result in a preferred satisfaction of creditors secured by such security (however, the preferential treatment would be limited to the proceeds obtained through the disposal of the relevant collateral). The excess proceeds resulting from such collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Notes by the EUR SSN Issuer, the SUN Issuer or the German Notes Guarantors after such secured creditors have been satisfied. The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the insolvency administrator from using a movable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency administrator, however, must compensate the creditor in accordance with specific rules. In addition, it may take several years before proceeds from the liquidation of the insolvency estate, if any, are distributed to unsecured creditors. A different distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and which requires, in principle, the consent of the debtor as well as the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules. Under German insolvency laws, it is possible to implement a debt to equity swap through an insolvency plan. However, it will not be possible to force a creditor into a debt to equity conversion if it does not consent to such debt to equity swap. In case of protective shield proceedings (Schutzschirmverfahren), upon request of the debtor, the court will prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to immovable assets) and may implement other preliminary measures to protect the debtor from credit enforcement actions for up to three months in order to allow the debtor to prepare an insolvency plan if an independent expert testifies that the restructuring of the debtor’s business is not obviously futile (offensichtlich aussichtslos) and that the debtor is not already illiquid. Under German insolvency law, there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency. In the case of a group of companies, each entity, from an insolvency law point of view, has to be dealt with separately. As a consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather claims of and vis à vis each entity have to be dealt with separately. Under the act to facilitate the mastering of group insolvencies (Gesetz zur Erleichterung der Bewältigung von _Konzerninsolvenzen), which came into force on April 21, 2018, however, the coordination of and cooperation_ between insolvency proceedings of group companies are facilitated. Whereas this act does not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies or pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, it stipulates four key amendments of the German Insolvency Code in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may assume jurisdiction for other group company insolvency proceedings (Gruppen Gerichtsstand); (ii) a single person may be appointed as insolvency administrator for all relevant group 463 ----- companies is facilitated; (iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for “coordination proceedings” (Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a “coordinator” (Verfahrenskoordinator) with the ability to propose a “coordination plan” (Koordinationsplan). As a general principle, the claims arising from the Notes or a guarantee may be enforced against the EUR SSN Issuer, the SUN Issuer or a German Notes Guarantor outside of the insolvency proceedings over the assets of the EUR SSN Issuer, the SUN Issuer or the relevant German Notes Guarantor, as applicable. Any insolvency proceeding over the assets of the EUR SSN Issuer or the SUN Issuer would, however, be a rather strong indication that the overall financial situation of the entire group of affiliated companies has significantly deteriorated, which may cause a German Notes Guarantor to subsequently file for insolvency. German insolvency law provides for certain creditors and their claims to be subordinated by law (including, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor for the return of repayment of shareholder loans or comparable actions). The restrictive nature of the covenants and undertakings in the Indentures may result in the holders of the Notes and/or the applicable Trustee being considered in a “shareholder like position” (gesellschafterähnliche Stellung). In that event, in an insolvency proceeding over the assets of the EUR SSN Issuer, the SUN Issuer or a German Notes Guarantor, the claims arising from the Notes or a Note Guarantee would be treated as a subordinated insolvency claim (nachrangige Insolvenzforderungen). Subordinated insolvency claims are not eligible to participate in the insolvency proceedings over the assets of the EUR SSN Issuer, the SUN Issuer or a German Notes Guarantor unless the insolvency court handling the case has granted special permission allowing these subordinated insolvency claims to be filed which is not granted in the vast majority of insolvency cases governed by German law. Claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors. Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such time unless and until the insolvency administrator opts for performance. _Limitations on Enforcement_ Some of the German Notes Guarantors are incorporated in Germany in the form of a limited liability company (Gesellschaft _mit_ _beschränkter_ _Haftung—”GmbH”)_ and/or a stock corporation (“Aktiengesellschaft”). Consequently, the granting of guarantees, indemnities and security interests by these companies is subject to certain provisions of the German Limited Liability Company Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit _beschränkter Haftung, “GmbHG”), the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) and other laws. These_ provisions would also apply to any future German Notes Guarantor in the form of a GmbH or a partnership with a GmbH as unlimited liability partner (e.g., GmbH & Co. KG) or Aktiengesellschaft. _German GmbH Limitation Language—General_ As a general rule, sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (“Sections 30 and 31”) prohibit a GmbH from disbursing its assets to its direct or indirect shareholders, to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s net assets (i.e., assets minus liabilities and liability reserves) is already less or would fall below the amount of its stated share capital (Stammkapital). The granting or enforcement of guarantees or security interests by a GmbH in order to guarantee or secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company may be considered disbursements under Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to issue guarantees or create security interests to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries in the legal form of a GmbH or partnership with a GmbH as unlimited liable partner incorporated or established in Germany. Pursuant to such limitation language, the beneficiaries of the guarantees or the security interests agree, subject to certain adjustments and exemptions, to enforce the guarantees or the security interests against the German subsidiary only to the extent that such enforcement does not result in the GmbH’s (or, in case of a partnership with a GmbH as unlimited liable partner, such GmbH’s) net assets falling below its stated share capital or, as the case may be, if the net assets are already below the amount of its stated share capital, to cause such amount to be further reduced. Accordingly, the Note Guarantee, the Indenture and the Security Documents provided by the German Notes Guarantors contains or will contain, respectively, such limitation language and therefore the enforcement of the Note Guarantees, the Indenture and the Collateral is limited in the manner described. This could lead to a situation in which the respective guarantee or security granted by the relevant German Notes Guarantor cannot be enforced at all. 464 ----- _German AG Limitation Language—General_ As a general rule, Section 57 German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) prohibits the disbursement of the deposits to the stockholders (Verbot der Einlagenrückgewähr). In addition, pursuant to Section 71a German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) the relevant German public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft) may not grant any loan or grant and security to a third party for purposes of the acquisition of the stock in such German public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft). Any agreement in such respect is void. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to issue guarantees or create security interests to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Section 57 German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) and/or Section 71 a German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz), it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries in the legal form of a German public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft). Pursuant to such limitation language, the beneficiaries of the guarantees or the security interests agree to enforce the guarantees or the security interests against the German subsidiary only to the extent that such enforcement does not lead to a violation of Section 57 German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) and/or Section 71 a German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz). Accordingly, the Note Guarantee, the Indenture and the Security Documents relating to the Collateral provided by the German Notes Guarantors contains or will contain, respectively, such limitation language and therefore the enforcement of the Note Guarantees and the Indenture is limited in the manner described below. This could lead to a situation in which the respective guarantee or security granted by the relevant German Notes Guarantor cannot be enforced at all. In particular, thyssenkrupp Elevator, is incorporated in Germany in the form of a German public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft). As all the Note Guarantors are direct or indirect subsidiaries of thyssenkrupp Elevator, all limitations applicable to a German public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft) (whether by virtue of law or contractual limitation language) will consequently also apply to such subsidiaries even if incorporated in a legal form other than a German public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft). See also “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to each Series of the Notes and the Senior Secured Notes—Corporate benefit, _financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral.” German Limitation Language—“Wording”_ The limitation language for any GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG and public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft) incorporated into the relevant Notes Documents, in particular in the security documents, will substantially be in the form as follows: (a) Definitions In this paragraph: “AG” means (i) a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft, AG) incorporated under German law and/or (ii) a limited partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft) with a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft, AG) as general partner (Komplementär). “AG Guarantor” means any Guarantor which is an AG, any SE Guarantor and any KGaA Guarantor. “AktG” means the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz, AktG). “Auditor’s Determination” means the determination pursuant to paragraph (c)(iv) below. “BGB” means the German Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch, BGB). “DPLA” means a domination and/or profit and loss pooling agreement (Beherrschungs- und/oder _Gewinnabführungsvertrag) as defined in § 291 (1) AktG._ “EU Guarantor” means any limited liability company (or limited partnership with a limited liability company as its general partner) incorporated in a jurisdiction other than Germany whose centre of main interest (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 2015/848 of 20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings) is in Germany. “German Guarantor” means any AG Guarantor, any GmbH Guarantor and any EU Guarantor. “GmbH” means (i) a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung, GmbH) incorporated under German law and/or (ii) a limited partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft) with a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung, GmbH) as general partner (Komplementär). 465 ----- “GmbH Capital Impairment” means the GmbH Net Assets of a GmbH Guarantor falling below the amount (Entstehung einer Unterbilanz) required to maintain that GmbH Guarantor’s registered share capital (Stammkapital) or an increase of an existing shortage (Vertiefung einer Unterbilanz) of its registered share capital (Stammkapital) and thereby violating §§ 30, 31 GmbHG (including by way of any decrease of the GmbH Net Assets as a consequence of the existence, discharge or enforcement of any Limited Upstream Obligation against any subsidiary of a GmbH Guarantor). “GmbH Guarantor” means a Guarantor which is a GmbH. “GmbH Net Assets” means the net assets (Reinvermögen) of a GmbH Guarantor calculated in accordance with § 42 GmbHG, §§ 242, 264 HGB and the generally accepted accounting principles applicable (Grundsätze ordnungsgemäßer Buchführung) from time to time in Germany as adjusted pursuant to paragraph (c)(vi) below. “GmbHG” means the German Limited Company Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit _beschränkter Haftung, GmbHG)._ “HGB” means the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB) “KGaA” means a Guarantor which is a partnership limited by shares (Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien, _KGaA)._ “KGaA Guarantor” means a Guarantor which is a KGaA. “Limited Obligation” means any guarantee and any other liability, indemnity or other payment obligation under this Article or any other provision of the Notes Documents. “Limited Upstream Obligation” means any Limited Obligation if and to the extent such Limited Obligation secures or relates to liabilities which are owed by direct or indirect shareholders of the relevant Guarantor (upstream) or Subsidiaries of such shareholders (such Subsidiaries not to include the relevant Guarantor and the Subsidiaries of that relevant Guarantor) (cross-stream). “Liquidity Impairment” means a German Guarantor being deprived of the liquidity necessary to fulfil its liabilities towards its creditors and thereby violating § 64 sentence 3 GmbHG, §§ 92 (2) sentence 3, 278 (3) AktG and/or Art. 5 SE Regulation (as applicable to the relevant German Guarantor). “Management Notification” means the notification pursuant to paragraph (c)(iii) below. “SE” means a European company (Europäische Gesellschaft, SE) incorporated under German law. “SE **Guarantor”** means a Guarantor which is (i) an SE and/or (ii) a limited partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft) with a SE as general partner (Komplementär). “SE Regulation” means Council Regulation (EC) No 2157/2001 of 8 October 2001 on the Statute for a European company (SE). (b) AG Guarantee Limitation Language (i) Save as set out otherwise in this paragraph (b), none of the Holders and the Trustee shall enforce, and any AG Guarantor shall have a defense (Einrede) against any Limited Upstream Obligation of such AG Guarantor or of any Guarantor that is a subsidiary of such AG Guarantor. (ii) Any Limited Upstream Obligation granted by such AG Guarantor or by any Subsidiary of that AG Guarantor shall be enforceable (vollstreckbar) if at the time of enforcement of the Limited Upstream Obligation a DPLA (either directly or indirectly through an unbroken chain of domination and/or profit transfer agreements) exists between the relevant AG Guarantor whose obligations are secured by the relevant Limited Upstream Obligation as dominating company (herrschendes Unternehmen) and the relevant AG Guarantor as a dominated company (beherrschtes Unternehmen), provided that: (A) the AG Guarantor is a Subsidiary of the relevant Obligor whose obligations are secured by the relevant Limited Upstream Obligation; or (B) the AG Guarantor and the relevant Obligor whose obligations are secured by the relevant Limited Upstream Obligation are both Subsidiaries of a joint (direct or indirect) parent company with such parent company as dominating entity (herrschendes Unternehmen), in each case unless the mere existence of such a DPLA does not lead to the inapplicability of § 57 (1) and § 71a AktG (in connection with § 278 (3) AktG and/or Art. 5 SE Regulation, as applicable) as 466 ----- explicitly confirmed with reasons (and not, for example, as an obiter dictum) by the Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) in a third party case; and the loss compensation claim (Verlustausgleichsanspruch) of the AG Guarantor under such a DPLA would not be, or cannot be expected to be, fully valuable and recoverable (vollwertig) in the balance sheet of the AG Guarantor. (iii) Any Limited Upstream Obligation granted by such AG Guarantor or by any Subsidiary of that AG Guarantor shall be enforceable (vollstreckbar) if and to the extent such Limited Upstream Obligation is covered (gedeckt) by a fully valuable and recoverable consideration or recourse claim (vollwertiger _Gegenleistungs- oder Rückgewähranspruch) of the AG Guarantor against the affiliate whose_ obligations are secured by the relevant Limited Upstream Obligation and would therefore not lead to a violation of § 57 (1) AktG (in connection with § 278 (3) AktG and/or Art. 5 SE Regulation, as applicable), in each case unless it would lead to a violation of § 71a AktG. (iv) Any Limited Upstream Obligation granted by such AG Guarantor or by any Subsidiary of that AG Guarantor shall be enforceable (vollstreckbar) if and to the extent: (A) an amount utilized under this Agreement is applied for the repayment, prepayment or other refinancing of any financial indebtedness of such AG Guarantor or Subsidiary of such AG Guarantor; and (B) such exception does not lead to a violation of § 57 (1) or § 71a AktG (in connection with § 278 (3) AktG and/or Art. 5 SE Regulation, as applicable). (v) For the avoidance of doubt, the limits set out in this paragraph (b) shall no further apply from the date the relevant AG Guarantor is no longer incorporated as an AG unless such Guarantor is a Subsidiary of another AG Guarantor in which case this paragraph (b) shall apply in a way that the relevant Guarantor shall be treated as a Subsidiary of that other AG Guarantor in accordance with this paragraph (b). In such event, the limitations set out in this paragraph (b) shall not apply to the Limited Upstream Obligation granted by that Guarantor in respect of any liabilities which are owed by that other AG Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries. (c) GmbH Guarantee Limitation Language (i) Save as set out in this paragraph (c), the Holders and the Trustee shall not enforce, and any GmbH Guarantor (and/or relevant subsidiary of a GmbH Guarantor) shall have a defense (Einrede) against, any Limited Upstream Obligation if and to the extent a discharge (Erfüllung) or enforcement (Vollstreckung) in respect of a Limited Upstream Obligation would cause a GmbH Capital Impairment to occur. (ii) The restrictions in paragraph (i) shall not apply: (A) if and to the extent the Limited Upstream Obligation of the GmbH Guarantor secures any indebtedness under any Notes Document in respect of: (1) loans to the extent such loans are (directly or indirectly) on-lent or otherwise passed on to the relevant GmbH Guarantor or its Subsidiaries; or (2) bank guarantees or letters of credit that are issued for the benefit of any of the creditors of the GmbH Guarantor or the GmbH Guarantor’s Subsidiaries, in each case, to the extent that any such on-lending or otherwise passing on or bank guarantees or letters of credit are still outstanding at the time of the enforcement of the relevant Limited Upstream Obligation; for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this paragraph (ii) shall have the effect that such on-lent amounts may be enforced multiple times (no double dip); (B) if, at the time of enforcement of the Limited Upstream Obligation, a DPLA (either directly or indirectly through an unbroken chain of domination and/or profit transfer agreements) exists between the relevant Obligor whose obligations are secured by the relevant Limited Upstream Obligation as dominating company (herrschendes Unternehmen) and the relevant GmbH Guarantor as a dominated company (beherrschtes Unternehmen), provided that: (1) the GmbH Guarantor is a Subsidiary of the relevant Obligor whose obligations are secured by the relevant Limited Upstream Obligation; or (2) the GmbH Guarantor and the relevant Obligor whose obligations are secured by the relevant Limited Upstream Obligation are both Subsidiaries of a joint (direct or indirect) parent company with such parent company as dominating entity (herrschendes Unternehmen), 467 ----- in each case unless the mere existence of such DPLA does not lead to the inapplicability of § 30 (1) sentence 1 GmbHG; (C) if and to the extent any payment under the Limited Upstream Obligation is covered (gedeckt) by a fully valuable and recoverable consideration or recourse claim (vollwertiger Gegenleistungs- oder Rückgewähranspruch) of the GmbH Guarantor against the relevant Obligor whose obligations are secured by the relevant Limited Upstream Obligation; or (D) if the relevant GmbH Guarantor has not complied with its obligations pursuant to paragraphs (iii) and/or (iv) (as applicable) below; however, if and to the extent that the relevant Limited Upstream Obligation has been enforced without regard to the restrictions contained in this paragraph (c) because the Management Notification and/or the Auditor’s Determination has not (or not in a timely manner) been delivered pursuant to paragraphs (iii) and/or (iv) (as applicable) below, but the Auditor’s Determination has then been delivered within four (4) months from its due date in accordance with paragraphs (iv) below, the Trustee shall upon demand of the GmbH Guarantor to the Trustee repay any amount received from the GmbH Guarantor which pursuant to the Auditor’s Determination would not have been available for enforcement, if the Auditor’s Determination had been delivered in a timely manner. (iii) If the relevant GmbH Guarantor does not notify the Trustee within fifteen (15) Business Days after the making of a demand against that German GmbH Guarantor under the relevant Limited Upstream Obligation: (A) to what extent such Limited Upstream Obligation is an upstream or cross-stream guarantee or indemnity; and (B) to what extent a GmbH Capital Impairment would occur as a result of an enforcement of the Limited Upstream Obligation (setting out in reasonable detail the amount of its GmbH Net Assets, providing an up-to-date pro forma balance sheet), then the restrictions set out in paragraph (i) above shall cease to apply until a Management Notification has been provided. (iv) if the Trustee disagrees with the Management Notification, it may within twenty (20) Business Days of its receipt, request the relevant GmbH Guarantor to provide to the Trustee within forty-five (45) Business Days of receipt of such request a determination by the Auditors or any other auditors of international standard and reputation appointed by the GmbH Guarantor (at its own cost and expense) setting out in reasonable detail the amount in which the payment under the Limited Upstream Obligation would cause a GmbH Capital Impairment subject to the terms set out under this paragraph (c). Save for manifest errors, the Auditor’s Determination shall be binding on all parties. (v) If, after it has been provided with an Auditor’s Determination which prevented it from demanding any or only partial payment under the Limited Upstream Obligation, the Trustee ascertains in good faith that the financial conditions of the GmbH Guarantor as set out in the Auditor’s Determination has substantially improved, the Trustee (acting reasonably) may, at the GmbH Guarantor’s cost and expense, arrange for the preparation of an updated balance sheet of the GmbH Guarantor by applying the same principles that were used for the preparation of the Auditor’s Determination by the auditors who prepared the Auditor’s Determination in order for such Auditors to determine whether (and, if so, to what extent) the Capital Impairment has been cured as result of the improvement of the financial condition of the GmbH Guarantor. The Trustee may not arrange for the preparation of an Auditor’s Determination prior to the expiry of three (3) months from the date of the issuance of the preceding Auditor’s Determination. The Trustee may only demand payment under the Limited Upstream Obligation to the extent the Auditors determine that the Capital Impairment have been cured. (vi) The GmbH Net Assets shall be adjusted as follows: (A) the amount of any increase in the registered share capital of the relevant GmbH Guarantor which was carried out after the relevant GmbH Guarantor became a party to any of the Indentures and made from retained earnings (Kapitalerhöhung aus Gesellschaftsmitteln) shall be deducted from the amount of the registered share capital (Stammkapital) of the relevant GmbH Guarantor if it is expressly prohibited under the Notes Documents and has been carried out without the prior written consent of the Agent; (B) the amount of non-distributable assets according to § 253 (6) HGB shall not be included in the calculation of GmbH Net Assets; 468 ----- (C) the amount of non-distributable assets according to § 268 (8) HGB shall not be included in the calculation of GmbH Net Assets; (D) the amount of non-distributable assets according to § 272 (5) HGB shall not be included in the calculation of GmbH Net Assets; and (E) loans or other liabilities incurred by the relevant GmbH Guarantor in willful or grossly negligent violation of the Notes Documents shall not be taken into account as liabilities. (vii) Where a GmbH Guarantor claims in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (c) that the Guarantee can only be enforced in a limited amount, it shall realize, to the extent lawful and within reasonable opinion commercially justifiable, any and all of its assets that are shown in the balance sheet with a book value (Buchwert) that is significantly lower than the market value of the assets and are not necessary for the relevant German GmbH Guarantor’s business (nicht betriebsnotwendig). (d) Liquidity Impairment Limitation Language (i) Save as set out in this paragraph (d), the none of the Holders and the Trustee shall enforce, and any German Guarantor shall have a defense (Einrede) against, any Limited Upstream Obligation if and to the extent a payment and/or enforcement in respect of a Limited Upstream Obligation would cause a Liquidity Impairment for such German Guarantor. (ii) Paragraphs (c)(iii), (c)(iv), (c)(v) and (c)(vii) above (including the repayment contemplated in paragraph (c)(ii)(D) above) shall apply mutatis mutandis to the restriction in paragraph (i) above provided that the relevant German Guarantor shall use best efforts to realize to the extent lawful any and all of its assets that are not necessary for the relevant German GmbH Guarantor’s business (nicht _betriebsnotwendig) (irrespective of whether it is commercially justifiable)._ (e) Where the provisions of this Section apply to a limited partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft), all references to the assets of a German Guarantor shall mutatis mutandis include a reference to the assets of the general partner (Komplementär) of such limited partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft). (f) In addition to the restrictions set out in paragraphs (b) through (e) above, if a German Guarantor demonstrates that, according to the decisions of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) or a higher regional court of appeals (Oberlandesgericht), the payment under and/or enforcement of any Limited Upstream Obligation against such German Guarantor would result in personal liability of its managing director(s) (Geschäftsführer) or director(s) (Vorstände) for a reimbursement of payments made under any Limited Upstream Obligation (including pursuant to § 43 GmbHG, § 93 AktG and/or § 826 BGB), the German Guarantor shall have a defense (Einrede) against the Limited Upstream Obligation to the extent required in order not to incur such liability. (g) The restrictions set out in this Section do not affect the rights of the Trustee to claim any outstanding amount again at a later point in time if and to the extent the restrictions set out in this paragraph would allow such claim at that later point in time. (h) For the avoidance of doubt, the validity and enforceability of any Limited Upstream Obligation granted by a German Guarantor or of any subsidiary of a German Guarantor in respect of any borrowing liabilities which are owed by German Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries shall not be limited under this Section. (i) Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the Trustee or a German Guarantor from claiming in court that payments under Section/or an enforcement of the Limited Upstream Obligations do or do not fall within the scope of §§ 30, 31, 43, 64 sentence 3 GmbHG, §§ 57, 71a, 92 (2), 93, 278 (3) AktG, Art. 5 SE Regulation and/or § 826 BGB (as applicable) or that the limitations set out in this Section are not required to avoid any violation of these laws or liability issues for any managing director or board director. (j) Nothing in this Section shall constitute a waiver (Verzicht) of any right granted under the Indenture or any other Notes Document to the Trustee or vice versa. (k) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Indenture, this Section and any rights and/or obligations arising out of it shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, German law.” _General Comments regarding German Limitation Language_ German capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance and financial assistance rules (including with respect to Sections 30, 31 and 64 sentence 3 GmbH and Sections 57, 71a and 92(2) sentence 3 AktG), are subject to evolving case law. We cannot assure you that future court rulings may not further limit the access of shareholders 469 ----- to assets of its subsidiaries constituted in the form of, as applicable, an AG, a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG, which can negatively affect the ability of the German Notes Guarantors to make payments on the Notes or the Note Guarantees or the enforceability of the Note Guarantees, the Indentures and the Security Documents relating to the Collateral (i.e. the share pledges and any other security interest) provided by the German Notes Guarantors. In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) regarding “destructive interference” (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation in which a shareholder deprives a GmbH of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a guarantee or other collateral granted by the German Notes Guarantors. In such a case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced, even to nil. Moreover, according to a decision of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a security agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about the stressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant collateral by disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting of the Note Guarantees or any Collateral by the German Notes Guarantors (including in the legal form of an AG). Furthermore, the beneficiary (e.g., a holder of the Notes) of a transaction qualifying as a repayment of the stated share capital of a grantor of a guarantee or security interest, as applicable, (e.g., the enforcement of such guarantee or security interest) could moreover become personally liable under exceptional circumstances. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the grantor of the guarantee or provider of security interest is close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto. _Parallel Debt; Security Interests_ Under German law, certain “accessory” security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) require that the pledgee and the creditor of the secured claim be the same person. Such accessory security interests (akzessorische _Sicherungsrechte) cannot be held on behalf of third parties who do not (yet) hold the secured claim, will_ automatically lapse to the extent a secured claims is settled, discharged or novated, and may not be assigned independently, but will automatically follow the claims they secure in case the relevant secured claim is assigned. The holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be party to the Security Documents. In order to permit the holders of the Notes from time to time to benefit from pledges granted to the Security Agent under German law, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of a “parallel debt.” Pursuant to the creation of the parallel debt, the Security Agent has its own separate and independent claim equal to each amount payable by each obligor under, in particular, the Notes. The pledges governed by German law will directly and exclusively (to the extent the Notes are concerned) secure the parallel debt rather than the obligations under the Notes or the holders of the Notes directly. The validity of the parallel debt concept and of the pledges granted under German law to secure such parallel debt has not been tested under German law, and there is no certainty that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability posed by German law. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted. In addition, holders of the Notes bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to _Each Series of Notes,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to each Series of the Senior Notes.”_ German law does not generally permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon enforcement of the pledge. The enforcement of a share pledge under German law usually requires the sale of the asset constituting the collateral through a formal process involving a public auction to which certain waiting periods and notice requirements apply. Under German law, it is unclear whether the security interest in the collateral gives the Security Agent the right to prevent other creditors of the entities having granted such security from foreclosing on and realizing the asset constituting the collateral. Some courts have held that certain types of security interests only give their holders priority (according to their ranking) in the distribution of any proceeds from the realization of the asset constituting the collateral and no right to intervene (i.e., the right to request the court to impose a stay on proceedings initiated by other creditors). 470 ----- _Hardening Periods, Fraudulent Transfer and Amendments of German Restructuring Laws by the Restructuring Directive_ Under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), an insolvency administrator or in the event that debtor in possession status has been granted, the trustee (Sachwalter) may also challenge (anfechten) transactions, performances or other acts that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and were effected prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings during applicable avoidance periods. The administrator’s or the trustee’s right to challenge transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions during the ten year period prior to the filing of the petition for commencement of insolvency proceedings. In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to EUR SSN Issuer, the SUN Issuer or the German Notes Guarantors based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the payment of any amounts to the holders of the Notes as well as the granting of collateral for or providing credit support for the benefit of the Notes could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or, as the case may be, trustee under the rules of avoidance as set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). In case the validity or enforceability of the Notes or any collateral in favor of the Notes is challenged successfully, the holder of the Notes may not be able to recover any amounts under the Notes or the relevant collateral. If payments have already been made under the Notes or collateral, any amounts received from a transaction that had been challenged would have to be repaid to the insolvency estate. In this case, holders of the Notes would only have a general unsecured claim under the Notes without preference in insolvency proceedings. In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which terms also include the provision of security or the repayment of debt) may be avoided in the following cases. - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (i) during the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings, if the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at the time such act was taken and the creditor knew of such illiquidity (or of circumstances that imperatively suggest that the debtor was illiquid) at such time, or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the creditor knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances imperatively suggesting such illiquidity or filing); whereby in each case an affiliated party shall be presumed to have been aware of the debtor’s insolvency or of the filing to open insolvency proceedings; - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) to which such creditor was not entitled or which was granted or obtained in a form in which or at a time at which such creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction, if (i) such act was taken during the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (ii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at such time or (iii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that imperatively suggest such detrimental effect); whereby in each case an affiliated party shall be presumed to have been aware of the detrimental nature of such transaction for the other creditors; - any transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable, provided it was entered into (i) during the three months prior to the filing of the petition of the commencement of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid at the time of such transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew of the illiquidity at such time or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings and the counterparty to such transaction knew of either the debtor’s illiquidity or such filing at the time of the transaction; whereby in each case an affiliated party shall be presumed to have been aware of the debtor’s illiquidity or of the filing to open insolvency proceedings; - any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security (including a guarantee) for a third party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings; - any act performed by the debtor (i) during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing with the intent to prejudice the 471 ----- insolvency creditors and the other party knew of such intention at the time of such act, with such knowledge being presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor’s illiquidity was imminent and that the transaction disadvantaged the other creditors (except for acts granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor, to obtain security or satisfaction to which such creditor was entitled, in which case such knowledge (solely) being presumed if such creditor knew that the debtor was illiquid and that the transaction disadvantaged the other creditors), (ii) except for such acts granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor, to obtain security (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) (whether or not it was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was entitled to such security or satisfaction), which may only be avoided if they were effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or at a time after the filing; - any non-gratuitous contract (entgeltlicher Vertrag) concluded between the debtor and an affiliated party (nahestehende Person) which directly operates to the detriment of the creditors can be challenged unless such contract was concluded earlier than two years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors as of the time the contract was concluded; - any act that provides security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for a shareholder loan made to the debtor or an economically similar claim if (i) in the case of the provision of security, the act took place during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition, or (ii) in the case of satisfaction, the act took place during the last year prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition. It being understood, that the regulation for shareholder loans does not apply (i) to shareholders which own 10% or less of the shares or interest and are not engaged in management and (ii) until the successful restructuring of the debtor in case a creditor for the first time acquires shares during over indebtedness, illiquidity or imminent illiquidity for the purpose of restructuring the debtor; and - any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a third party if (i) the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or thereafter and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor or surety provider (Garant oder Bürge) (in which case the shareholder has to compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)). In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor (e.g., a German Notes Guarantor) was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if it knew of the debtor’s imminent illiquidity and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. If the relevant act granted an insolvency creditor, or enabled an insolvency creditor to obtain, security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) in a form in which and at a time at which such creditor was entitled to such security or satisfaction (kongruente Deckungshandlung), the words “imminent illiquidity” (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) in the preceding sentence have to be replaced by “actual illiquidity” (eingetretene Zahlungsunfähigkeit). If an insolvency creditor concluded a payment agreement (Zahlungsvereinbarung) with, or granted other forms of deferred payment terms (Zahlungserleichterung) to, the debtor, there is a rebuttable presumption that the insolvency creditor did not have knowledge of the illiquidity of the debtor at the time of such act. With respect to a “related party,” there is a general presumption that such party had “knowledge.” In relation to corporate entities, the term ‘affiliated party’ includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory board, general partners and shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other persons that are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons. Any amounts obtained from transactions that have been challenged would have to be repaid to the insolvency estate. The COVInsAG, however, provides for a privileged treatment of any kind of newly granted third-party financing (i.e., not only traditional cash loans but also commercial credits and other forms of financing) and shareholder loans under German insolvency law avoidance provisions. Thus, the repayment (including reasonable interest payments) of third-party financing and shareholder loans by September 30, 2023 shall not be considered disadvantageous to creditors if the relevant financing is granted between March 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020 472 ----- and the debtor fulfilled the requirements for the suspension of the filing duties. This privilege also includes the provision of collateral in favor of third-party financing providers, but does not apply in case of the provision of collateral in favor of a shareholder loan or receivables from economically similar acts. Furthermore, even in the absence of an insolvency proceeding, a third party creditor who has obtained an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) but has failed to obtain satisfaction of its enforceable claims by a levy of execution, under certain circumstances, has the right to void certain transactions, such as the payment of debt and the granting of security pursuant to the German Avoidance Act (Anfechtungsgesetz). The conditions for avoidance under the German Avoidance Act differ to a certain extent from the above described rules under the German Insolvency Code and the avoidance periods are calculated from the date when a creditor exercises its rights of avoidance in the courts. The German restructuring laws may be subject to further amendments in near future. On June 20, 2019, the Directive (EU) 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency) (the “Restructuring Directive”) has been adopted. The Restructuring Directive was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on June 26, 2019, and the member states have approximately two years to transpose the substantive parts of the Restructuring Directive into their national legislation, although a one year extension can be granted. The Restructuring Directive aims to put in place key principles for all member states on effective preventive restructuring and second chance frameworks, and measures to make all types of insolvency procedures more efficient by reducing their length and associated costs and improving their quality. The key feature of the Restructuring Directive is the introduction of a preventive restructuring framework. The Restructuring Directive sets out minimum EU standards to be applied by the member states (i.e., minimum harmonization). Whereas certain features of the Restructuring Directive need to be transposed into national legislation, the Restructuring Directive leaves a large degree of discretion regarding the implementation of certain other features. Most notably, the Restructuring Directive provides for a framework pursuant to which claims of the relevant creditors may be modified in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not more than 75% of the amount of claims in each class and where applicable a majority by numbers and against the voting of a single creditor in a pre-insolvency restructuring procedure, i.e. outside formal insolvency proceedings. The Restructuring Directive also provides for cross class cram down, i.e. even if the creditors of one class voting on the restructuring plan did not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority, the restructuring plan might still be adopted and take effect for the dissenting creditors. Further, the Restructuring Directive provides for a stay on enforcement, which needs to be transposed into national legislation. The implementation of the Restructuring Directive into national legislation might also include priority ranking for new financing. _Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims_ The insolvency estate shall serve to satisfy the liquidated claims held by the personal creditors against the debtor on the date when the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims shall be satisfied ranking below the other claims of insolvency creditors in the order given below, and according to the proportion of their amounts if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the claims of the insolvency creditors from the day of the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by individual insolvency creditors due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal consequences of a criminal or administrative offence binding the debtor to pay money; (iv) claims to the debtor’s gratuitous performance of a consideration; and (v) claims for restitution of a shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims resulting from legal transactions corresponding in economic terms to such a loan. The CovInsAG, however, suspends the statutory subordination of shareholder loans and receivables from economically similar acts in insolvency proceedings applied for up until September 30, 2023 for newly granted shareholder loans granted between March 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020 and where the debtor fulfilled the requirements for the suspension of the filing duties.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655
291_2,Offering 2020.md,61,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR NOTES,61.67,Canada,61.67.1,Guarantees,"Under federal Canadian corporate law, there are no financial assistance rules that would restrict the giving of upstream guarantees by corporations or limited partnerships. Under Ontario law (and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein), a guarantee or some of its provisions may be unenforceable against the guarantor if they constitute (i) a penalty or (ii) a breach of statute or public policy (e.g., a clause providing for a rate of interest exceeding the statutory ceiling under the Canadian Criminal Code would be illegal). A guarantee may also be unenforceable if the underlying guaranteed obligation has been changed without the consent of the principal debtor or is unenforceable against the principal debtor. The latter result may be avoided if the guarantee also includes appropriate language that causes it to be properly characterized as an indemnity in that an indemnity remains enforceable notwithstanding any invalidity or defect in the underlying obligation unless it would be contrary to public policy to provide indemnification for the underlying obligation. However, there can be no assurance that an agreement characterized by the parties as an indemnity will not be recharacterized as a guarantee by the court. While a guarantee may also provide that a guarantor will be liable as principal debtor for any amount not recoverable on the basis of a guarantee, the enforceability or effect of such a clause is questionable and in certain circumstances such a clause may provide the guarantor with an additional defense to enforcement. Guarantees typically contain waivers of defenses available to the guarantor as a matter of law. Broad, non-specific waivers of any defenses that may be available to guarantors may be unenforceable if the court finds that they are too vague or uncertain. The giving of a guarantee by a federal Canadian corporation may also be subject to an oppression claim at corporate law.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655
291_2,Offering 2020.md,61,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR NOTES,61.67,Canada,61.67.2,Preferences and Transfers at Undervalue,"In the context of certain proceedings, a trustee in bankruptcy, monitor or proposal trustee is required to review asset transfers and transactions undertaken by the bankrupt or insolvent debtor within specified time periods prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings to determine if the debtor was engaged in any preferential transactions or transfers at undervalue. In the case of “transfers at under value,” the review period is one year (or five years for parties not dealing at arm’s length) and preferences are subject to review if they occurred within three months (or twelve months for parties not dealing at arm’s length). A Note Guarantee could be voided as a preference or transfer at undervalue if (1) the applicable Guarantor issued the applicable Note Guarantee with the intent of defeating, delaying or defrauding creditors or with a view to giving the creditor a preference, or (2) the Guarantor was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the applicable Note Guarantee, and (3) in the case of a transfer at undervalue only, the applicable Guarantor did not receive any consideration for issuing the applicable Note Guarantee or if the consideration received by the issuer of the Note Guarantee was conspicuously less than the fair market value of the consideration given by the applicable Guarantor. If a court were to find that the issuance of a Note Guarantee was a preference or transfer at undervalue, the court could void the payment obligations under such Note Guarantee or subordinate such Note Guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of the applicable Guarantor, or require the holders of the Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to such Note Guarantee. In the event of a finding that a preference or transfer at undervalue occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the Notes. We cannot be certain that the issuance of the Note Guarantees would not be subordinated to any of the Guarantors’ other debt or determined by a court to be void.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655
291_2,Offering 2020.md,61,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR NOTES,61.67,Canada,61.67.3,Insolvency,"In Canada, insolvency proceedings are governed principally by two federal statutes (with a third applying mainly to federal financial institutions). The federal insolvency laws in Canada apply across the country and allow for either a liquidation type proceeding (i.e., a chapter 7 type liquidation) or a restructuring type proceeding (i.e., a chapter 11 type proceeding). In addition, under federal insolvency laws, secured creditors may appoint what is known as a “receiver” over the collateral of the debtor, in order to sell the debtor’s assets or manage the debtor’s business or otherwise realize on collateral. In addition, secured creditors may have recourse to self-help or court supervised proceedings. Notwithstanding that insolvency proceedings in Canada are governed by federal statute, in certain circumstances provincial and territorial laws will affect the conduct and/or outcome of those proceedings (e.g., security laws, landlord rights, etc.). The rights of the Trustee who represents the holders of the Notes to enforce remedies could be delayed by the restructuring provisions of applicable Canadian federal bankruptcy, insolvency and other restructuring legislation if the benefit of such legislation is sought with respect to any Guarantors with sufficient nexus to Canada. The 474 ----- powers of the court under the federal insolvency statutes have been interpreted and exercised broadly so as to protect a restructuring entity from actions taken by creditors and other parties. Accordingly, we cannot predict whether payments under the Notes or the Note Guarantees would be made during any bankruptcy, insolvency or other restructuring proceedings, whether or when the Trustee could exercise its rights under the Note Guarantees or whether and to what extent holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delays in payment, if any, of principal, interest and costs, including the fees and disbursements of the Trustee.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655
291_2,Offering 2020.md,61,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR NOTES,61.67,Canada,61.67.4,Liquidation,"Bankruptcy proceedings in Canada can be either voluntarily commenced by a debtor or commenced involuntarily against the debtor by any creditor of such debtor with an unsecured claim of C$1,000 or more. In order for an involuntary bankruptcy filing to be valid, the debtor must have committed one of the acts of bankruptcy set out in the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (the “BIA”), with the most common act of bankruptcy being the inability or failure to meet obligations generally as they become due. Upon a bankruptcy occurring, all of the assets of the bankrupt vest in a trustee in bankruptcy, with the proceedings being subject to the oversight of both the Superintendent of Bankruptcy and the relevant court. Typically, a trustee in bankruptcy proceeds to liquidate the assets of the bankrupt and distribute the proceeds to creditors in accordance with their legal priorities. The BIA and certain other federal and provincial statutes in Canada provide super priority status to claims such as payroll deductions for employee income taxes, government operated pension plans and employment insurance, as well as for certain specified private pension contributions (if any), unpaid wages and employee disbursements (accrued in the six months prior to the bankruptcy, up to C$2,000 for wages and C$1,000 for disbursements, per employee) and, in some circumstances, collected and unremitted Goods and Services Tax and Harmonized Sales Tax. After the statutory super priority claims are paid, the BIA provides that secured creditors are to be paid prior to unsecured creditors. While the general rule is that unsecured creditors share any remaining proceeds pari passu, the BIA does provide that certain “preferred” claims are to be paid prior to the general body of unsecured creditors, including the fees and expenses of the trustee and its counsel, remaining unpaid wages accrued in the six months prior to the bankruptcy beyond the priority amounts noted above and certain landlord claims. Upon the occurrence of a bankruptcy order or a voluntary assignment in bankruptcy, the BIA imposes a stay of proceedings and leave is required to proceed, or continue, with any actions against the bankrupt entity. The stay of proceedings does not apply to secured creditors. Secured creditors are free to continue to enforce their security against the assets of the bankrupt, subject to satisfying the trustee that they have valid and perfected security over the same. As stated above, a secured creditor may appoint a “receiver” or “receiver-manager” over the assets of a debtor. The receiver is not typically appointed to restructure a business. A receivership is intended as a mechanism for realizing on collateral through a liquidation or a going-concern sale. The receiver will proceed to sell the debtor’s assets, manage the debtor’s business or otherwise realize on the collateral, with the proceeds from its activities payable in accordance with the established priorities. A receiver can be court-appointed or privately appointed— the advantages and disadvantages of each vary. In the case of a court-appointed receivership, the powers of the receiver are in the discretion of the court. The appointment order typically includes a stay of proceedings and priority charges for the receiver’s fees and costs. In the case of a private receiver, the receiver’s powers are prescribed by contract (i.e., between the creditor and the debtor). In each case, the receivership remains subject to many of the considerations in a bankruptcy, including super-priorities, reporting obligations, etc. although certain priorities will be different where no bankruptcy is involved. A receiver is often appointed where only the secured creditors are likely to be paid out of the realizations or there is an opportunity to realize higher returns through a going-concern sale of the business than a piecemeal liquidation. Ultimately, however, the effect is the same: the realization on the debtor’s assets in favor of those creditors legally entitled to the proceeds.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655
291_2,Offering 2020.md,61,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR NOTES,61.67,Canada,61.67.5,Restructuring,"Generally, restructuring proceedings are commenced under one of two statutes in Canada. For large or complex restructurings, the most commonly used statute is the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (the “CCAA”). In order to seek relief under the CCAA, the debtor must have at least C$5 million in outstanding claims against it. The granting of an order for relief under the CCAA is in the discretion of the court, but if granted, a CCAA order typically involves a broad stay of proceedings (applying to secured and unsecured creditors), protection from the termination of contracts by third parties, authority to disclaim or repudiate unfavorable contracts and, in certain cases, the granting of super-priority security interests or charges on the assets of the applicant debtor company to secure amounts owing to debtor-in-possession lenders, professionals involved in the restructuring, directors of the company with respect to their statutory liabilities and sometimes others. An initial stay of proceedings under 475 ----- the CCAA cannot exceed 10 days, but the applicant debtor company is entitled to seek extensions to the stay. There is no time limit on the duration of an extension to the stay of proceedings under the CCAA or on the duration of the entirety of the proceeding itself. CCAA proceedings are supervised by the court and upon the making of an order under the CCAA, the court must appoint a licensed trustee in bankruptcy to act as the “monitor” of the applicant company. The monitor is given certain powers under the CCAA and additional powers may be granted by court order. The monitor does not take possession of, or have any control over, the assets of the applicant company unless otherwise ordered by the court. The monitor is required to oversee certain filings made by the applicant company and provide its views with respect to same. The monitor also has a statutory duty to advise the court of any material adverse change in the status of the applicant company. Under the CCAA, a company may, inter alia, proceed to file a plan of compromise or arrangement, or seek court approval of a sale of some or all of its assets. In the case of a plan of compromise or arrangement, it is necessary for the applicant company to obtain the requisite level of creditor approval (66 [2]⁄3% in value of the debt and more than 50% in number of the creditors who cast votes in each affected class of creditors) and court approval of the restructuring plan. Secured creditors may be included in the plan, in which case they are generally not included in the same class as unsecured creditors, or may be dealt with outside of the plan. Upon requisite creditor and court approvals being obtained, the restructuring plan is binding on all affected creditors whether or not they voted in favor of the plan. CCAA plans may be combined with plans of reorganization or arrangement under Canada’s federal and provincial corporate statutes, allowing Canadian corporate entities to change their share capital, including cancelling existing shares and/or converting existing debt to new shares, in the context of a plan. If the proceeding includes an asset sale, any sale out of the ordinary course is subject to approval of the court (but with no creditor vote) and the court is authorized to make an order transferring assets to a purchaser free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances. During the course of a CCAA proceeding, creditors and contractual counter parties are not entitled to exercise any rights or remedies without leave of the court except for certain statutory exceptions (e.g., proven claims of set-off, termination and enforcement rights under certain types of derivative agreements and certain regulatory investigations). The court may not approve an asset sale or sanction a restructuring plan in the context of a CCAA proceeding unless any existing super priority employee wage claims and pension contribution claims are satisfied or provided for to the satisfaction of the court. Debtors in Canada may also proceed with a restructuring under the proposal provisions of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (as previously defined, the “BIA”). The proposal provisions of the BIA (the “Proposal Provisions”) provide for a process that is generally similar to, but less flexible than, restructuring proceedings under the CCAA. A restructuring under the BIA is typically undertaken where the proposed restructuring is small or relatively simple; or, where the applicant debtor simply does not qualify for the CCAA because its aggregate debt is less than C$5 million. There is no minimum amount of outstanding debt required to use the Proposal Provisions. Upon filing a proposal (or a notice of intention to make a proposal) with the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy, the BIA provides an automatic stay of proceedings. There is no need to apply to the court for the initial stay. The nature and term of the stay varies, depending on whether the debtor commences the proceedings by filing a proposal or by filing a notice of intention to make a proposal. In the context of a proposal, the stay applies to unsecured creditors but will only apply to secured creditors if the proposal includes an offer to secured creditors. Such stay will remain in place until the trustee administering the proposal proceedings is discharged (e.g., the proposal is implemented and the proceedings concluded) or the debtor becomes bankrupt (e.g., via a failed proposal, as discussed below). In the context of a notice of intention to make a proposal, the initial stay is for a period of 30 days, which applies to secured and unsecured creditors. However, if the debtor has not completed its proposal within the initial 30-day period, it may apply to the court for an extension of such period. The Proposal Provisions limit the duration of initial 30-day period and any extensions thereto, to an aggregate of six months from the date of the filing of the notice of intention. Failure to file a proposal within this period will result in a deemed bankruptcy. In the case of any proceedings under the Proposal Provisions, the applicant debtor is protected from the termination of most contracts by third parties. The Proposal Provisions allow for the granting of super priority charges (similar to the CCAA), repudiation or disclaimer of contracts (similar to the CCAA), and the appointment of a proposal trustee (which may have a similar role and powers as a monitor under the CCAA). A proposal is ultimately put to a creditor vote, with secured creditors (if any) voting in a separate class (or classes). In the event that the debtor’s proposal to its creditors is either rejected by any class of unsecured creditors at a meeting held to approve such proposal (same voting thresholds as the CCAA noted above) or by the court when the proposal is put before the court for 476 ----- approval, the debtor is deemed bankrupt. Notably, if a proposal is rejected by a class of secured creditors but accepted by each class of unsecured creditors, the proposal does not automatically fail. The secured class rejecting the proposal is left to pursue private remedies, while the proposal is submitted to the court for approval. The court may not approve an asset sale in the context of proposal proceedings or sanction a proposal unless any existing super priority employee wage claims and pension contribution claims are satisfied or provided for to the satisfaction of the court. In the event of a foreign insolvency proceeding, both the CCAA and the BIA allow a representative, authorized in a foreign proceeding in respect of a debtor, to seek recognition of the foreign insolvency proceeding in Canada. The CCAA and the BIA each provide for a modified version of the UNCITRAL model insolvency law (collectively, the “Recognition Provisions”). The Recognition Provisions allow an authorized representative to apply for recognition of the foreign insolvency proceeding as either a “foreign main proceeding” or a “foreign non-main proceeding.” The determination of the type of proceeding is based upon the centre of main interest (“COMI”) of the debtor. If the court determines that the foreign proceeding is a “foreign main proceeding,” the court must grant a stay of proceedings in Canada and may grant additional relief permitted under the CCAA/ BIA. If the court determines that the foreign proceeding is a “foreign non-main” proceeding, the court may, but is not required to, grant a stay of proceedings in Canada and any other relief permitted under the CCAA/BIA. In the event of a recognition order being granted, certain restrictions are imposed on the debtor, including a restriction on selling assets in Canada unless the court approves such asset sale transaction. In the event that the foreign proceeding results in the approval of a restructuring plan, the Canadian court may grant an order providing that such plan shall have full force and recognition in Canada.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

291_2,Offering 2020.md,61,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR NOTES,61.68,The Netherlands,61.68.1,Dutch Insolvency Law,"Two Post-Closing Guarantors are incorporated in the Netherlands. Any insolvency proceeding concerning the Post-Closing Guarantors would likely be based on Dutch insolvency law under the EU Insolvency Regulation. Under certain circumstances, bankruptcy proceedings may also be opened in the Netherlands in accordance with Dutch law over the assets of companies that are not incorporated under Dutch law. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Dutch insolvency law. There are two primary insolvency regimes under Dutch law: the first, moratorium of payments (surseance van betaling), is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s indebtedness and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern. The second, bankruptcy (faillissement), is primarily designed to liquidate assets and distribute the proceeds of the assets of a debtor to its creditors. Both insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet). In practice, a suspension of payments often results in bankruptcy. A general description of the principles of both insolvency regimes is set out below. _Suspension of Payments_ An application for a moratorium of payments can only be made by the debtor itself, if it foresees that it will be unable to continue to pay its payable debts. Once the request for a moratorium of payments is filed, a court will immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional moratorium and appoint an administrator (bewindvoerder). A meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive moratorium. If a draft composition (ontwerpakkoord) is filed simultaneously with the application for a moratorium of payments, the court can order that the composition will be processed before a decision about a definitive moratorium. If the composition is accepted and subsequently ratified by the court (gehomologeerd), the provisional moratorium ends. The definitive moratorium will generally be granted unless a qualified minority (more than one quarter of the amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more than one third of the number of creditors represented at such creditors’ meeting) of the unsecured non-preferential creditors withholds its consent. The granting of a definitive moratorium can also be withheld if there is a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a moratorium of payments or if there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to satisfy its creditors in the (near) future. The moratorium of payments is only effective with regard to unsecured non-preferential creditors. Unlike Chapter 11 proceedings under U.S. bankruptcy law, during which both secured and unsecured creditors are generally barred from seeking to recover on their claims during a moratorium of payments, under Dutch law secured and preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities) may enforce their rights against assets of the company in moratorium of payments to satisfy their claims as if there were no moratorium of payments. A recovery under Dutch law could, therefore, involve a sale of assets that does not reflect the going 477 ----- concern value of the debtor. However, at the request of an interested party the court can order a “cooling down period” (afkoelingsperiode) for a maximum period of two months (which can be extended by the court once for another period of two months) during which enforcement actions by secured or preferential creditors are barred. Also in a definitive moratorium of payments, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors. A composition will be binding for all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is approved by (i) a simple majority of the number of creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims that are acknowledged and admitted in the moratorium, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Consequently, Dutch insolvency law could preclude or inhibit the ability of the noteholders to effect a restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a holder of Notes in a Dutch moratorium of payments proceeding. Interest payments that fall due after the date on which a moratorium of payments is granted, cannot be claimed in a composition. _Bankruptcy_ Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it has ceased to pay its debts. The bankruptcy can be requested by a creditor of a claim when there is at least one other creditor. At least one of the aforementioned claims (of the bankruptcy requesting creditor or the other creditor) needs to be due and payable. The debtor can also request the application of bankruptcy proceedings itself. During a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding, the assets of a debtor are generally liquidated and the proceeds distributed to the debtor’s creditors in accordance with the respective rank and priority of their claims. The general principle of Dutch insolvency law is the paritas creditorum (principle of equal treatment), which means that all creditors have an equal right to payment and that the proceeds of bankruptcy proceedings shall be distributed in proportion to the size of their respective claims. However, certain creditors (such as secured creditors and tax and social security authorities) will have special rights that take priority over the rights of other creditors. Consequently, Dutch insolvency laws could reduce your potential recovery in a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding. The claim of a creditor may be limited depending on the date the claim becomes due and payable in accordance with its terms. Generally, claims of the noteholders that were not due and payable by their terms on the date of a bankruptcy of the relevant Dutch Guarantor will be accelerated and become due and payable as of that date. Each of these claims will have to be submitted to the bankruptcy receiver (curator) to be verified. “Verification” under Dutch law means that the receiver determines the value of the claim and whether and to what extent it will be admitted in the bankruptcy of the company for the purpose of the distribution of the proceeds. The valuation of claims that otherwise would not have been payable at the time of the bankruptcy proceeding may be based on a net present value analysis. Interest payments that fall due after the date of the bankruptcy cannot be verified. The existence, value and ranking of any claims submitted by the noteholders may be challenged in the Dutch bankruptcy proceeding. Generally, in a creditors’ meeting (verificatievergadering), the bankruptcy receiver, the insolvent debtor and all verified creditors may dispute the verification of claims of other creditors. Creditors whose claims or value thereof are disputed in the creditors’ meeting may be referred to separate court proceedings (renvooiprocedure). These procedures could cause noteholders to recover less than the principal amount of their Notes or less than they could recover in a U.S. liquidation proceeding. Such renvooi proceedings could also cause payments to the noteholders to be delayed compared with holders of undisputed claims. As in moratorium of payments proceedings, in the bankruptcy of a company a composition may be offered to creditors, which shall be binding on unsecured non-preferential creditors if it is approved by (i) a simple majority in number of the creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims that are acknowledged and conditionally admitted, and (ii) subsequently confirmed by the court. The Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet) does not in itself acknowledge the concept of classes of creditors. Remaining proceeds, if any, after satisfaction of the secured and the preferential creditors are distributed among the unsecured non-preferential creditors, who will be satisfied on a pro rata basis. Contractual subordination may to a certain extent be given effect in Dutch insolvency proceedings. The actual effect depends largely on the way such subordination is construed. Secured creditors may enforce their rights against assets of the debtor to satisfy their claims under a Dutch bankruptcy as if there is no bankruptcy. As in moratorium of payments proceedings the supervisory judge (rechtercommissaris) can order a “cooling down period” for a maximum of two months (which can be extended once for another period of two months) during which enforcement actions by secured creditors are barred unless such creditors have obtained leave for enforcement from the supervisory judge. Furthermore, a bankruptcy receiver can force a secured creditor to enforce its security interest within a reasonable period of time, failing which the receiver will be entitled to sell the secured assets, if any, and the secured creditor will have to share in the general costs of the bankruptcy, which can be significant. Excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned 478 ----- to the bankruptcy estate; they may not be set off against an unsecured claim of the secured creditor in the bankruptcy. An exception applies in the case of set off relating to a payment to the pledger, not made during its bankruptcy and if there are no other pledgees or other holders of limited rights other than the pledgee, although a set off prior to bankruptcy may be subject to clawback in the case of fraudulent conveyance or bad faith in obtaining the claim used for set off. Moreover, to the extent that Dutch law applies, a legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having a similar effect) can be challenged in an insolvency proceeding or otherwise and may be nullified by any of its creditors or its trustee in bankruptcy. See below “—Fraudulent Transfer.” Under Dutch law, as soon as a debtor is declared bankrupt, in principle, all pending executions of judgments against such debtor, as well as all attachments on the debtor’s assets (other than with respect to secured creditors and certain other creditors, as described above), will be terminated by operation of law. Simultaneously with the opening of the bankruptcy, a bankruptcy receiver will be appointed. The proceeds resulting from the liquidation of the bankruptcy estate may not be sufficient to satisfy unsecured creditors under the guarantees granted by an insolvent guarantor after the secured and the preferential creditors have been satisfied. In principle, litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically stayed.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655
291_2,Offering 2020.md,61,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR NOTES,61.68,The Netherlands,61.68.2,Limitations on Enforcement,"If a Dutch private limited liability company or public limited liability company grants a guarantee or security interest and that guarantee or security interest is not in the company’s corporate interest, the guarantee or security interest may be nullified by the relevant Dutch company, its bankruptcy receiver (curator) in bankruptcy (faillissement) and its administrator (bewindvoerder) in moratorium of payment proceedings (surseance van _betaling) or otherwise and, as a consequence, not be valid, binding and enforceable against it. In determining_ whether the granting of a guarantee or security interest is in the interest of a Dutch company, Dutch courts would not only consider the text of the objects clause in the articles of association (statuten) of the company but all relevant circumstances, including (i) whether the company irrespective of the wording of the objects clause derives certain commercial benefits from the transaction in respect of which the guarantee or security interest was granted and (ii) the balance between the risk that the company is assuming and the benefit it derives from such transaction. In addition, if it is determined that there are no, or insufficient, commercial benefits from the transactions for the company that grants the guarantee, then such company (and any bankruptcy receiver) may challenge the enforcement of the guarantee or security interest, and it is possible that such challenge would be successful. Such benefit may, according to Dutch case law, consist of an indirect benefit derived by the company as a consequence of the interdependence of such company with the group of companies to which it belongs. In addition, it is relevant whether, as a consequence of the granting of the guarantee or security interest, the continuity of such company would foreseeably be endangered by the granting of such guarantee or security interest. It remains possible that even if such strong financial and commercial interdependence exists, the transaction may be declared void if it appears that the granting of the guarantee or security interest cannot serve the realization of the relevant company’s objects or where it is determined that there is a material imbalance to the disadvantage of the company between the commercial benefit on the one hand and the risks on the other hand. The above also applies with respect to any security interest granted or other legal act entered into by a Dutch company. If Dutch law applies, a guarantee or security governed by Dutch law may be voided by a court, if the document was executed through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress (bedreiging) or mistake (dwaling) of a party to the agreement contained in that document. Payment pursuant to a guarantee or following enforcement or foreclosure of security granted may, regardless of an insolvency situation occurring or not, also be withheld due to unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene omstandigheden), force majeure (niet _toerekenbare tekortkoming) or reasonableness and fairness (redelijkheid en billijkheid). Other impeding factors_ include dissolution (ontbinding) of contract and set off (verrekening). In addition, a guarantee issued by a Dutch company and a security interest provided by a Dutch company may be suspended (schorsen) by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam (Ondernemingskamer _van het Gerechtshof te Amsterdam) on the motion of the holder or holders of 10% or more of the shares in such_ company, as well as on the motion of a trade union and of other entities entitled thereto in the articles of association of the relevant Dutch company. Likewise, the guarantee or security itself may be upheld by the Enterprise Chamber, yet actual payment under it may be suspended or avoided. According to Dutch case law, a director (bestuurder) of a company acts wrongfully against a creditor of the company if he has entered into commitments on behalf of that company, while he knew or reasonably ought to 479 ----- understand that the company would not, or not within a reasonable period of time, be able to meet its obligations and would not provide sufficient opportunity for recourse for the detriment that the creditor would suffer on the basis thereof. The foregoing is subject to any circumstances raised by the director on the basis of which the conclusion is justified that he personally cannot be blamed sufficiently (voldoende ernstig verwijt) for the detriment suffered.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655
291_2,Offering 2020.md,61,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR NOTES,61.68,The Netherlands,61.68.3,Fraudulent Transfer,"To the extent that Dutch law applies, a guarantee or security interest granted by a legal entity may, under certain circumstances, be nullified by any of its creditors, if (i) the guarantee or security interest was granted without prior existing legal obligation to do so (onverplicht), (ii) the creditor(s) concerned was/were prejudiced as a consequence of the guarantee or the granting of the security interest and (iii) at the time the guarantee or security interest was granted both the legal entity and, unless the guarantee or security interest was granted for no consideration (om niet), the beneficiary of the guarantee or security interest knew or should have known that one or more of the entities’ creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced (actio pauliana). Also to the extent that Dutch insolvency law applies, a guarantee or security interest may be nullified by the bankruptcy receiver (curator) on behalf of and for the benefit of all creditors of the insolvent debtor, and in such case the beneficiary of the guarantee or security interest is presumed (subject to evidence to the contrary) to have known that creditors of the debtor would be prejudiced if the bankruptcy follows within a year of the granting and for no consideration. The foregoing requirements for invoking fraudulent transfer outside of a bankruptcy apply mutatis _mutandis when invoking fraudulent transfer provisions during a bankruptcy. In addition, the bankruptcy receiver_ may challenge the guarantee or security interest if it was granted on the basis of a prior existing legal obligation to do so (verplichte rechtshandeling), if (i) the guarantee or security interest was granted at a time that the beneficiary of such guarantee or security interest knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed or (ii) if such guarantee or security interest was granted as a result of deliberation between the debtor and the beneficiary of such guarantee or security interest with a view to give preference to the beneficiary over the debtor’s other creditors. Consequently, the validity of any guarantees or security interests granted by a Dutch legal entity may be challenged and it is possible that such challenge would be successful. It is not certain and has not been determined in published case law whether a right of pledge on shares can be created in advance of the acquisition of the shares by the pledger. If a security right is created on collateral to which a Dutch company has not yet obtained a legally valid title, such collateral will not be subject to such a security interest if that company is declared bankrupt or granted a moratorium of payments prior to obtaining title thereto. It is not possible to conduct searches in respect of any Dutch law governed security (other than, if created, in respect of rights of mortgage), with the exception of any pledge created on the shares in a Dutch private limited liability company which should be registered in its shareholders’ register. However, this does not constitute conclusive evidence of the absence of any preexisting security. 480 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of such ERISA Plan. When considering an investment in the Notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Laws relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan, including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws. No representation is made that the sale of any Notes to a Plan meets the fiduciary requirements for investments by Plans generally or any particular Plan or that such an investment is appropriate for Plans generally or any particular Plan. None of the Issuers, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers nor any of the parties described in this offering memorandum, or their respective affiliates, is providing any advice or recommendation to any Plan, including, without limitation, in a fiduciary capacity, through this offering memorandum or otherwise, in connection with the sale of the Notes.

A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. Plans that are not subject to the requirements of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code may be subject to similar provisions under applicable Similar Laws. The acquisition and/or holding of Notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which the Issuers, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers are considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the Department of Labor (the “DOL”) has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the Notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. Further, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code may also provide exemptive relief; provided that neither the Issuers nor the any of their affiliates has or exercises any discretionary authority or control or renders any investment advice with respect to the assets of any ERISA Plan involved in the acquisition or holding of the Notes 484 ----- and; provided further that the ERISA Plan receives no less, and pays no more, than “adequate compensation” (within the meaning of Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(f)(10) of the Code) in connection with such acquisition and holding. Under the Plan Asset Regulations, the assets of the Issuers would be treated as Plan Assets of an ERISA Plan if the ERISA Plan acquires an equity interest in the Issuers and none of the exceptions contained in the Plan Asset Regulations is applicable. If the underlying assets of the Issuers are deemed to be Plan Assets, the obligations and other responsibilities of sponsors, fiduciaries and plan administrators of the ERISA Plans, and of parties in interest and disqualified persons (as defined under ERISA and the Code), under Parts 1 and 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, as applicable, may be expanded, and there may be an increase in their liability under these and other provisions of ERISA and the Code (except to the extent (if any) that a favorable statutory or administrative exemption or exception applies). An “equity interest” is defined under the Plan Asset Regulations as an interest in an entity other than an instrument which is treated as indebtedness under applicable local law and which has no substantial equity features. Although there is little guidance on the subject and no assurance can be given, at the time of their issuance, the Notes may not be treated as equity interests of the Issuers for purposes of the Plan Asset Regulation. That determination is based, in part, upon the traditional debt features of the Notes, including the reasonable expectation of purchasers of such Notes that such Notes will be repaid when due, as well as the absence of conversion rights, warrants and other typical equity features. The Notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing the assets of any Plan, unless such purchase and holding will be exempt from the prohibited transaction restrictions contained in or would not result in a violation of any applicable Similar Laws. By acceptance of a Note or any interest therein, each Purchaser and transferee of Notes (or any interest therein) will be deemed to have represented, warranted and agreed, among other things, that either (a) it is not, and for so long as it holds any Notes (or interest therein) it will not be, a Plan and no portion of the assets used by such Purchaser or transferee to acquire and hold the Notes or an interest therein constitutes assets of any Plan; or (b) the purchase and holding of the Notes or an interest therein by such Purchaser or transferee does not and will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation of any applicable Similar Laws.

Purchasers and transferees of the Notes have exclusive responsibility for ensuring that their purchase and holding of the Notes does not violate the fiduciary or prohibited transaction rules of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Laws.

Most of our directors and executive officers live outside the United States. A substantial portion of our assets and the assets of our directors and executive officers are located outside the United States. As a result, although we have appointed an agent for service of process under the Indentures governing the Notes, it may be difficult for you to serve process on those persons or us in the United States or to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against them or us based on civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States. There is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil liabilities based on federal or state securities laws of the United States, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. federal or state courts. The United States and the Federal Republic of Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. The enforceability of final judgments therefore may depend on the laws of the relevant U.S. state and federal laws of the United States. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by any federal or state court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Germany. A final judgment by a U.S. federal or state court, however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German court generally will not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted below. German courts will, in particular, not recognize and enforce such judgments if the judgment is not final under applicable U.S. federal or state law or if any of the reasons for excluding enforceability set forth in section 328(1) of the German Code of Civil Procedure exist: - if, pursuant to German law, the U.S. federal or state court having rendered the foreign judgment did not have jurisdiction; - if process has not been duly served or has not been served in a timely fashion to permit a defense, provided that the defendant did not actively participate in such process and pleads accordingly; - if the judgment is incompatible with a prior judgment rendered by a German court or by a foreign court which is to be recognized in Germany; - if the judgment, or the proceeding resulting in the judgment, to be recognized is incompatible with a proceeding in Germany which was pending (rechtshängig) before a German court before the U.S. federal or state court entered its judgment; - if a recognition of the judgment would be obviously incompatible with essential principles of German law, in particular, if the recognition would be incompatible with the civil rights (Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz); and - if reciprocity is not ensured (i.e., the U.S. federal or state courts would not recognize and enforce a comparable judgment by a German court in equivalent circumstances). Subject to the foregoing, holders of the Notes may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts in Germany. There is some German case law to the effect that reciprocity of the recognition of judgments is ensured in relation to claims relating to assets (vermögensrechtliche Ansprüche) with regard to various U.S. states. We cannot, however, assure you that attempts to enforce judgments in Germany will be successful. It is also doubtful whether a German court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action solely predicated by U.S. federal securities laws. In addition, the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages are usually denied by German courts as incompatible with the essential principles of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. Consequently, judgments awarding monetary damages under civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws may not be enforceable to the extent they provide for a compensation that would qualify as being of a penal or punitive nature. 489 ----- German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. In so far as the production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provided for pretrial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and/or the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this matter may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pretrial discovery process exists under German law. In addition, it may under certain circumstances also not be possible for investors to effect service of process within Germany upon the German Notes Guarantors or those persons under the Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 and the German law implementing such convention if such service were deemed to infringe German sovereignty or security, which may be the case if such service violated the fundamental principles of German law, in particular the civil rights (Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz). However, the German Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) held in 2013 that service may not be denied solely because the action before the U.S. court contains claims for punitive damages.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

However, under the laws of the Province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein therein (“Ontario Law”), a court of competent jurisdiction in Ontario (a “Canadian Court”) would give a judgment based upon on a final and conclusive in personam judgment of a court exercising jurisdiction in the State of New York (a “New York Court”) for a sum certain, obtained against the Guarantors with respect to a claim arising out of the Note Guarantees (a “New York Judgment”), without reconsideration of the merits, provided that: (a) the New York Court rendering such judgment had jurisdiction over the Guarantors, as recognized by Ontario Law (and submission by each Issuer and each Guarantor in connection with the Note Guarantees to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the New York Court will be sufficient for that purpose); (b) an action to enforce the New York Judgment must be commenced in the Canadian Court within any applicable limitation period; (c) the Canadian Court has discretion to stay or decline to hear an action on the New York Judgment if the New York Judgment is under appeal or there is another subsisting judgment in any jurisdiction relating to the same cause of action as the New York Judgment; (d) under the Currency Act (Canada), the Canadian Court may only render judgment for a sum of money in Canadian dollars, and in enforcing a foreign judgment for a sum of money in a foreign currency, a Canadian Court will render its decision in the Canadian dollar equivalent of such foreign currency; (e) an action in the Canadian Court on the New York Judgment may be affected by bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally; and (f) such enforcement would be subject to the following defenses: (i) the New York Judgment was obtained by fraud or in a manner contrary to the principles of natural justice, provided that the New York Judgment would not be contrary to natural justice by reason only that service of process was effected on the agent for service of process appointed by the Guarantors pursuant to the Note Guarantees; (ii) the New York Judgment is for a claim which under Ontario Law would be characterized as based on a foreign revenue, expropriatory, penal or other public law; (iii) the New York Judgment is contrary to public policy under Ontario Law or to an order made by the Attorney General of Canada under the Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act (Canada) or by the Competition Tribunal under the Competition Act (Canada) in respect of certain judgments referred to in these statutes; and (iv) the New York Judgment has been satisfied or is void or voidable under the laws of the State of New York. 490 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

As a result, it may be difficult for investors to enforce judgments obtained in non-Dutch courts against the Dutch Guarantors. The Netherlands does not currently have a treaty with the United States providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any court in any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon United States federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in the Netherlands. In order to obtain a judgment which is enforceable in the Netherlands, the claim must be re-litigated before a competent Dutch court. Under current practice, the courts of the Netherlands may be expected to render a judgment in accordance with the judgment of the relevant U.S. court, provided that such judgment (i) is a final judgment and has been rendered by a court which has established its jurisdiction vis-à-vis the Dutch Guarantors on the basis of internationally accepted grounds of jurisdiction, (ii) was rendered in after proper service of process and using proper judicial procedure (behoorlijke rechtspleging), (iii) is not contrary to the public policy (openbare orde) of the Netherlands, (iv) is not incompatible with (a) a prior judgment of a Dutch court rendered in a dispute between the same parties, or (b) a prior judgment of a non-Dutch court rendered in a dispute between the same parties, concerning the same subject matter and based on the same cause of action, provided that such prior judgment is capable of being recognized in the Netherlands and (v) the judgment is—according to the law of its country of origin— formally capable of being enforced (e.g. is readily enforceable, has not been annulled in appeal or its enforceability has not been subject to a certain time frame). Subject to the foregoing and service of process in accordance with applicable treaties, investors may be able to enforce in the Netherlands judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, no assurance can be given that those judgments will be enforceable. In addition, it is doubtful whether a Dutch court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action commenced in the Netherlands and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. Any enforcement of agreements governed by foreign law and any foreign judgments in the Netherlands will be subject to the rules of Dutch civil procedure. Judgments may be rendered in a foreign currency but enforcement is executed in EUR at the applicable rate of exchange. Enforcement of obligations in the Netherlands will be subject to the nature of the remedies available in the courts of the Netherlands. The taking of concurrent proceedings in more than one jurisdiction may be disallowed by the courts of the Netherlands, but such courts have the power to stay proceedings (aanhouden) if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere. Dutch courts may deny the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages or other awards. Moreover, a Dutch court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. Enforcement and recognition of judgments of U.S. courts in the Netherlands are solely governed by the provisions of the Dutch Civil Procedure Code (Wetboek van _Burgerlijke Rechtsvordering)._ Enforcement of obligations before a Dutch court will be subject to the degree to which the relevant obligations are enforceable under their governing law, to the nature of the remedies available in Dutch courts, the acceptance by such courts of jurisdiction, the effect of provisions imposing prescription periods and to the availability of defenses such as set off (unless validly waived) and counter-claim; specific performance may not always be awarded. 491 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,655
291_2,Offering 2020.md,25,PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION,25.4,,25.4.1,,"The Issuers have agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase from the Issuers, the entire principal amount of the Notes. The sale of the Notes will be made pursuant to a purchase agreement among the Issuers and the Initial Purchasers to be dated the date of the final offering memorandum (the “Purchase Agreement”). The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to purchase the Notes from the Issuers, are several and not joint. The Purchase Agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers will purchase all the Notes if they purchase any of them. The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the issue price that appears on the cover of this offering memorandum. After the initial Offering, the Initial Purchasers may change the price at which the Notes are offered and any other selling terms at any time without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell the Notes through certain of their affiliates, including in respect of sales into the United States. To the extent that any Initial Purchaser that is not a U.S. registered broker dealer intends to effect any sales of the Notes in the United States, it will do so through one or more U.S. registered broker dealer affiliates as permitted by guidelines promulgated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and to reject orders in whole or in part. Persons who purchase the Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price set forth on the cover page hereof. The Issuers have agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their services in connection with this Offering and to reimburse them for certain out of pocket expenses. The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel. The Purchase Agreement also provides that, if an Initial Purchaser defaults, the purchase commitments of the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers may be increased or, in some cases, the Offering may be terminated. The Purchase Agreement provides that the Issuers and each of the Guarantors will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. We have agreed not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided under the Purchase Agreement, any debt securities of, or guaranteed by, the Issuers and the Guarantors or any of their subsidiaries that are substantially similar to the Notes during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the date falling 45 days after the closing of the Offering without the prior written consent of Goldman Sachs International, Barclays and Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited. The Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within the United States except to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A and to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Until 40 days after the later of (i) the commencement of the Offering and (ii) the Issue Date of the Notes, an offer or sale of the Notes initially sold in reliance on Regulation S within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Notice to Certain _Investors” and “Transfer Restrictions.”_ Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it: - has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuers or any Guarantor; and - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom. No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by us or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this 486 ----- offering memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the offering of the Notes, the distribution of this offering memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.” The Issuers have also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act or the safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes. The Issuers will apply, through their Listing Agent, for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange; however, the Issuers cannot assure you that such listing will be obtained or, if obtained, maintained. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “U.S. Exchange Act”). Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating _Each Series of Notes—Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes.”_ The Initial Purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the U.S. Exchange Act. Over allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchaser. Stabilizing transactions permit the Initial Purchasers to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. In connection with the offering, the Stabilizing Managers, or a person acting on their behalf, may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the Stabilizing Managers may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Managers may also over-allot the Offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilizing Managers may bid for and purchase Notes in market making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Managers is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Each _Series of Notes—Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes.”_ These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the offering of the Notes is made and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers. If these activities are commenced, they must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the date of issuance of the Notes and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. These transactions may be effected in the over the counter market or otherwise. Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two Business Days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6 1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on or about the date specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be business days following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+ “). Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade such Notes on the date of this offering memorandum or the next 487 ----- succeeding Business Days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past, are currently providing, or may in the future provide, investment banking, financial advisory, commercial banking, various lending, hedging, guarantee or other banking or budgeting services to us and our affiliates under bilateral agreements or local facilities in the ordinary course of business, for which they have received or may receive customary fees and commissions. The Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may also receive allocations of the Notes. In addition, the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates will act as mandated lead arrangers and original lenders, as applicable under the Senior Facilities Agreement, which we will enter into as borrowers and draw to provide financing for the Acquisition. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may act as counterparties in hedging arrangements. In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers or certain of their affiliates, including UBS Europe SE, advised the Sponsors on the Acquisition. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have provided a bridge facility that will be cancelled on the Issue Date. In connection with their services in such capacities, the Initial Purchasers have received, or will receive, customary fees. In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and instruments of ours or our affiliates. If the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, they routinely hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and short positions in such securities and instruments. 488 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

As part of this new strategy, the Executive Board proposed an initial public offering (hereafter “IPO”) of thyssenkrupp Elevator Technology Business (hereafter “Elevator Technology Business”) to the Supervisory Board. In addition to the IPO thyssenkrupp AG was also contemplating a full trade sale of the Elevator Technology Business to potential interested parties. On February 27, 2020, the Executive Board’s decision to sell its entire Elevator Technology Business to a consortium led by Advent, Cinven and RAG foundation (hereafter “the transaction”) was approved by the Supervisory Board of thyssenkrupp AG. The closing of this transaction is expected by the end of the current fiscal year. thyssenkrupp AG will reinvest part of the purchase price in a stake in the Elevator Technology Business. The thyssenkrupp Elevator Technology Group (hereafter “thyssenkrupp ET Group”)—which designs and delivers passenger transportation solutions—has been separated from thyssenkrupp AG and its subsidiaries (hereafter “thyssenkrupp Group”). In an initial preparatory step, the thyssenkrupp ET Group operating activities that had previously not been operating as separate companies were transferred to separate legal entities. In a second step, all companies making up the thyssenkrupp ET Group were transferred to wholly-owned subsidiaries of thyssenkrupp AG, i.e. thyssenkrupp Elevator International Holding B.V., Roermond, Netherlands or to thyssenkrupp Elevator Innovation and Operations AG, Düsseldorf, Germany, which was previously named thyssenkrupp Elevator AG until December 10, 2019. On June 2, 2020 thyssenkrupp Elevator Innovation and Operations AG changed its legal form to thyssenkrupp Elevator Innovations and Operations GmbH (hereafter “thyssenkrupp Elevator laO[1]”). In further steps, thyssenkrupp Elevator International Holding B.V. and its subsidiaries and the thyssenkrupp Elevator laO and its subsidiaries were then transferred at December 6, 2019 and at December 31, 2019, respectively, to a new company named thyssenkrupp Elevator Holding GmbH, Essen, Germany (formerly thyssenkrupp Industrials GmbH, Essen, Germany, that was founded in June 2018 under the name thyssenkrupp Carbon2Chem Management GmbH, Duisburg, Germany). As of December 31, 2019, both companies are therefore 100%-subsidiaries of thyssenkrupp Elevator Holding GmbH, which is the parent company of the thyssenkrupp ET Group. On January 16, 2020, name and legal form of the thyssenkrupp Elevator Holding GmbH was changed to thyssenkrupp Elevator AG (hereafter “the Company[2]”). The transferred Elevator Technology Business operations are comprised of legal entities as well as assets and liabilities that have been transferred to the Company with effect from December 31, 2019, as part of the legal reorganization that in accordance with IFRS 10.B97 “Consolidated Financial Statements” are deemed linked transactions. This reorganization is a transaction under common control, since all transferred legal entities as well as assets and liabilities are ultimately controlled by thyssenkrupp AG. Up to and until December 31, 2019, the date of the completion of the legal reorganization, there was no obligation for the Company to prepare consolidated financial statements for the thyssenkrupp ET Group because the Elevator Technology Business was not a group of entities under control of a parent as defined by IFRS 10 “Consolidated Financial Statements” and has historically not prepared consolidated financial statements for internal or external reporting purpose. Combined financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as applicable in the European Union were prepared for the Elevator Technology Business as of and for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The combined annual financial statements are hereinafter referred to as the “Combined Financial Statements”. The Combined Financial Statements of the Elevator Technology Business reflect the Elevator Technology Business as historically included in the IFRS consolidated financial statements of thyssenkrupp AG under application of the predecessor accounting (book value) approach in accordance with established practice in accounting for business combinations under common control under IFRS. These Combined Financial Statements are expected to be published for the purpose of a bond offering in June 2020. 1 Until December 10, 2019, thyssenkrupp Elevator IaO refers to thyssenkrupp Elevator AG. Subsequent to December 10, 2019 until June 2, 2020, thyssenkrupp Elevator IaO refers to thyssenkrupp Elevator Innovation and Operations AG. Starting on June 2, 2020, thyssenkrupp Elevator IaO refers to thyssenkrupp Elevator Innovation and Operations GmbH. 2 Until January 16, 2020, the Company refers to thyssenkrupp Elevator Holding GmbH.

For purposes of the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements the above noted transactions of the legal reorganization have been accounted for as common control transactions by applying predecessor accounting (book value) in accordance with recognized industry practice for business combinations under common control[3].

This Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with these Combined Financial Statements. The Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared on [•], 2020 by the Executive Board of the Company. - **Basis of preparation of the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements In addition, holding companies such as thyssenkrupp AG have provided various central services including governance to the thyssenkrupp ET Group. These services were historically reported in the thyssenkrupp Group and either were transferred to the thyssenkrupp ET Group as part of the legal reorganization or will be provided as a service under transitional service agreements (hereafter “TSAs”) starting January 1, 2020. As of now, there are TSAs for almost all central services (e.g. IT, HR, Legal) provided by the thyssenkrupp Group. Going forward, it is planned to terminate these existing TSAs and to establish these central services at the thyssenkrupp ET Group. The respective income and costs for such services that were historically recharged to the thyssenkrupp ET Group, have been included in the interim consolidated statement of profit or loss at their historical amounts. Where income and costs for such services in the periods until December 31, 2019 were historically not recharged but were essential to the operational business of the thyssenkrupp ET Group, such income and costs were either directly attributed or, where this was not possible, allocated using appropriate allocation keys and are reflected in the interim consolidated statements of profit or loss at their historical cost. Furthermore, assets or liabilities relating to administrative services, service companies or the central activities of the holding companies pertained to the thyssenkrupp ET Group were attributed in the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements based on the legal reorganization principle. Shared assets relating to such holding companies that did not legally transfer to the thyssenkrupp ET Group were not included in the interim consolidated statements of financial position of the Company. However, for such an appropriate usage charge was reflected in the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements in the reporting periods until December 31, 2019. Shared assets relating to such holding companies that did legally transfer to the thyssenkrupp ET Group, were included in the interim consolidated statements of financial position of the Company. The usage by the remaining thyssenkrupp Group was accounted for by way of appropriate usage income charges to the remaining thyssenkrupp Group in the reporting periods until December 31, 2019. Administrative services or central activities will be continued after closing of the transaction by TSAs that have been implemented January 01, 2020. Services as part of the TSAs might result in different cost charges compared to the current allocation. For companies or operations that did not constitute a separate tax payer in the historical reporting period (e.g. companies being part of a fiscal unity or asset deal companies) the following particularities apply: - Tax expense and tax income are recognized in the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements in the years in which they arose as contributions or withdrawals by the shareholders immediately settled in equity; - Current losses trigger tax income, if it is probable that sufficient future taxable profit will be available. This tax income is treated as withdrawal by the shareholders in the respective year; - Tax receivables, tax liabilities and deferred tax assets from current losses are not shown in the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements unless the company has own tax loss carryforwards which are legally assessed. In the interim consolidated statements of cash flows, the taxes actually paid to tax authorities as well as current taxes allocated based on the separate tax return approach were included as inflows/outflows from operating activities. Taxes allocated to thyssenkrupp ET Group under the separate tax return approach were deemed immediately settled. Payments made to the remaining thyssenkrupp Group under historical tax group arrangements are also included as inflows/outflows from operating activities. The management of the thyssenkrupp ET Group deems this approach as applied for the comparative period as appropriate but not necessarily indicative of the tax expense or income as well as tax payments that would result for thyssenkrupp ET Group as a separate group. - a decrease/increase in trade accounts receivable of €(8) million as of September 30, 2019 (March 31, 2019: €23 million; October 1, 2018: €24 million), - a decrease in other non-financial assets of €(8) million as of September 30, 2019 (March 31, 2019: €(2) million; October 1, 2018: €(2) million), - an increase in contract assets of €98 million as of September 30, 2019 (March 31, 2019: €10 million; October 1, 2018: €10 million), - a decrease/increase in current income tax assets of €(2) million as of September 30, 2019 (March 31, 2019: €10 million; October 1, 2018: €10 million), - a decrease in total invested equity of €(29) million as of September 30, 2019 (March 31, 2019: €(19) million; October 1, 2018: €(11) million), - a decrease/increase in other provisions (current) of €(12) million as of September 30, 2019 (March 31, 2019: €11 million; October 1, 2018: €10 million), - a decrease/increase in trade accounts payable of €(9) million as of September 30, 2019 (March 31, 2019: €47 million; October 1, 2018: €47 million), - a decrease/increase in other non-financial liabilities of €(2) million as of September 30, 2019 (March 31, 2019: €19 million; October 1, 2018: €12 million), - an increase/decrease in contract liabilities of €108 million as of September 30, 2019 (March 31, 2019: €(41) million; October 1, 2018: €(41) million), - an increase in sales of €1 million in the 1st half year ended March 31, 2019, - a decrease in cost of sales of €(1) million in the 1st half year ended March 31, 2019, - an increase in selling expenses of €4 million in the 1st half year ended March 31, 2019, - an increase in general and administrative expenses of €5 million in the 1st half year ended March 31, 2019, - an increase in other income of €12 million in the 1st half year ended March 31, 2019, - an increase in other expenses of €12 million in the 1st half year ended March 31, 2019, - an increase in financial loss of €1 million in the 1st half year ended March 31, 2019, - a decrease in income taxes of €(1) million in the 1st half year ended March 31, 2019.

Historically recognized expenses for the use of the brand remain within the Combined Financial Statements for the periods up to September 30, 2019. Based on the Executive Board’s decision as of February 27, 2020 to sell the entire Elevator Technology Business the above described new license agreement, entered into on September 30, 2019, was amended in March 2020 via an addendum agreement, since the governance model in the new license agreement was only suitable with an IPO. In substance, the terms and conditions of the addendum agreement lead to a limitation of the initially agreed indefinite useful life. The terms of the addendum agreement become effective subject to the condition precedent of all closing conditions of the transaction being fulfilled and will result in the repayment of the initially agreed fully paid up F-46 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

Since the thyssenkrupp ET Group has a complex financial history and did not constitute a consolidated group with a parent entity for the reporting periods until December 31, 2019, no capital stock, additional paid-in capital retained earnings are presented in the statement of changes in equity for the comparative period. For such periods the equity of the thyssenkrupp ET Group consists of the invested equity attributable to the thyssenkrupp Group, other components of equity and the invested equity attributable to non-controlling interest. Since the thyssenkrupp ET Group had no share capital and reserves in its own right, any equity presented until December 31, 2019 represents the parent’s net investment. Thus, the presentation of the equity for the reporting periods until December 31, 2019 of the thyssenkrupp ET Group differs from the presentation of equity as prescribed in IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements”. During the reporting period under consideration, the thyssenkrupp ET Group was mainly financed by the remaining thyssenkrupp Group.

For the comparative period, income taxes were determined using the separate tax return approach based on the assumption that the companies and operations of the Elevator Technology Business constitute separate tax payers. This assumption implies that current and deferred taxes for all companies (share deal companies) and operations (asset deal companies) within Elevator Technology Business are calculated separately and that the recoverability of deferred tax assets is assessed on this basis. Legal entities and business operating activities are treated for purposes of the separate tax return approach as a tax group if such legal entities and business operations have historically been included in a tax group and as of December 31, 2019 have operated under a new tax group or are still included within the historical tax group. Deferred tax assets resulting from tax loss carryforwards are recognized in the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements to the extent that it is probable that they can be offset against positive results from the respective thyssenkrupp ET Group companies or operations in the future. This is only applicable if the legal entity is part of the thyssenkrupp ET Group and to the extent the legal entity has tax loss carryforwards legally assessed. F-12 ----- Current and deferred income taxes are recognized in accordance with IAS 12 “Income Taxes”. For purposes of the Combined Financial Statements, income taxes were determined using the separate tax return approach based on the assumption that the companies and operations of the Elevator Technology Business constitute separate tax payers. This assumption implies that current and deferred taxes for all companies (share deal companies) and operations (asset deal companies) within Elevator Technology Business are calculated separately and that the recoverability of deferred tax assets is assessed on this basis.

In such cases, the legal entity or business operating activities representing the head of the tax group is considered as the separate tax payer. Deferred tax assets resulting from tax loss carryforwards are recognized in the Combined Financial Statements to the extent that it is probable that they can be offset against positive results from the respective Elevator Technology Business companies or operations in the future. This is only applicable if the legal entity is part of the thyssenkrupp ET Group and to the extent the legal entity has tax loss carryforwards legally assessed. For companies or operations that did not constitute a separate tax payer in the historical reporting period (e.g. companies being part of a fiscal unity or asset deal companies) the following particularities apply: - Tax expense and tax income are recognized in the Combined Financial Statements in the years in which they arose as contributions or withdrawals by the shareholders immediately settled in equity; - Current losses trigger tax income, which is treated as withdrawal by the shareholders in the respective year; - Tax receivables, tax liabilities and deferred tax assets from current losses are not shown in the Combined Financial Statements. US companies being part of a fiscal unity are allowed to utilize its own tax losses after leaving the fiscal unity. Thus, for US companies deferred tax assets on tax loss carryforwards are reflected in the Combined Financial Statements to the extent the tax loss carryforwards can be used in the future. In the combined statements of cash flows, the taxes actually paid to tax authorities as well as current taxes allocated based on the separate tax return approach were included as inflows/outflows from operating activities.

291_2,Offering 2020.md,29,WHERE YOU CAN FIND OTHER INFORMATION,29.65,Adoption of IFRS 16,29.65.1,,"In January 2016, the IASB published the new accounting standard IFRS 16 Leases. The new standard replaces the previous classification of leases into operating and finance leases as a lessee and introduces a uniform accounting model for the lessee. Under the previous standard (IAS 17), lease obligations for operating leases were only to be disclosed in the notes. In accordance with IFRS 16, the rights and obligations resulting from leases must be recognized as a right-of-use of the leased asset and a corresponding lease liability in the lessee’s statement of financial position. This resulted in the following recognition and measurement principles: A contract constitutes a lease if the contract conveys the lessee - the right to control the use of an identified asset (the leased asset) - for a specific period - in exchange for a consideration. Since October 1, 2019, the thyssenkrupp ET Group as a lessee recognizes in general for all leases within the interim consolidated statement of financial position an asset for the right-of-use of the leased assets and a liability for the lease payment commitments at present value. These are primarily rentals of property and buildings, technical machinery and equipment as well as other equipment, factory and office equipment. The right-of-use assets reported under property, plant and equipment are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Payments for non-lease components are not included in the determination of the lease liability. The lease liabilities reported under financial liabilities reflect the present value of the outstanding lease payments at the time the asset is made available for use. Lease payments are discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease if it can be readily determined. Otherwise, they are discounted at the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate. The derivation of the interest rate is based on the assumption that an adequate amount of funds will be raised over an adequate period of time in the amount of an asset comparable to the right-of-use asset, taking into account the economic environment and comparable collateral. The lease liabilities include the following lease payments: - Fixed payments, less lease incentives to be paid by the lessor; F-16 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, which are comprised as follows: - Lease liability; - lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received; - initial direct costs; and - dismantling obligations. Subsequent measurement of the right-of-use asset is performed at amortized cost. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term, unless the useful life of the underlying asset is shorter. If the lease agreement contains reasonably certain purchase options, the right of use is depreciated over the economic life of the underlying asset. In subsequent measurement, the lease liability is compounded, and the corresponding interest expense is recognized in the financial result. The lease payments made reduce the carrying amount of the lease liability. In accordance with the recognition exemptions, low-value leases of and short-term leases (less than twelve months) are recognized in the statement of profit or loss. The thyssenkrupp ET Group has identified certain asset classes (e.g. PCs, telephones, printers, copiers) which regularly contain leased assets of low value. Outside these asset classes, only leased assets with a value of up to USD/€5,000 are classified as low-value leased assets. Furthermore, the new regulations are not applied to leases of intangible assets. For contracts comprising a non-lease component as well as a lease component, each lease component must be accounted for separately from non-lease component as a lease. The lessee must allocate the contractually agreed-upon payment to the separate lease components based on the relative standalone selling price of the lease component and the aggregated standalone selling price of the non-lease components. In addition, intercompany leases will continue to be presented in the segment report according to IFRS 8 as operating leases in accordance with IAS 17. The term of the lease is determined based on the non-cancellable lease term. Especially real estate leases contain extension and termination options. Such contractual conditions offer the greatest possible operational flexibility to the thyssenkrupp ET Group. In determining the lease term, all facts and circumstances are considered that provide an economic incentive to exercise renewal options or not to exercise termination options. Lease term modifications from the exercise or non-exercise of such options are only considered in the lease term if they are reasonably certain and are based on an event that is within the control of the lessee. Use is made of the exemption option to apply IFRS 16 to all agreements that were previously identified as leases by applying IAS 17 and IFRIC 4. The thyssenkrupp ET Group has applied the modified retrospective approach in accordance with IFRS 16.C5(b). In accordance with this approach the comparative prior-year figures do not have to be adjusted and the first-time adoption effects are recognized in the retained earnings as of October 1, 2019. The thyssenkrupp ET Group recognized new assets and liabilities for its operating leases at the date of transition to IFRS 16. When applying the modified retrospective method, right-of-use assets were recognized at the initial recognition date at the carrying amounts of the lease liabilities adjusted for deferred lease payments. The lease liabilities were recognized at the present value of the lease payments outstanding at the date of first-time application, discounted at the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate at the date of first-time application. The thyssenkrupp ET Group made use of exemption options in the transition to IFRS 16 and treated leases with a remaining term of up to twelve months as short-term leases, left initial direct costs unaffected in the initial measurement of the right-of-use asset, and took current knowledge into account in determining the lease terms for agreements with extension and/or termination options. No impairment test in accordance with IAS 36 was carried out at the time of initial application. Instead, leases entered into immediately prior to October 1, 2019, F-17 ----- were assessed in accordance with IAS 37 “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets” to determine whether they were onerous. No onerous contracts were identified. The effects on the thyssenkrupp ET Group’s previous finance leases were insignificant. As of October 1, 2019, right-of-use assets in the amount of €345 million and lease liabilities in the amount of €349 million were recognized as part of the transition to IFRS 16.

Equity and debt instruments are in general measured at fair value, which is based to the extent available on market prices as of the balance sheet date. When no quoted market prices in an active market are available, equity and debt instruments are measured by discounting future cash flows based on current market interest rates over the remaining term of the financial instruments. The fair value of foreign currency forward transactions is determined on the basis of the middle spot exchange rate applicable as of the interim balance sheet date, and taking account of forward premiums or discounts arising for the respective remaining contract term compared to the contracted forward exchange rate. Common methods for calculating option prices are used for foreign currency options. The fair value of an option is influenced not only by the remaining term of an option, but also by other factors, such as current amount and volatility of the underlying exchange or base rate. The carrying amounts of trade accounts payable and other current liabilities equal their fair values. The fair value of fixed rate liabilities equals the present value of expected cash flows.

291_2,Offering 2020.md,29,WHERE YOU CAN FIND OTHER INFORMATION,29.188,Notes to the Combined Financial Statements 01 Basis of preparation •** **General information Background,29.188.1,,"On May 21, 2019, the Supervisory Board of thyssenkrupp Aktiengesellschaft, Duisburg and Essen, Germany (hereafter “thyssenkrupp AG”) unanimously approved the Executive Board’s plans for a fundamental strategic realignment of the group. As part of this new strategy, the Executive Board proposed an initial public offering (hereafter “IPO”) of thyssenkrupp Elevator Technology Business (hereafter “Elevator Technology Business”) to the Supervisory Board. In addition to the IPO thyssenkrupp AG was also contemplating a full trade sale of the Elevator Technology Business to potential interested parties. On February 27, 2020, the Executive Board’s decision to sell its entire Elevator Technology Business to a consortium led by Advent, Cinven and RAG foundation was approved by the Supervisory Board of thyssenkrupp AG. The Elevator Technology Business—which designs and delivers passenger transportation solutions—has been separated from thyssenkrupp AG and its subsidiaries (hereafter “thyssenkrupp Group”). All companies making up the Elevator Technology Business have been transferred to thyssenkrupp Elevator International Holding B.V., Roermond, Netherlands, or thyssenkrupp Elevator Innovation and Operations AG, Düsseldorf, Germany, which was previously named thyssenkrupp Elevator AG until December 10, 2019 (hereafter “thyssenkrupp Elevator IaO2”[1]). In further steps, thyssenkrupp Elevator International Holding B.V. and its subsidiaries and thyssenkrupp Elevator laO and its subsidiaries were then transferred at December 6, 2019 and at December 31, 2019, respectively, under a new company named thyssenkrupp Elevator Holding GmbH, Essen, Germany (formerly thyssenkrupp Industrials GmbH, Essen, Germany, that was founded in June 2018 under the name thyssenkrupp Carbon2Chem Management GmbH, Duisburg, Germany). As of December 31, 2019, both companies are therefore 100%-subsidiaries of thyssenkrupp Elevator Holding GmbH, which is then the parent company of the thyssenkrupp Elevator Technology Group (hereafter “thyssenkrupp ET Group”). On January 16, 2020, name and legal form of thyssenkrupp Elevator Holding GmbH was changed to thyssenkrupp Elevator AG (hereafter “the Company”[2]). All legal entities and the Elevator Technology Business operating activities that comprise the thyssenkrupp ET Group have been transferred to thyssenkrupp Elevator International Holding B.V. or thyssenkrupp Elevator laO, or one of its direct or indirect subsidiaries as part of a restructuring under corporate law. Most of the German legal entities have been transferred into thyssenkrupp laO. Most of the foreign legal entities have been transferred into thyssenkrupp Elevator International Holding B.V. All legal entities not forming part of the thyssenkrupp ET Group have remained in the thyssenkrupp Group (hereafter “remaining thyssenkrupp Group”). Business operating activities attributable to the Elevator Technology Business that have not been conducted in Elevator Technology companies, have been transferred via asset deals into Elevator Technology Business legal entities. Operating activities attributable to the remaining thyssenkrupp Group that have been conducted in Elevator Technology companies have been transferred to the remaining thyssenkrupp Group companies. Due to the significant restructuring in the context of the legal reorganization, there is no historical financial information for the thyssenkrupp ET Group for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 that reflects the entire operating activities of the Elevator Technology Business. Prior to the legal reorganization the Elevator Technology Business did not exist as a separate group from October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2019, although it was under the common control of thyssenkrupp AG over that period. Therefore, combined financial statements were prepared for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017 (hereafter “Combined Financial Statements”). The Combined Financial Statements display a combined presentation on book value carry-over basis of IFRS group financial information of the Elevator Technology Business, as included in the historical thyssenkrupp AG consolidated financial statements for the respective periods. The Elevator Technology Business is defined as the future legal structure comprised of the Company, thyssenkrupp Elevator International Holding B.V., thyssenkrupp Elevator laO and their direct and indirect subsidiaries but also includes all Elevator Technology Business operating activities that historically were not yet 1 Until December 10, 2019, thyssenkrupp Elevator IaO refers to thyssenkrupp Elevator AG.

The operating activities attributed to the thyssenkrupp ET Group that were previously conducted in the thyssenkrupp Group companies have been recorded at their historical amounts. This combination of entities under common control is hence not displayed by applying the acquisition method in accordance with IFRS 3, but by using the predecessor accounting method using book values as reported in the historical thyssenkrupp AG consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Further information on the scope and basis of preparation of the Combined Financial Statements is presented in Note 02 and Note 03. The Combined Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards, as endorsed by the EU (hereafter “IFRS”). The Combined Financial Statements comprise combined statements of financial position, combined statements of profit or loss, combined statements of comprehensive income, combined statements of cash flows, combined statements of changes in equity and notes to the Combined Financial Statements for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The Combined Financial Statements are presented in euros, with all amounts rounded to the nearest million (million €) except when otherwise indicated; this may result in differences compared to the unrounded figures. The Combined Financial Statements were prepared on May 29, 2020 by the Executive Board of the Company. New IFRS accounting standards were applied in the Combined Financial Statements of the Elevator Technology Business in fiscal years from October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2019 in accordance with the same respective dates of first-time adoption of thyssenkrupp AG. Specifically, for IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”, thyssenkrupp AG adopted the standard in the fiscal year beginning on October 1, 2018, by applying the full retrospective approach to initial application. Due to the financial statements of that fiscal year for the thyssenkrupp Group only presenting one comparative period, the cumulative transition effects were included directly in retained earnings at the start of the comparative period on October 1, 2017. In contrast, for the Combined Financial Statements of the Elevator Technology Business, due to the additional comparative period from October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017 presented, according to the full retrospective approach, IFRS 15 has been applied starting as of October 1, 2016 for the Combined Financial Statements of the Elevator Technology Business (i.e. the cumulative transition effects were included directly in invested equity attributable to the thyssenkrupp Group at the start of the comparative period on October 1, 2016). The separate financial statements or reporting packages of the combined companies or operations, respectively, were prepared as of the respective closing dates for the Combined Financial Statements. The periods for recognizing adjusting events in the Combined Financial Statements are identical to the respective periods of the IFRS consolidated financial statements of thyssenkrupp AG. in the scope of combination with effect from October 1, 2016, in accordance with the above and below principles. At the time of the actual respective individual transfers subsequent to September 30, 2019, the acquisition of such business operations may decrease equity of the Elevator Technology Business if the consideration transferred exceeds the book value of the business operations acquired. Businesses as defined in accordance with IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” in analogy for transactions under common control that have been transferred to the Elevator Technology Business during the legal reorganization were included with their respective assets and liabilities as well as income and expenses in the Combined Financial Statements for the whole of the reporting period, i.e. from October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2019. Businesses that were acquired from a third party during the reporting periods of the Combined Financial Statements were included from the date at which the thyssenkrupp Group gained control. Companies and operating activities that constitute a business and that were not controlled by Elevator Technology Business companies after the legal reorganization had been finalized, were excluded from the scope of combination for all periods. Assets and liabilities that do not constitute a business in accordance with IFRS 3 that were acquired or disposed of by entities that were part of the Elevator Technology Business during the reporting periods of the Combined Financial Statements were included in or excluded from these financial statements as of the date of the transaction. Leased assets which will be legally transferred from the thyssenkrupp Group to the thyssenkrupp ET Group after the closing of the transaction, remained treated as leased assets in the Combined Financial Statements (for more details refer to Note 22). Operating activities that represent business operations that have been transferred as part of the legal reorganization to an existing or newly formed Elevator Technology company but historically were part of a legal entity that has remained in the remaining thyssenkrupp Group, were included in the scope of combination for all periods presented. These transfers to existing or newly formed Elevator Technology companies have been part of a “linked transaction”, according to IFRS 10.B97, that was closed as of December 31, 2019. For these Elevator Technology Business operating activities, separate IFRS financial information were prepared and appropriately included in the Combined Financial Statements. For the purposes of the Combined Financial Statements, income, expenses, assets and liabilities were attributed and allocated to the relevant Elevator Technology Business operating activities. Assets and liabilities as well as income and expenses were attributed directly or, where this was not possible, indirectly with the help of appropriate allocation keys (for example on the basis of employee headcount or revenues), which were applied consistently during the periods under consideration. Legal transfers to/from the Company or its direct and indirect subsidiaries during the reporting periods or after September 30, 2019 but before or on December 31, 2019 involving shares of companies are referred to in the following as “share deals” and the legal entities concerned as “share deal companies”. Legal transfers to the Company or its direct and indirect subsidiaries during the reporting periods or after September 30, 2019 but before or on December 31, 2019, that entirely relate to assets and liabilities or obligations are referred to in the following as “asset deals” and the Elevator Technology Business operating activities concerned as “asset deal companies”. A full list of the companies and Elevator Technology Business operating activities included in the scope of combination of the Combined Financial Statements is provided in Note 03 of the notes to the Combined Financial Statements. were adjusted annually by the percentage of any changes in their equity corresponding to the Elevator Technology Business’s percentage interests in the respective companies.

In addition a fixed amount of €74 million for the use of the brand for the period of no longer than 18 months after closing was agreed. Both, the amount receivable and the amount payable, are due immediately prior to closing. With the signing of the addendum agreement the intangible asset for the right of use of the thyssenkrupp brand will be classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5.

IAS 8.12 requires the consideration of the most recent pronouncements of other standard-setting bodies, other financial reporting requirements and recognized industry practices. In the Combined Financial Statements of the Elevator Technology Business presented below, the predecessor accounting approach has been applied in accordance with the recognized industry practices rules on business combinations under common control. The Combined Financial Statements of the Elevator Technology Business reflect the Elevator Technology companies and the operating activities assigned to the Elevator Technology Business as historically included in the IFRS consolidated financial statements of thyssenkrupp AG. In general, the Elevator Technology Business applied the same accounting policies and measurement principles in preparing the Combined Financial Statements as were used in preparing the IFRS consolidated financial statements of thyssenkrupp AG (using the “extraction method”). This approach was adjusted with respect to transactions with the remaining thyssenkrupp Group companies and to ensure IFRS compliance.

The legal transfer of the legal entities and the Elevator Technology Business operating activities in the context of the reorganization under corporate law that comprise the thyssenkrupp ET Group was not completed by September 30, 2019. As a result, financial statements of the Elevator Technology Business as of and for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 have been prepared on a combined basis only. The scope of combination for the Combined Financial Statements of the Elevator Technology Business for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was determined on the principles of the legal reorganization approach. This approach is based on the fact that the economic activities that form the new entity were not managed as one division in the past, but the entities and operating activities included in the scope of combination are legally bound together within a reorganization process. During the reporting periods of the Combined Financial Statements, the assets and liabilities forming the reporting entity were under common control of thyssenkrupp AG. The Combined Financial Statements have been prepared on the basis of the extraction method from the historical consolidated financial statements of thyssenkrupp AG taking into account the target structure of the reorganization. The structure of the scope of combination of the Elevator Technology Business for these Combined Financial Statements is comprised of the following: - The Company, - Legal entities that were fully dedicated to the Elevator Technology Business by virtue of their operations and were part of the legal reorganization and were transferred to the Company by December 31, 2019, - Assets and liabilities as well as income and expenses of Elevator Technology Business operating activities that were part of the legal reorganization and were transferred to the Company by December 31, 2019, - Joint ventures and other investments that were part of the legal reorganization and were transferred to the Company by December 31, 2019.

Therefore, only goodwill directly related to the Elevator Technology Business is reflected in the Combined Financial Statements. Goodwill (excluding goodwill of equity method investments) has been allocated to Cash Generating Units (CGU) of all business units. The recoverable amount of each CGU is determined based on a value in use calculation using after-tax cash flow projections based on bottom-up prepared financial budgets approved by thyssenkrupp AG’s management covering a three-year period. The last budget year is generally used to determine the cash flows beyond the budget period and modified to calculate the perpetuity considering additional assumptions. A business specific, sustained growth rate is taken into account; as a rule this growth rate amounts between 1.35% and 1.5%.

The ability to control a company in accordance with IFRS 10 results from: - holding power over an investee (normally achieved through a possession of more than half of the voting rights of a company); - being exposed to or having rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and - the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor’s returns. Capital consolidation is performed by offsetting the carrying amounts of subsidiaries against their attributable equity. On acquisition, the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. The interest of minority shareholders (non-controlling interest) is stated at the minority’s proportion of the fair values of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognized. All significant intercompany transactions and balances between Elevator Technology Business entities are eliminated on consolidation. Joint arrangements where two or more parties jointly control an activity either classify as joint operations or as joint ventures. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Where the Elevator Technology Business transacts with its joint operations or joint ventures, unrealized profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Elevator Technology Business’s interest. Subsidiaries and joint ventures which influence the Elevator Technology Business’s net assets, financial position and results of operations are only immaterial.

Impairment losses are recognized as an expense immediately. In case of impairment losses related to Cash Generating Units that carry a goodwill the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the Cash Generating Unit is reduced first. If the amount of impairment losses exceeds the carrying amount of goodwill, the difference is generally allocated proportionally to the remaining non-current assets of the Cash Generating Unit to reduce their carrying amounts accordingly. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (Cash Generating Unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount.

The fair values recognized on the statement of financial position usually reflect the market prices of the financial assets. Business in the future to enable them to be used. The assessment of their future recoverability is based on forecast calculations of the respective Elevator entity or tax groups. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized on temporary differences taxable in the future. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Elevator Technology Business has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities. Effects of changes in tax rates or tax law on deferred tax assets and liabilities are generally taken into account in the period in which the changes are enacted. Deferred and current taxes are recognized in the combined statements of profit or loss unless they relate to items recognized outside the combined statement of profit or loss in the combined statement of comprehensive income, in which case they, too, are recognized in other components of equity. recognized represents best estimate of the settlement amount of the present obligation as of the balance sheet date. Expected reimbursements of third parties are not offset but recorded as a separate asset if it is virtually certain that the reimbursements will be received. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a market rate. A provision for warranties is recognized when the underlying products or services are sold. The provision is based on historical warranty data and a weighting of all possible outcomes against their associated probabilities. Provisions for restructuring costs are recognized when the Elevator Technology Business has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has notified the affected parties. A provision for onerous contracts is recognized when the expected benefits to be derived by the Elevator Technology Business from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. If the performance obligations fulfilled for the customer exceed the payments received or due from the customer, contract assets are recognized in the statement of financial position on a net basis insofar as the right to receive payment from the customer is still conditional. Unconditional rights to receive payment are recognized under trade accounts receivable and from this point payment automatically becomes due with the passage of time. If the payments received or due from the customer exceed the performance obligations fulfilled, contract liabilities are recognized in the statement of financial position on a net basis. _Recoverability of goodwill_ As stated in the accounting policy, the Elevator Technology Business tests annually and in addition if any indicators exist, whether goodwill has suffered an impairment loss. If there is an indication, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit has to be estimated which is the greater of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. The determination of the value in use involves making adjustments and estimates related to the projection and discounting of future cash flows (cf. Note 04). Although management believes the assumptions used to calculate recoverable amounts are appropriate, any unforeseen changes in these assumptions could result in impairment charges to goodwill which could adversely affect the future financial position and operating results. _Recoverability of assets_ At each balance sheet date, the Elevator Technology Business assesses whether there is any indication that the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment or intangible assets may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated. The recoverable amount is the greater of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. In assessing the value in use, discounted future cash flows from the related assets have to be determined. Estimating the discounted future cash flows involves significant assumptions, including particularly those regarding future sale prices and sale volumes, costs and discount rates (cf. Note 04 and 05). Although management believes that its estimates of the relevant expected useful lives, its assumptions concerning the economic environment and developments in the industries in which the Elevator Technology Business operates and its estimations of the discounted future cash flows are appropriate, changes in the assumptions or circumstances could require changes in the analysis. This could lead to additional impairment charges in the future or to reversal of impairments if the trends identified by management reverse or the assumptions or estimates prove incorrect. _Other provisions_ The recognition and measurement of other provisions are based on the estimation of the probability of a future outflow of resources as well as empirical values and the circumstances known at the reporting date. This means that the actual later outflow of resources may differ from the other provisions, cf. also the remarks under Note 15. _Revenue recognition on construction contracts_ Certain entities and operations of the Elevator Technology Business report some of their business transactions as construction contracts, in which revenue is recognized over time using the percentage-of-completion method. This method requires accurate estimates of the extent of progress towards completion. Depending on the methodology to determine contract progress, the significant estimates include total contract costs, remaining costs to completion, total contract revenues, contract risks and other judgments. The management of the operating companies continually reviews all estimates involved in such construction contracts and adjust them as necessary. The expected variable consideration amount is estimated at the inception of a contract with a customer. The estimate is made using either the probability-weighted expected value or the most likely amount. The estimation method giving the better forecast for the respective contract is always used. The variable consideration amount estimated at contract inception is reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted as necessary. In the case of contracts with customers which have multiple distinct performance obligations, the required allocation of the transaction price to the distinct performance obligations is carried out by reference to the relative standalone selling prices. The relative standalone selling prices used generally correspond to directly observable market prices at which the Elevator Technology company separately sells the performance obligations to other customers. If the standalone selling price is not directly observable, a best estimate of the standalone selling price is made. In these cases an adjusted market assessment approach, an expected cost plus a margin approach, or a residual approach is used. _Income taxes_ The recognition and measurement of current and deferred tax receivables and liabilities depend on management estimates of tax uncertainties and future business performance. This includes both the interpretation of existing F-60 ----- tax regulations and the testing of deferred tax assets for impairment. These estimates are adjusted when there is sufficient evidence of the need for such adjustment. _Employee benefits_ The Elevator Technology Business accounts for pension and other postretirement benefits in accordance with actuarial valuations. These valuations rely on statistical and other factors in order to anticipate future events. These factors include key actuarial assumptions including the discount rate, expected salary increases and mortality rates. These actuarial assumptions may differ materially from actual developments due to changing market and economic conditions and therefore result in a significant change in postretirement employee benefit obligations, of equity and the related future expense. (cf. Note 14 for further information). _Legal contingencies_ Elevator Technology companies are parties to litigations related to a number of matters as described in Note 20. The outcome of these matters may have a material effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Management regularly analyzes current information about these matters and provides provisions for probable contingent losses including the estimate of legal expense to resolve the matters. For the assessments internal and external lawyers are used. In making the decision regarding the need for loss provisions, management considers the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a sufficiently reliable estimate of the amount of loss. The filing of a suit or formal assertion of a claim against Elevator Technology companies or the disclosure of any such suit or assertions, does not automatically indicate that a provision of a loss may be appropriate. €417.7 million as of October 1, 2016, €410.3 million as of September 30, 2017 and €445.8 million as of September 30, 2018. As of October 1, 2016, aside from the reclassifications from current non-financial assets to contract assets and current non-financial liabilities to contract liabilities in the amount of €209.6 million and €1,274.5 million, respectively, no further material transition effects were identified. For the combined statements of financial position as of September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2018, the identification of such reclassification effects was determined not to be practical. Since the reporting entity has not previously prepared financial statements for the periods presented applying IAS 18 and since these special purpose Combined Financial Statements present the application of IFRS 15 for all periods presented, the Elevator Technology Business does not disclose an opening balance sheet as of October 1, 2016 and reconciliation effects on such balance sheet resulting from the adoption of IFRS 15. In July 2014 the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”. The new standard includes revised requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets, fundamental changes to the regulations on the impairment of financial assets, and revised rules on hedge accounting. The Elevator Technology Business adopts IFRS 9 in the fiscal year beginning on October 1, 2018. The option to apply the Standard prospectively was used and accordingly no adjusted comparative information was disclosed. Resultant transition effects are reported in invested equity attributable to the thyssenkrupp Group. The new hedge accounting rules are also applied prospectively. The transition effects at the date of adoption were recognized directly in equity and the comparative periods are presented in accordance with the previous rules of IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement”. The effects of the transition on assets, liabilities and total equity are presented in the following two tables: The effects of the changed classification and measurement of financial assets at the adoption date were as follows: The effects of the adoption of the new impairment model in accordance with IFRS 9 are presented in the following table: Based on the contracts concluded at the balance sheet date, the Elevator Technology Business expects an increase in non-current assets and financial debt and an associated increase in the balance sheet total of approx. €0.4 billion. Related to the balance sheet total at September 30, 2019, the adoption of IFRS 16 would result in a reduction of the equity ratio of approx. 1 percentage point. In the combined statement of profit or loss, expense from operating leases was previously stated in the respective functional cost types. Future minimum lease payments and the expense from operating leases in fiscal year 2018/2019 are shown in Note 20. In fiscal year 2019/2020, EBIT is relieved immaterially and net financial income/(expense) is charged correspondingly. This results from eliminated operating lease expenses according to IAS 17 and from the initial recognition of depreciation of right-of-use assets from October 1, 2019 according to IFRS 16. The changed presentation of expense from operating leases will also result in a shift from cash flows from operating activities to cash flows from financing activities. This is because operating cash flows are no longer impacted by lease payments, only by interest payments whereas repayments are shown in cash flows from financing activities. In fiscal year 2019/2020 this will result in a higher double-digit million effect. The Elevator Technology Business will recognize right-of-use assets under property, plant and equipment and lease liabilities under financial debt on the statement of financial position. In addition to the standard presented above in detail, the IASB has issued further interpretations and amendments to standards and interpretations whose application is also not yet mandatory and which in part require EU endorsement before they can be applied. Management currently assumes that the application of these standards, interpretations and amendments will not have a material impact on the presentation of the Combined Financial Statements: - Amendments to IFRS 10 “Consolidated Financial Statements” and IAS 28 “Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (2011)”: “Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture”, issued in September 2014, initial application deferred indefinitely - IFRIC 23: “Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments”, issued in June 2017, initial application in fiscal year 2019/2020 - Amendments to IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”, issued in October 2017, initial application in fiscal year 2019/2020 - Amendments to IAS 28: “Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures”, issued in October 2017, initial application in fiscal year 2019/2020 - Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2015-2017 Cycle, issued in December 2017, initial application in fiscal year 2019/2020 - Amendments to IAS 19: “Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement”, issued in February 2018, initial application in fiscal year 2019/2020 - Amendments to IFRS Framework: “Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards”, issued in March 2018, initial application in fiscal year 2020/2021 - Amendments to IFRS 3: “Definition of a Business (Amendments to IFRS 3)”, issued in October 2018, initial application in fiscal year 2020/2021 - Amendments to IAS 1 und IAS 8: “Definition of Material (Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8)”, issued in October 2018, initial application in fiscal year 2020/2021 - Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7: “Interest Rate Benchmark Reform”, issued in September 2019, initial application in fiscal year 2020/2021 - Amendments to IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current”, issued in January 2020, not yet endorsed, expected initial application in fiscal year 2022/2023 proposed to defer to fiscal year 2023/2024 due to the Covid-19 pandemic F-66 ----- - Narrow-scope Amendments to IFRS Standards IFRS 3, IAS 16, IAS 37 and Annual Improvements to IFRS 1, IFRS 9.

If the fair value is positive, they are recognized as financial assets, otherwise as financial liabilities. If they do not qualify for hedge accounting, they are recognized at fair value in profit or loss, and gains or losses due to fluctuations in fair value are recognized immediately in profit or loss.

With the exception of net interest, all income and expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognized in income/(loss) from operations. Net interest included in net periodic pension cost is recognized in net financial income/(expense) in the Elevator Technology Business’s combined statement of profit or loss. The Elevator Technology Business’s obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are recognized as expense in income/(loss) from operations as incurred. The effects of remeasurements of pensions and similar obligations are recognized in other comprehensive income and reported in invested equity attributable to the thyssenkrupp Group. They consist of actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets and changes in the effects of asset ceiling excluding amounts already included in net interest. Deferred taxes relating to remeasurements are also recognized in other comprehensive income. The Elevator Technology Business also maintains multi-employer plans. In principle, these multi-employer plans contain defined benefit plans as well as defined contribution plans. With respect to defined benefit multiemployer plans these are accounted for in the same way as any other defined benefit plan in case the required information is available. Otherwise these plans are accounted for as defined contribution plans. In particular in the USA and in the Netherlands, there exist multi-employer defined benefit plans that are accounted for as defined contribution plans due to the fact that the pension obligations and the plan assets cannot be assigned to the participating employers.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

Transfer takes place when the customer obtains control of the promised goods or services. This is generally the case when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the transferred goods or services. Revenue from contracts with customers corresponds to the transaction price. The transaction price includes variable consideration only to the extent it is highly probable that actual occurrence of the variable consideration will not result in a significant revenue reversal. Variable consideration can include for example volume discounts, delay penalties, early completion incentives, or credits in connection with bonus agreements. The transaction price is not adjusted for a financing component, mainly because the period between the transfer of goods and services and the date of payment by the customer is generally less than 12 months. Where a contract with a customer has multiple distinct performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations by reference to their relative standalone selling prices. The standalone selling prices are determined on the basis of directly observable market prices or using recognized estimation methods. Revenue from the sale of goods and commodities is recognized at the point in time at which control is transferred to the customer. The time of transfer of control is determined partly on the basis of the delivery clauses agreed with the customer. Sales revenue from contracts with customers in the new installation and modernization business is recognized over time by the percentage-of-completion method. The percentage of completion is as a rule determined by the ratio of contract costs incurred up to the reporting date to the total estimated contract costs as of the reporting date. Contract losses are recognized as expense immediately and reported in the statement of financial position under other provisions. The recognition of revenue over time for the performance of services is generally carried out through linear allocation of the transaction price over the service performance period. Incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer are capitalized under non-current non-financial assets only if they relate to contracts with an original expected duration of more than 12 months. They are amortized by the straight-line method over the term of the contract. F-58 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

All estimates and assumptions are made to the best of management’s knowledge and belief in order to fairly present the financial position and results of operations of the Elevator Technology Business; they are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Accounting estimates and judgments made by management in the application of IFRS that have a significant effect on the Combined Financial Statements are in particular relevant for the following issues: _Business combinations_ As a result of acquisitions the Elevator Technology Business recognized goodwill in its statement of financial position. In a business combination, all identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair value. One of the most significant estimates relates to the determination of the fair value of these assets and liabilities. Land, buildings and equipment are usually independently appraised while marketable securities are valued at market price. If any intangible assets are identified, depending on the type of intangible asset and the complexity of determining its fair value, the Elevator Technology Business either consults with an independent external valuation expert or develops the fair value internally, using an appropriate valuation technique which is generally based on a forecast of the total expected future net cash flows. These evaluations are linked closely to the assumptions made by management regarding the future performance of the assets concerned and any changes in the discount rate applied.

The purpose of the new standard on revenue recognition is to bring together the large number of existing guidelines contained in various standards and interpretations. At the same time it establishes uniform core principles to be applied to all industries and all types of revenue transactions. In April 2016 clarifications to IFRS 15 were issued relating mainly to the identification of separate performance obligations as well as the definition of principal and agent. The thyssenkrupp Group adopted IFRS 15 for the 2018/2019 fiscal year beginning on October 1, 2018 (IFRS 15 effective date). The full retrospective approach to initial application was applied, i.e. the cumulative transition effects were included directly in retained earnings at the start of the comparative period on October 1, 2017. For the Combined Financial Statements of the Elevator Technology Business an additional comparative period from October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017 is presented. According to the full retrospective approach, IFRS 15 was applied starting as of October 1, 2016 for the Combined Financial Statements of the Elevator Technology Business (i.e. the cumulative transition effects were included directly in invested equity attributable to the thyssenkrupp Group at the start of the comparative period on October 1, 2016). With this the Elevator Technology Business is making use of the practical expedients provided in IFRS 15. In this connection at October 1, 2016 in particular contracts that begin and are completed within the same fiscal year or are completed at October 1, 2016 were not restated. The application of IFRS 15 results in contract assets, mainly relating to reclassifications of receivables from construction contracts to the contract assets required to be presented separately under IFRS 15. Further, the application of IFRS 15 results in contract liabilities mainly due to reclassifications from current non-financial liabilities, which relate to reclassifications of liabilities under construction contracts and to reclassifications of prepayments received. In addition, due prepayments not yet received in cash from customers are recognized as contract liabilities as explicitly required by IFRS 15. The IFRS 15 transition effects on the combined statements of financial position as of October 1, 2016, September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2018 were analyzed.

Under the new impairment model (expected loss model) expected losses are reported and forward-looking information is used to a greater extent. The new impairment rules are applied to debt instruments, lease receivables, trade accounts receivable, and contract assets recognized at amortized cost or at fair value in equity. The expected credit loss is generally calculated by multiplying the three parameters probability of default, carrying value of the financial asset, and loss given default. The Elevator Technology Business applies the simplified impairment model under IFRS 9 and reports lifetime expected losses for all trade accounts receivable and contract assets. For all other financial assets twelve-month expected credit losses are reported. Owing to the short maturities, these generally correspond to lifetime expected losses at the Elevator Technology Business. The Elevator Technology Business has developed the following model to determine the expected credit loss, in particular to determine the expected default rates for trade accounts receivable. The probability of default is determined on the basis of historical default rates taking forward-looking information into account. Consideration is also given to the respective business model, customer groups, and economic environment of the region. Default is generally assumed after 360 days. The expected credit loss for other loans and receivables is determined on the basis of external credit information. As before, financial assets are fully or partially impaired on the basis of individual allowances if it is reasonable to assume that they can no longer be fully realized, e.g. because the due date has long passed, or owing to insolvency or similar proceedings.

For the assessment of whether the useful life of the brand is finite or indefinite, following factors were mainly, but not exhaustive, considered: - the expected usage of the brand by the Elevator Technology Business and whether the brand could be managed efficiently by another management team; - typical product life cycles for this kind of brand and estimates of useful lives of similar assets that are used in a similar way; - the level of maintenance expenditure required to obtain the expected future economic benefits from the brand and the Elevator Technology Business’s ability and intention to reach such a level; - the period of control over the brand and legal or similar limits on the use of the brand. The brand is regarded as having an indefinite useful life, as based on an analysis of all of the relevant factors, there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the asset is expected to generate net cash inflows for the Elevator Technology Business. Therefore the brand will not be amortized. Furthermore it will be tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 38.108 and IAS 36; for more details regarding the adjustment of the agreement in March 2020 and the related impact refer to the disclosures in Note 32.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

For installments of the LTI granted inclusive of fiscal year 2013/2014 (inclusive of the 4th installment), the number of stock rights issued based on individually fixed euro amounts will be adjusted at the end of each three-year tkVA performance period based on the average thyssenkrupp Value Added (tkVA) over this period, beginning October 1 of the year the stock rights were granted, compared to the average tkVA over the previous three fiscal year period. For the installments of the LTI granted beginning with fiscal year 2014/2015 (starting with the 5th installment) the number of stock rights issued will be adjusted at the end of the respective three-year tkVA performance period based on the average tkVA over this period compared with a tkVA target value set in advance. The amount of payment for an installment is calculated by multiplying the adjusted number of stock rights by the average price of thyssenkrupp’s stock in the first three months after the end of the tkVA performance period, with the result that the term of each installment extends over four fiscal years in total. To determine the fair value of the stock rights used to calculate the pro-rata liability as of the balance sheet date forward prices of the thyssenkrupp stock are calculated taking into account the existing caps. The forward calculation is carried out for predefined periods (averaging periods) taking into account the thyssenkrupp stock price and the euro interest rate curve as of the balance sheet date and the dividends assumed to be paid until the maturity of the stock rights.

Those plans either are organized on an individual basis or via branch-wide solutions (“multi-employer plan”). Defined contribution plans are generally funded by compulsory, contractually or voluntary granted contributions paid into legally separated pension funds. The contributions are borne either by the employer or as a matching of employer and employees whereby the employer has no further obligation beyond the payment of contributions into the plan. All contributions are shown as personnel expense. Defined benefit plans are granted under consideration of country-specific Regulation (e.g. local legislation) or on voluntary basis. The plans are either funded via legally separated assets (“plan assets”) or directly funded by book reserves. The book reserve set out in the statement of financial position reflects the net value (obligations or asset) of defined benefit obligation and plan assets. The major exposure of defined benefit plans exists in Germany, Korea, France and Switzerland which covers 91% (2018: 91%; 2017: 91%) of the total defined benefit obligation respectively 89% (2018: 88%; 2017: 88%) of the plan assets of the Elevator Technology Business. For historical reasons a wide variety of voluntary defined benefit pension plans (DB plans) exist in Germany based on different risk profiles. As a rule such plans provide benefits in the event of disability and/or death or on reaching a specified age limit. The plans are mainly based on individual or collective arrangements. In the past the employer-funded pension plans in Germany generally offered annuity payments on defined benefits. These defined benefit plans (including final-salary pension plans, career-average pension plans, etc.) were established first in the far past but replaced at the turn of the millennium by contribution based pension DB plans with a risk-optimized form of payment (lump sum, installments, or annuity with limited indexation). Particularly for newly recruited professionals and managers, the “flexplan” was introduced at January 1, 2017 and replaced the last open “benefits plan” at thyssenkrupp. The “flexplan” is a contribution-based pension plan with a minimum guarantee interest of 1%. A key element to increase employees’ share in responsibility for their company retirement benefits is salary conversion, which is an option under all pension schemes currently open for new hires. Those plans additionally offer employer-funded matching contributions as an incentive. With regard to the funding of the company pension plans, particularly the “flexplan” is funded by a Contractual Trust Agreement (CTA) with a positive effect on the external funding level. The majority of Elevator Technology companies outside Germany also provide pension plans for their employees. These plans are in some cases based on statutory requirements or collective agreements (e.g. Korea, France or Switzerland), but in other cases they are provided by the companies of the Elevator Technology Business on a voluntary basis (e.g. Brazil). The range of benefits provided under the plans differs widely depending on local arrangements, extending from defined contribution plans to final-salary defined-benefit schemes with annuity payment. To safeguard the payments of benefits of DB plans, the pension plans outside Germany are funded to a much greater extent by externally separated assets. This is due in part to legal minimum funding standards, which require full external funding of the obligations or a financing under a capital funding system. For further information regarding the composition and investment strategy refer to the disclosures of the plan assets. F-86 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

In so far no obligations remain with the Elevator Technology company in the USA related to this defined benefit plan any more. As a replacement the company operates defined contribution plans in accordance with the “Internal Revenue Code 401(k)”. Beside such 401(k) plans, the Elevator Technology companies in the USA participate in a union-organized multiemployer plan (National Elevator Industry Pension Plan—“NEIPP”) for their unionized employees on the basis of a collective agreement. This plan is a defined benefit plan, but is accounted for as a defined contribution plan due to insufficient information about the allocation of assets. The risks from NEIPP differ from company-specific plans with regard to the jointly managed pension assets which can potentially also be used to cover obligations of other participating employers. When participating plan sponsors stop making ongoing contributions, the remaining plan sponsors collectively make up the unfunded deficit, with withdrawal from the plan regularly requiring the payment of a withdrawal contribution in order to limit the risk for the remaining plan sponsors. Material risks associated with the different types of pension plans include above all financial risks as well as risks in the areas of inflation and biometrics. Inflation risks which could lead to an increase in benefit obligations exist because some of the plans are based on (final) salary and in some cases annual pension modules are directly linked to current salaries (defined contribution plans). To this extent a rise in salaries above the salary/career trends assumed in the valuation of the obligation would also require a direct increase in the provisions (past service effect in the case of (final) salary pensions) or the future service cost (defined contribution plans). In addition, further charges could result from the need for a cost-of-living adjustment in excess of the assumed pension trend during the pension payment phase, which would lead to an immediate increase in the provisions. A significant number of the pension plans in Germany are required by law to provide a cost-of-living adjustment. A cost-of-living adjustment may also be required under (collective bargaining) agreements or agreed on a voluntary/discretionary basis. Biometric risks can result either from early benefit claims (risk of sudden changes to the statement of financial position after death or invalidity) or from underestimated life expectancies (longevity risk) and could likewise result in costs to the company due to unexpected increases in provisions and early cash outflows. Risks from changes to the discount rate are purely statement of financial position-related, i.e. the provisions are adjusted directly against equity without affecting income. Cash outflows are not affected. Under the pension plans in Germany, individual beneficiaries are in part counted more than once due to entitlements under different components of the pension systems. The breakdown of total of pension plans is as follows: In the year ended September 30, 2017, the settlements relate mainly to the replacement of a DB plan for the active workforce and simultaneous transition to a defined contribution plan as well as settlements of vested pension rights of former employees in the USA. established for each country as a function of their respective economic conditions. Discount rates are generally determined based on market yields of AA-rated corporate bonds of appropriate term and currency. As of September 30, 2019, the discount rate for pension obligations in Germany was 0.70% (2018: 1.70%; 2017: 1.90%).

For trade accounts receivable measured at fair value, the fair value equals the carrying amount less impairment losses recognized in other comprehensive income. Equity and debt instruments are in general measured at fair value, which is based to the extent available on market prices as of the balance sheet date. When no quoted market prices in an active market are available, equity and debt instruments are measured by discounting future cash flows based on current market interest rates over the remaining term of the financial instruments. The fair value of foreign currency forward transactions is determined on the basis of the middle spot exchange rate applicable as of the balance sheet date, and taking account of forward premiums or discounts arising for the respective remaining contract term compared to the contracted forward exchange rate. Common methods for calculating option prices are used for foreign currency options. The fair value of an option is influenced not only by the remaining term of an option, but also by other factors, such as current amount and volatility of the underlying exchange or base rate.

Companies and business operating activities of the Elevator Technology Business are required to implement credit risk management in accordance with these guidelines. In order to minimize default risks (credit risks) from the use of financial instruments, such transactions are only concluded with counterparties that meet our internal minimum requirements of the Elevator Technology Business. Predominantly, the Elevator Technology Business concludes its financial instruments currently and in the future with thyssenkrupp AG. Therefore, thyssenkrupp AG represents the main counterparty subject to credit risk. The Elevator Technology Business generally secures default risks with suitable advance and progress payments. Only in seldom cases, in case that a credit risk analysis provides a higher default risk, letters of credit and payment guarantees from banks, insurance companies and management companies are requested. In order to minimize default risks from operating activities, the corporate guidelines provide for the assessment of default risk based on the risk profile of the business partner using suitable internal and, where available, external information, such as ratings and credit reports, and the estimation of a financial risk exposure of the respective business transaction from the Elevator Technology Business perspective. The Elevator Technology Business takes a credit decision for each business transaction with each business partner using the aforementioned approach. Taking into account the individual characteristics of its customer structures and business models, the Elevator Technology Business lays down clear process rules for determining which measures are to be taken in the event of payment default in order to mitigate the maximum default risk as far as possible.

Hedging periods are generally based on the maturities of underlying transactions. Foreign currency derivative contracts usually have maturities of twelve months or less, but can also be up to six years in single exceptional cases. The US dollar is the only relevant risk variable for sensitivity analyses under IFRS 7, as the vast majority of foreign currency cash flows occurs in US dollars. As hedging transactions are generally used to hedge underlying transactions, opposite effects in underlying and hedging transactions are almost entirely offset over the total period. Thus, the currency risk exposure described here results from hedging relationships with off-balance sheet underlying transactions, i.e. hedges of firm commitments and forecasted sales. Based on our analysis, the US dollar exposure as of September 30, 2019 was as follows: If the euro had been 10% stronger against the US dollar as of September 30, 2019, the hedge reserve in equity and fair value of hedging transactions would have been €0 million (2018: €1 million; 2017: €2 million) higher and earnings resulting from the measurement as of the balance sheet date €2 million (2018: €2 million; 2017: €2 million) higher. If the euro had been 10% weaker against the US dollar as of September 30, 2019, the hedge reserve in equity and fair value of hedging transactions would have been €0 million (2018: €1 million; 2017: €3 million) lower and earnings resulting from the measurement as of the balance sheet date €3 million (2018: €2 million; 2017: €4 million) lower.",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

Refinancing and variable-rate financial instruments are subject to cash flow risk which expresses the uncertainty of future interest payments. Cash flow risk is measured by means of cash flow sensitivity. Opportunity effects arise from non-derivatives, as these are measured at amortized cost rather than fair value, in contrast to interest derivatives. This difference, the so-called opportunity effect, affects neither the statement of financial position nor the statement of profit or loss. Opportunity effects and interest rate risks affecting the statement of financial position and earnings are determined by calculating fair value sensitivity analyses and changes. As of September 30, 2019, a +100 /(20) basis point parallel shift in yield curves is assumed for all currencies in interest analyses.

Since September 30, 2019 further claims have been quantified in the ongoing course of the legal proceedings, which has not led to a change in the risk assessment and recorded provisions. A majority of the proceedings have now been dealt with through settlement, withdrawal or dismissal of the claims. Legal cases are still pending in Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands. They are at different stages of proceedings. thyssenkrupp has recognized provisions for the portion of the pending claims which thyssenkrupp believes will probably result in cash outflows. - The Company received €820 million from thyssenkrupp Nederland Holding B.V. as capital contribution on December 18, 2019. - As of January 16, 2020, the thyssenkrupp Elevator Holding GmbH changed its legal form into a German stock corporation and has been renamed to thyssenkrupp Elevator AG. The control and profit or loss transfer agreements (Beherrschungs- und Gewinnabführungsverträge) between the thyssenkrupp ET Group and thyssenkrupp AG as well as other thyssenkrupp Group companies have been terminated on December 31, 2019. - As of February 11, 2020, thyssenkrupp Industrials Finance Germany GmbH, Essen, Germany has been transferred to the thyssenkrupp ET Group and as of February 18, 2020 has been merged into the Company. - In 2011 the state of Delaware initiated an audit of certain entities within the scope of combination to determine their compliance with the Delaware Escheats laws, also known as abandoned and unclaimed property laws. A provision in connection with this matter was recognized for certain legal entities within the scope of combination. As a result of the current negotiations with the state of Delaware the related provision was reduced by a double digit € million amount after balance sheet date. This revaluation of the provision displays a non-adjusting event after the reporting period presented. - Since January 2020, there is a progressive global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in various actions – including lockdowns – that have been taken by governments all over the world in order to contain and to control the virus. COVID-19 impacted the markets and facilities in multiple ways, depending on the local exposure to the virus and the measures taken by local governments: The elevator and escalator business (segments Europe/Africa, Americas and Asia/Pacific) was affected to varying degrees. Nevertheless, the effect of the COVID-19 was felt in all regions, leading to complete lockdowns in some regions and milder restrictions in others. Although production came to a temporary standstill in some countries, most of the production facilities are currently operating and in the process of recovering. In most countries production capacities in our core factories have almost recovered to pre-pandemic levels. The Access Solutions business (segment Access Solutions) was affected in both business lines, Home Solutions and Airport Solutions. Activities for Home Solutions have been operated at a lower level with partial temporary shut downs of production facilities but are recovering constantly. The partial or complete shutdown of most airports has led to a decrease of New Installation and Service operations due to postponements and suspensions of some projects. The COVID-19 pandemic is considered as a triggering event for an impairment test of goodwill per March 31, 2020. Therefore, the operational planning of Elevator Technology was tested for validity against the background of the COVID-19 pandemic and, in effect, the recoverability of goodwill of the Elevator Technology Business was not classified as critical. Furthermore, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment were also tested for impairment per March 31, 2020 which did not result in any impairment losses for the Elevator Technology Business. Based on the uncertain progress of the COVID-19 pandemic, it cannot yet reasonably be predicted to what extent the pandemic will affect the future financial position and results of operations of the Elevator Technology Business. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic the accumulated ADJ EBIT of the Elevator Technology Business is currently slightly below the budgeted expectations. F-125 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,655

In substance, the terms and conditions of the addendum agreement lead to a limitation of the initially agreed indefinite useful life. The terms of the addendum agreement become effective subject to the condition precedent of all closing conditions of the transaction being fulfilled and will result in the repayment of the initially agreed fully paid up one-time fee in the amount of €1,080 million reduced by a fixed amount of €99 million for the use of the brand starting October 1, 2019 until closing. In addition a fixed amount of €74 million for the use of the brand for the period of no longer than 18 months after closing was agreed. Both, the amount receivable and the amount payable, are due immediately prior to closing. With the signing of the addendum agreement the intangible asset for the right of use of the thyssenkrupp brand will be classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5. - On February 27, 2020, the Executive Board’s decision to sell its entire Elevator Technology Business to a consortium of Advent, Cinven and the RAG foundation was approved by the Supervisory Board of thyssenkrupp AG. The purchase price (assuming closing of the transaction at June 30, 2020) is €17.2 billion. The purchase agreement has been signed in February 2020. The closing of the transaction is subject to merger control approvals, although thyssenkrupp continues to expect no concerns from the responsible authorities. Even under the circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, the closing of the transaction is expected by the end of the current fiscal year. Thyssenkrupp AG will reinvest part of the purchase price (€1.25 billion) in a stake in the Elevator Technology Business. - During the 1st half ended March 31, 2020, the Elevator Technology Business reported restructuring costs amounting to €14 million in the business units Europe/Africa and Americas.

These entities represent about 1.9 %, 1.6 % and 1.9 % of total sales, about 2.2 %, 2.5 % and 1.9 % of total assets and about -5.0 %, 0.7 % and 0.8 % of total net income of the Elevator Technology Business as of and for the years ended 30 September 2019, 2018 and 2017 respectively. Due to issues regarding the local bookkeeping and financial reporting processes which led to qualified, adverse or disclaimer of opinions on the financial information of these entities in several instances as at 30 September 2018 and 2017 and for the years then ended we were not able to obtain sufficient information and evidence required to assess the existence, completeness, valuation and cut-off of the assets and liabilities as well as the income and expense of these subsidiaries. As a result, we were unable to determine whether any adjustments were necessary in respect of these amounts included in the Combined Financial Statements as at 30 September 2018 and 2017 and for the years ended 30 September 2018 and 2017. Additionally, since we were unable to determine whether the combined statement of financial position as at 30 September 2018 give a true and fair view of the financial position, we were consequently unable to determine whether adjustments might have been necessary in respect of the profit for the year ended 30 September 2019 in the combined statements of profit and loss, comprehensive income and changes in equity as well as in respect of the net cash flows reported in the combined statement of cash flows for the year ended 30 September 2019. We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the “Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Combined Financial Statements” section of our report. We are independent of the entities included in the Elevator Technology Business in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the Combined Financial Statements in Germany, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Combined Financial Statements. As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Combined Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Elevator Technology Business’ internal control. - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. - Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Elevator Technology Business to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the Combined Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Elevator Technology Business to cease to continue as a going concern. - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Combined Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and whether the Combined Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Elevator Technology Business to express an opinion on the Combined Financial Statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
