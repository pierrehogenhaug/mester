352,Offerings 2019.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.2,"Changes in competitive offerings for entertainment video, including the potential rapid adoption of piracy-based video offerings, could adversely impact our business.","The market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. Piracy, in particular, threatens to damage our business, as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. Furthermore, in light of the compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth. Traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters and cable network operators, as well as internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their internet-based video offerings. Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition, exclusive rights to certain content and significant financial, marketing and other resources. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt -11 ----- more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing.

Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. Piracy, in particular, threatens to damage our business, as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. Furthermore, in light of the compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth. Traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters and cable network operators, as well as internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their internet-based video offerings. Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition, exclusive rights to certain content and significant financial, marketing and other resources. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt -11 ----- more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. If we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors, our business will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share, revenues or profitability.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"

A guarantee could also be deemed a fraudulent transfer if it was given with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud any entity to which the guarantor was or became, on or after the date the guarantee was given, indebted. The measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, a guarantor would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, is greater than all its assets, at a fair valuation; - the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they become due. -26 ----- We cannot predict: - what standard a court would apply in order to determine whether a guarantor was insolvent as of the date it issued a guarantee, or whether, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would determine that the guarantor was insolvent on that date; or - whether a court would determine that the payments under a guarantee would constitute fraudulent transfers or fraudulent conveyances on other grounds.

The offer must specify an expiration date (the “expiration date”) not less than 30 days or more than 60 days after the date of the offer and a settlement date for purchase (the “purchase date”) not more than five Business Days after the expiration date. The offer will also contain instructions and materials necessary to enable holders to tender their Dollar Notes pursuant to the offer. A holder of Dollar Notes may tender all or any portion of its Dollar Notes pursuant to an Offer to Purchase, subject to the requirement that any portion of a Dollar Note tendered must be in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. Holders are entitled to withdraw Dollar Notes they tendered up to the close of business on the expiration date. On the purchase date, the purchase price will become due and payable on each Dollar Note accepted for purchase pursuant to the Offer to Purchase, and interest on Dollar Notes purchased will cease to accrue on and after the purchase date. The Company will comply with Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and all other applicable laws in making any Offer to Purchase, and the above procedures will be deemed modified as necessary to permit such compliance. The Company will not be required to make an Offer to Purchase following a Change of Control Triggering Event with respect to the Dollar Notes if (1) a third party makes the Offer to Purchase in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Dollar Notes Indenture applicable to an Offer to Purchase made by the Company and purchases all such Dollar Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Offer to Purchase or (2) a notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the Dollar Notes Indenture as described above under the caption “—Optional Redemption.” Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, an Offer to Purchase may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditional upon the Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of such Offer to Purchase. Other indebtedness to which the Company or its Subsidiaries are, or may in the future be, subject to prohibitions of events that would constitute a change of control or require that the Company repurchase such debt upon a change of control. If the exercise by the holders of Dollar Notes of their right to require the Company to repurchase the Dollar Notes upon a Change of Control Triggering Event occurred at the same time as a change of control event under one or more of the Company’s other debt agreements, the Company’s ability to pay cash to the holders of Dollar Notes upon a repurchase may be further limited by the Company’s then-existing financial resources. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—Upon a change of control triggering event, we may not have the funds necessary to finance the change of control offer required by the applicable indenture governing each series of notes, which would violate the terms of each such indenture.” The phrase “all or substantially all,” as used with respect to the assets of the Company in the definition of “Change of Control,” is subject to interpretation under applicable state law, and its applicability in a given instance would depend upon the facts and circumstances. As a result, there may be a degree of uncertainty in ascertaining whether a sale or transfer of “all or substantially all” the assets of the Company has occurred in a particular instance, in which case a holder’s ability to obtain the benefit of these provisions could be unclear. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Dollar Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of the Company and, thus, the removal of incumbent management.

Restrictions on the Company’s ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants— Limitation on Subsidiary Debt”, “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens” and “—Certain Covenants— Limitation on Sale and Lease-Back Transactions.” Such restrictions in the Dollar Notes Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Dollar Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Dollar Notes Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford holders of the Dollar Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.

If an event of default occurs and is continuing (other than an event of default described in the last bullet point above with respect to the Company or any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary), either the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Dollar Notes may declare the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest of all the Dollar Notes due and immediately payable. In order to declare the principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest due and immediately payable, the trustee or such holders must deliver a notice that satisfies the requirements of the Dollar Notes Indenture. Upon a declaration by the trustee or such holders, the Company will be obligated to pay the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest so declared due and payable. If an event of default described in the last bullet point above occurs and is continuing with respect to the Company, then the entire principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest of the outstanding Dollar Notes will automatically become due immediately and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the trustee or any holder of Dollar Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company so elects, the sole remedy of the holders of Dollar Notes for a failure to comply with any obligations the Company may have or is deemed to have pursuant to Section 314(a)(1) of the Trust Indenture Act or to its failure to comply with the covenant described in “—Provision of Financial Information,” will for the first 180 days after the occurrence of such failure consist exclusively of the right to receive additional interest on the Dollar Notes at a rate per annum equal to 0.25% for the first 180 days after the occurrence of such failure (“Additional Interest”). The Additional Interest will accrue on all outstanding Dollar Notes from and including the date on which such failure first occurs until such violation -53 ----- is cured or waived and shall be payable on each interest payment date to holders of record on the regular record date immediately preceding the interest payment date. On the 181st day after such failure (if such violation is not cured or waived prior to such 181st day), such failure will then constitute an event of default without any further notice or lapse of time and the Dollar Notes will be subject to acceleration as provided above. Unless and until a responsible officer of the trustee receives at the corporate trust office an officers’ certificate stating Additional Interest is due, the trustee may assume without inquiry that no such Additional Interest is payable. The trustee shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any holder of Dollar Notes to determine whether any Additional Interest is payable, or with respect to the nature, extent or calculation of any taxes or the amount of any Additional Interest are owed, or with respect to the method employed in such calculation of any Additional Interest. However, after any declaration of acceleration of the Dollar Notes or any automatic acceleration under the last bullet point above, but before a judgment or decree for payment has been obtained, the holders of a majority in principal amount of outstanding Dollar Notes may rescind this accelerated payment requirement if all existing events of default, except for nonpayment of the principal and interest on the Dollar Notes that has become due solely as a result of the accelerated payment requirement, have been cured or waived and if the rescission of acceleration would not conflict with any judgment or decree. The holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Dollar Notes also have the right to waive past defaults, except a default in paying principal, premiums, if any, or interest on any outstanding Dollar Note, or in respect of a covenant or provision that cannot be modified or amended without the consent of all holders of the Dollar Notes. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the trustee will generally have no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Dollar Notes Indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders of the Dollar Notes, unless such holders offer indemnity to the trustee satisfactory to it against cost, loss, liability or expense.

The offer will also contain instructions and materials necessary to enable holders to tender their Euro Notes pursuant to the offer. A holder of Euro Notes may tender all or any portion of its Euro Notes pursuant to an Offer to Purchase, subject to the requirement that any portion of a Euro Note tendered must be in denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. Holders are entitled to withdraw Euro Notes they tendered up to the close of business on the expiration date.

If an event of default occurs and is continuing (other than an event of default described in the last bullet point above with respect to the Company or any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary), either the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Euro Notes may declare the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest of all the Euro Notes due and immediately payable. In order to declare the principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest due and immediately payable, the trustee or such holders must deliver a notice that satisfies the requirements of the Euro Notes Indenture. Upon a declaration by the trustee or such holders, the Company will be obligated to pay the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest so declared due and payable. If an event of default described in the last bullet point above occurs and is continuing with respect to the Company, then the entire principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest of the outstanding Euro Notes will automatically become due immediately and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the trustee or any holder of the Euro Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company so elects, the sole remedy of the holders of the Euro Notes for a failure to comply with any obligations the Company may have or is deemed to have pursuant to Section 314(a)(1) of the Trust Indenture Act or to its failure to comply with the covenant described in “—Provision of Financial Information,” will for the first 180 days after the occurrence of such failure consist exclusively of the right to receive Additional Interest on the Euro Notes at a rate per annum equal to 0.25% for the first 180 days after the occurrence of such failure. The Additional Interest will accrue on all outstanding Euro Notes from and including the date on which such failure first occurs until such violation is cured or waived and shall be payable on each interest payment date to holders of record on the regular record date immediately preceding the interest payment date. On the 181st day after such failure (if such violation is not cured or waived prior to such 181st day), such failure will then constitute an event of default without any further notice or lapse of time and the Euro Notes will be subject to acceleration as provided above. Unless and until a responsible officer of the trustee receives at the corporate trust office an officers’ certificate stating Additional Interest is due, the trustee may assume without inquiry that no such Additional Interest is payable. The trustee shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any holder of Euro Notes to determine whether any Additional Interest is payable, or with respect to the nature, extent, or calculation of any taxes or the amount of any Additional Interest are owed, or with respect to the method employed in such calculation of any Additional Interest. However, after any declaration of acceleration of the Euro Notes or any automatic acceleration under the last bullet point above, but before a judgment or decree for payment has been obtained, the holders of a majority in principal amount of outstanding Euro Notes may rescind this accelerated payment requirement if all existing events of default, except for nonpayment of the principal and interest on the Euro Notes that has become due -83 ----- solely as a result of the accelerated payment requirement, have been cured or waived and if the rescission of acceleration would not conflict with any judgment or decree.

If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the trustee will generally have no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Euro Notes Indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders of the Euro Notes, unless such holders offer indemnity to the trustee satisfactory to it against cost, loss, liability or expense. The holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Euro Notes will generally have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the trustee for the Euro Notes, provided that: - the direction is not in conflict with any law or the Euro Notes Indenture; - the trustee may take any other action it deems proper which is not inconsistent with the direction; and - the trustee will generally have the right to decline to follow the direction if an officer of the trustee determines, in good faith, that the proceeding would involve the trustee in personal liability or would otherwise be contrary to applicable law or would be unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other holder of a Euro Note, (it being understood that the trustee shall not have an affirmative duty to ascertain whether or not any such direction is unduly prejudicial to any other holder of a Euro Notes). A holder of any Euro Note may only pursue a remedy under the Euro Notes Indenture if: - such holder gives the trustee written notice of a continuing event of default; - holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Euro Notes make a written request to the trustee to institute proceedings with respect to the event of default; - such holders offer indemnity satisfactory to the trustee against cost, loss, liability or expense; - such trustee fails to pursue that remedy within 60 calendar days after receipt of the notice, request and offer of indemnity; and - during that 60 calendar day period, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Euro Notes do not give the trustee a direction inconsistent with the request. However, these limitations do not apply to a suit by a holder of a Euro Note demanding payment of the principal, premium, if any, or interest on a Euro Note on or after the date the payment is due.

352,Offerings 2019.md,327,CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS,327.1,U.S. Holders,327.1.1,Taxation of Interest,"A U.S. holder will be required to recognize as ordinary income any stated interest paid or accrued on the notes, in accordance with such holder’s regular method of tax accounting. In general, if the principal amount of a note exceeds its issue price by more than a statutorily defined de minimis amount, a U.S. holder would be required to include such excess in income as “original issue discount” over the term of the note, irrespective of the U.S. holder’s regular method of tax accounting. We expect, and the discussion below assumes, that the notes will not be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. holder who uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and who receives a payment of stated interest in euros (including a payment attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a note) will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of the euro payment received (determined based on the spot rate of exchange on the date the payment is received), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at that time.

The purchase agreements also provide that if an initial purchaser defaults, the purchase commitments of the non-defaulting initial purchasers of such notes may also be increased or the offering of such notes may be terminated. The initial purchasers may offer and sell notes through certain of their affiliates. We have agreed to indemnify the several initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and to contribute to payments that the initial purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities. The initial purchasers will receive customary commissions and discounts under the respective purchase agreement upon the consummation of the offering of the respective notes pursuant to this offering memorandum. We have been advised that the respective initial purchasers propose to resell the respective notes at the offering prices set forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum within the United States to persons they reasonably believe to be qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A) in reliance on Rule 144A and outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S. See “Transfer Restrictions.” The prices at which the notes are offered may be changed at any time without notice. The offering of the notes by the initial purchasers is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the initial purchasers’ right to reject any order in whole or in part. The offer and sale of notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and the notes may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S) except in transactions exempt from, or not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. See “Transfer Restrictions.” -103 ----- Accordingly, in connection with sales outside the United States, each initial purchaser has agreed that, except as permitted by the applicable purchase agreement and set forth in “Transfer Restrictions,” it will not offer or sell the respective notes within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (i) as part of its distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of this offering and the closing date, and it will have sent to each dealer to which it sells notes during the 40-day distribution compliance period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the notes within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of this offering, an offer or sale of notes within the United States by a dealer that is not participating in this offering may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act if that offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A. Each series of notes will constitute a new class of securities with no established trading market. In the case of the dollar notes, we do not intend to list the notes on any national securities exchange. In the case of euro notes, an application has been made to the Authority for such notes to be admitted to the Official List for trading on the Exchange. The issuer can provide no assurance that such application will be successful or that the euro notes will be admitted to the Official List and to trading on the Exchange. Consummation of the offering of the euro notes is not contingent upon obtaining such admission to the Official List or to trading on the Exchange. At this time an initial application had been made to the Authority for a preliminary review of the suitability of the notes for listing under chapters 5-7 of the listing rules. We cannot assure you that the prices at which the notes will sell in the market after this offering will not be lower than their respective initial offering price or that an active trading market for the notes will develop and continue after this offering. The euro initial purchasers have advised us that they currently intend to make a market in the euro notes, and the dollar initial purchasers have advised us that they currently intend to make a market in the dollar notes. However, they are not obligated to do so and they may discontinue any market-making activities with respect to the notes at any time without notice. In addition, market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you as to the liquidity of or the trading market for the notes. In connection with the offering, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, on behalf of the dollar initial purchasers, and Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc, on behalf of the euro initial purchasers, may purchase and sell the respective notes in the open market. These transactions may include over-allotment, syndicate covering transactions and stabilizing transactions. Over-allotment involves syndicate sales of notes in excess of the principal amount of notes to be purchased by the initial purchasers in the offering, which creates a syndicate short position. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover syndicate short positions. Stabilizing transactions consist of certain bids or purchases of notes made for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the notes while the offering is in progress. Any of these activities may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the notes. They may also cause the price of the notes to be higher than the price that otherwise would exist in the open market in the absence of these transactions. The initial purchasers may conduct these transactions in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. If the initial purchasers commence any of these transactions, they may discontinue them at any time. We expect that delivery of the notes will be made to investors on or about, 2019, which will be the third business day following the date of this offering memorandum (such settlement being referred to as T+3). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade notes more than two business days prior to, 2019 will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially settle in T+3, to specify an alternate settlement arrangement to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the notes who wish to trade the notes prior to their date of delivery hereunder should consult their advisors. -104 ----- We have agreed in the purchase agreements for each series of notes, that we will not, for a period of 90 days after the date of this offering memorandum (other than with respect to the notes sold to the initial purchasers pursuant to the purchase agreements), without first obtaining the prior written consent of Morgan Stanley & Co.

The initial purchasers may conduct these transactions in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. If the initial purchasers commence any of these transactions, they may discontinue them at any time. We expect that delivery of the notes will be made to investors on or about, 2019, which will be the third business day following the date of this offering memorandum (such settlement being referred to as T+3). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade notes more than two business days prior to, 2019 will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially settle in T+3, to specify an alternate settlement arrangement to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the notes who wish to trade the notes prior to their date of delivery hereunder should consult their advisors. -104 ----- We have agreed in the purchase agreements for each series of notes, that we will not, for a period of 90 days after the date of this offering memorandum (other than with respect to the notes sold to the initial purchasers pursuant to the purchase agreements), without first obtaining the prior written consent of Morgan Stanley & Co.
