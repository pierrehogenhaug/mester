ARTICLE 2(1)(E) OF DIRECTIVE 2003/71/EC (AS AMENDED, THE “PROSPECTUS DIRECTIVE”),

**IMPORTANT: You must read the following before continuing. The following disclaimer applies**
to this Offering Memorandum following this notice, and you are therefore advised to read this carefully
before reading, accessing or making any other use of this Offering Memorandum. In accessing this
Offering Memorandum, you agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions, including any
modifications to them any time you receive any information from the Issuer as a result of such access.
This Offering Memorandum has been prepared in connection with the proposed offer and sale of the
notes described herein (the “Notes”). This Offering Memorandum and its contents are confidential and
should not be distributed, published or reproduced (in whole or in part) or disclosed by recipients to any

NOTHING IN THIS ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION CONSTITUTES AN OFFER OF NOTES FOR
SALE IN ANY JURISDICTION WHERE IT IS UNLAWFUL TO DO SO. THE NOTES HAVE NOT
BEEN, AND WILL NOT BE, REGISTERED UNDER THE US SECURITIES ACT OR THE
SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OF THE UNITED STATES OR OTHER JURISDICTION, AND

**Confirmation of your representation: In order to be eligible to view this Offering Memorandum**
or make an investment decision with respect to the Notes, you must be either (1) a QIB, or (2) a
non-US person purchasing the Notes in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S; provided
that if you are resident in a member state of the EEA you are a qualified investor (within the meaning of
the Prospectus Directive and any relevant implementing measure in each member state of the EEA).
This Offering Memorandum is being sent at your request. By accessing this Offering Memorandum or
accepting an e-mail with this Offering Memorandum attached, you shall be deemed to have
represented to us and the initial purchasers named as such in this Offering Memorandum (the “Initial
**Purchasers”) that:**

(1) you consent to delivery of such Offering Memorandum by electronic transmission; and

(2) either:

(a) you and any customers you represent are QIBs; or

(b) (i) you and any customers you represent are non-US persons outside the United States and
(ii) the e-mail address that you gave the Issuer and to which the e-mail has been delivered is
not located, and will not be deemed to be located, in the United States, its territories and
possessions (including Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Wake
Island and the Northern Mariana Islands), any State of the United States or the District of
Columbia; and


-----

(3) if you are resident in a member state of the EEA, you are a qualified investor (within the meaning
of the Prospectus Directive and any relevant implementing measure in each member state of the
EEA).

You are reminded that this Offering Memorandum has been delivered to you on the basis that you
are a person into whose possession this Offering Memorandum may be lawfully delivered in
accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which you are located, and you may not, nor are you
authorized to, deliver this Offering Memorandum to any other person. The materials relating to any
offering do not constitute, and may not be used in connection with, an offer or solicitation in any place
where such offers or solicitations are not permitted by law. If a jurisdiction requires that any offering be
made by a licensed broker or dealer and the Initial Purchasers or any of their affiliate(s) is a licensed
broker or dealer in that jurisdiction, such offering shall be deemed to be made by such Initial Purchaser
or affiliate on behalf of us in such jurisdiction. Under no circumstances shall this Offering Memorandum
constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of the Notes in
any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.

Prospective purchasers that are QIBs are hereby notified that the seller of the Notes will be relying
on the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the US Securities Act pursuant to Rule 144A.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any “retail investor” in the EEA. For these purposes, a
retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of
Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of
Directive 2002/92/EC (as amended, the “Insurance Mediation Directive”), where that customer would
not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a
qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Directive. Consequently no key information document
required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or
selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared
and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in
the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. This Offering Memorandum has been prepared
on the basis that any offer of Notes in any member state of the EEA will be made pursuant to an
exemption under the Prospectus Directive from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of
notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Directive. No
prospectus is required in accordance with the Prospectus Directive for the offer of the Notes.

Each subscriber for or purchaser of the Notes in the Offering located within a member state of the
EEA will be deemed to have represented, acknowledged and agreed that it is not a retail investor (as
defined above). The Issuer, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates and others will rely upon the trust
and accuracy of the foregoing representation, acknowledgement and agreement.

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market
assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is
eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels
for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any
person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into
consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II
is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either
adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate
distribution channels.

This Offering Memorandum has not been approved by an authorized person in the UK and is for
distribution only to persons who (i) fall within the definition of investment professionals (as defined in
Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005, as
amended (the “Financial Promotion Order”)), (ii) fall within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (such as certain high
net worth companies and unincorporated associations) of the Financial Promotion Order, (iii) are
outside the UK, or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment
activity within the meaning of section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”)
in connection with the issue or sale of any securities may otherwise lawfully be communicated or
caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”). This
Offering Memorandum is directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted on or relied on by


-----

persons who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to which this Offering
Memorandum relates is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant
persons.

This Offering Memorandum has been sent to you in an electronic form. You are reminded that
documents transmitted via this medium may be altered or changed during the process of electronic
transmission, and consequently neither the Initial Purchasers, nor any person who controls the Initial
Purchasers, nor any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents accepts any liability or
responsibility whatsoever in respect of any difference between this Offering Memorandum distributed
to you in electronic format and any version that will be made available to you at a later date on request
from the Initial Purchasers.

# Intertrust Group B.V.
## €500,000,000 % Senior Notes due 2025

Intertrust Group B.V., a private limited liability company (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid)
incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands (the “Issuer”), is offering (the “Offering”) €500,000,000 aggregate principal
amount of its % Senior Notes due 2025 (the “Notes”). Interest on the Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrear on
each and, beginning on, 2019. The Notes will mature on, 2025.

The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole or in part at any time on or after, 2021 at the redemption prices set
forth in this preliminary offering memorandum (the “Offering Memorandum”). Prior to, 2021, the Issuer will be
entitled, at its option, to redeem all or a portion of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of
the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, plus a “make-whole” premium, as described in
this Offering Memorandum. Prior to, 2021, the Issuer will also be entitled, at its option, to redeem up to 40% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price set
forth in this Offering Memorandum. The Issuer may also redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes upon the occurrence
of certain changes in applicable tax law. Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as described
in this Offering Memorandum, the Issuer may be required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes at 101% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of repurchase.

The Notes will be the Issuer’s senior unsecured obligations and will (i) rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the
Issuer’s existing and future senior obligations that are not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including obligations
under the New Facilities Agreement; (ii) rank senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s future obligations that are
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, if any; (iii) be effectively subordinated to any existing and future
secured obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such
obligations; (iv) be structurally subordinated to all obligations of the Parent Guarantor’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee
the Notes; and (v) be guaranteed by the Guarantors (as defined below), subject to contractual limitations that reflect
limitations under applicable law.

The Parent Guarantor and certain subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor (together the “Guarantors”) will, subject to
contractual limitations that reflect limitations under applicable law, jointly and severally guarantee the Notes (the
“Guarantees”). The Guarantees will be senior, unsecured, joint and several obligations of the Guarantors and will (i) rank
_pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior obligations of such Guarantor that are not expressly_
subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantor’s Guarantee, including obligations under the New Facilities Agreement;
(ii) rank senior in right of payment to all future obligations of such Guarantor that are expressly subordinated in right of
payment to such Guarantor’s Guarantee, if any; and (iii) be effectively subordinated to all existing and future secured
obligations of such Guarantor to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such obligations. Not all of the
Parent Guarantor’s subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes.

This Offering Memorandum includes information on the terms of the Notes and the Guarantees, including redemption
and repurchase prices, covenants, events of default and transfer restrictions.

There is currently no public market for the Notes. Application has been made to list the Notes on the Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange for trading on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange’s Euro MTF Market. There is no assurance
that the Notes will be listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or be admitted to trading on the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange’s Euro MTF Market.


**Investing in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 22.**

**Issue price for the Notes:** **%, plus accrued interest from the issue date, if any.**


The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the US Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the “US Securities Act”), or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. The Notes and the Guarantees may not
be offered or sold within the United States, except to qualified institutional buyers (“QIBs”) within the meaning of and
pursuant to Rule 144A of the US Securities Act (“Rule 144A”) or to non-US persons in offshore transactions in reliance on
Regulation S of the US Securities Act (“Regulation S”). For a description of certain restrictions on transfers of the Notes,
see “Plan of Distribution” and “Notice to Investors.”

The Notes will initially be issued in the form of global notes in registered form in minimum denominations of €100,000
and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. We expect delivery of the Notes to be made in book-entry form through a
common depositary of Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking, S.A. (“Clearstream”) on
November, 2018.

**IMPORTANT INFORMATION**

You should rely only on the information contained in this Offering Memorandum. The Issuer has
not, and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, Goldman Sachs International and ABN AMRO Bank
N.V., HSBC Bank plc, ING Bank N.V., London Branch, Mizuho International plc, MUFG Securities
EMEA plc, NatWest Markets Plc and SMBC Nikko Capital Markets Limited (the “Initial Purchasers”)
have not, authorized anyone to provide you with any information or represent anything about the Issuer
or the Offering that is not contained in this Offering Memorandum. If given or made, any such other
information or representation should not be relied upon as having been authorized by the Issuer or by
the Initial Purchasers. You should not assume that the information contained in this Offering
Memorandum is accurate as of any date other than the date on the front cover of this Offering
Memorandum.

The Issuer is not, and the Initial Purchasers are not, making an offering of the Notes in any
jurisdiction where the Offering is not permitted. You must comply with all laws applicable in any
jurisdiction in which you buy, offer or sell any Notes or possess or distribute this Offering
Memorandum, and you must obtain all applicable consents and approvals. Neither the Issuer nor the
Initial Purchasers shall have any responsibility for any of the foregoing legal requirements. See also
“Notice to Investors.”

Neither we, the Initial Purchasers nor any of our or their respective representatives are making any
representation to you regarding the legality of an investment in the Notes, and you should not construe
anything in this Offering Memorandum as legal, business, tax or other advice. You should consult your
own advisors as to the legal, tax, business, financial and related aspects of an investment in the Notes.
In making an investment decision regarding the Notes, you must rely on your own examination of the
Issuer and the terms of the Offering, including the merits and risks involved.

This Offering Memorandum is based on information provided by us and other sources that we
believe to be reliable. In this Offering Memorandum, we have summarized certain documents and
other information in a manner we believe to be accurate, but refer you to the actual documents for a
more complete understanding.

The information contained in this Offering Memorandum is believed to be correct as of the date
hereof. Neither the delivery of this Offering Memorandum at any time after the date of publication nor
any subsequent commitment to purchase the Notes shall, under any circumstances, create an
implication that there has been no change in the information set forth in this Offering Memorandum or
in our business since the date of this Offering Memorandum.

We accept responsibility for the information contained in this Offering Memorandum. To the best of
our knowledge and belief, having taken all reasonable care to ensure that such is the case, the
information contained in this Offering Memorandum is in accordance with the facts and does not omit
anything material that is likely to affect the import of such information.

The Initial Purchasers make no representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy
or completeness of the information contained in this Offering Memorandum. Nothing contained in this
Offering Memorandum is, or shall be relied upon as, a promise or representation by the Initial
Purchasers as to the past or future.

The Initial Purchasers will provide prospective investors with a copy of this Offering Memorandum
and any related amendments or supplements. By receiving this Offering Memorandum, you
acknowledge that you have had an opportunity to request from us for review, and that you have
received, all additional information you deem necessary to confirm the accuracy and completeness of
the information contained in this Offering Memorandum. You also acknowledge that you have not
relied on the Initial Purchasers in connection with your investigation of the accuracy of this information
or your decision whether to invest in the Notes.

The information set out in relation to sections of this Offering Memorandum describing clearing
and settlement arrangements, including in the section entitled “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form,” is

i


-----

subject to any change in or reinterpretation of the rules, regulations and procedures of Euroclear or
Clearstream currently in effect. While we accept responsibility for accurately summarizing the
information concerning Euroclear and Clearstream contained herein, we accept no further
responsibility in respect of such information. Neither Euroclear nor Clearstream are under any
obligation to perform or continue to perform under such clearing arrangements and such arrangements
may be modified or discontinued by either of them at any time. We will not, nor will any of our agents,
have responsibility for the performance of the respective obligations of Euroclear or Clearstream or
their respective participants. Investors wishing to use these clearing systems are advised to confirm
the continued applicability of these arrangements.

The Notes will be available initially only in book-entry form. We expect that the Notes offered
hereby will be issued in the form of one or more global notes (the “Global Notes”), which will be
deposited with, or on behalf of, a common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and/or
Clearstream. Beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and transfers of beneficial
interests in the Global Notes will be effected only through, records maintained by Euroclear and/or
Clearstream and their participants, as applicable. After the initial issuance of the Global Notes, Notes in
certificated form will be issued in exchange for the Global Notes only as set forth in the Indenture. See
“Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.”

The Initial Purchasers are acting only for us in connection with the Offering and not acting for any
other party. The Initial Purchasers will not be responsible for providing the protections offered to their
clients to any party other than us, nor for providing advice in relation to the Offering or any transaction,
arrangement or other matter referred to herein.

None of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), any state securities
commission or any other regulatory authority has approved or disapproved of the Notes and the
Guarantees, nor have any of the foregoing authorities passed upon or endorsed the merits of the
Offering or the accuracy or adequacy of this Offering Memorandum. Any representation to the contrary
could be a criminal offense in certain countries.

The Notes are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale and may not be transferred or
resold, except as permitted under the US Securities Act and the applicable state securities laws,
pursuant to registration or an exemption therefrom. As a prospective investor, you should be aware
that you may be required to bear the financial risks of this investment for an indefinite period of time.
Please refer to the sections in this Offering Memorandum entitled “Plan of Distribution” and “Notice to
_Investors.” By possessing this Offering Memorandum or purchasing any Note, you will be deemed to_
have represented and agreed to all of the provisions contained in those sections of this Offering
Memorandum.

We reserve the right to withdraw the Offering at any time. We are making the Offering subject to
the terms described in this Offering Memorandum and the purchase agreement relating to the Notes
and the Guarantees (the “Purchase Agreement”). We and the Initial Purchasers also reserve the right
to reject any offer to purchase the Notes and the Guarantees in whole or in part for any reason or no
reason and to allot to any prospective purchaser less than the full amount of the Notes sought by it. We
and the Initial Purchasers also reserve the right to sell less than all the Notes offered by this Offering
Memorandum. The Initial Purchasers and certain of their respective related entities may also acquire or
may have already acquired, for their own accounts, a portion of the Notes.

Application has been made to the Authority for the listing of the Notes on the Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to be admitted for trading on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange’s
Euro MTF Market in accordance with the rules and regulations of that exchange.

In the course of any review by the relevant competent authority, we may be requested to make
changes to the financial and other information included in this Offering Memorandum in producing
listing particulars for such listing. Comments by a competent authority may require significant
modification or reformulation of information contained in this Offering Memorandum or may require the
inclusion of additional information. The appropriate competent authority may also require us to update
the information in this Offering Memorandum to reflect changes in its business, financial condition or

ii

results of operations and prospects. There can be no assurance that the Notes will be listed on the
Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, that such permission to deal in the Notes on the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange’s Euro MTF Market will be granted or that such listing will be maintained,
and settlement of the Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing. Any investor or potential
investor in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) should not base any investment decision relating
to the Notes on the information contained in this Offering Memorandum after publication of the listing
particulars and should refer instead to those listing particulars.

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market
assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is
eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels
for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any
person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into
consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II
is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either
adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate
distribution channels.

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the
date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be five business days (as
such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the “Exchange Act”)) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is
being referred to as “T+5”). Under Rule 15c6-one of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market
generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly
agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering
Memorandum or the next two successive business days will be required to specify an alternative
settlement code at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes
who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors. See “Plan of Distribution.”

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS IN THE UNITED STATES**

The Offering is being made in the United States in reliance upon an exemption from the
registration requirements of the US Securities Act for an offer and sale of the Notes which does not
involve a public offering. In making your purchase, you will be deemed to have made certain
acknowledgments, representations and agreements. See “Important Notice.” The Notes have not been

**NOTICE TO CERTAIN EUROPEAN INVESTORS**

**_European Economic Area_**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any “retail investor” in the EEA. For these purposes, a
retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of
Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of
Directive 2002/92/EC (as amended, the “Insurance Mediation Directive”), where that customer would
not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a
qualified investor as defined in Directive 2003/71/EC (as amended, the “Prospectus Directive”).
Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended,
the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail
investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making
them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation. This

the EEA (a “Member State”) will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Directive

prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Directive. No prospectus is required in accordance with
the Prospectus Directive for the Offering.

Each subscriber for or purchaser of the Notes in the Offering located within a member state of the
EEA will be deemed to have represented, acknowledged and agreed that it is not a retail investor (as
defined above). The Issuer, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates and others will rely upon the trust

intermediary transferring the Notes for any damages suffered by the investors.

the restated text of the Spanish securities market law approved by Royal Legislative Decree 4/2015 of

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS IN CANADA**

The distribution of Notes in Canada is being made only in the provinces of Ontario, Quebec,
Alberta and British Columbia on a private placement basis exempt from the requirement that we
prepare and file a prospectus with the securities regulatory authorities in each province where trades of
the Notes are made. Any resale of the Notes in Canada must be made under applicable securities laws
which may vary depending on the relevant jurisdiction, and which may require resales to be made
under available statutory exemptions or under a discretionary exemption granted by the applicable
Canadian securities regulatory authority. Purchasers are advised to seek legal advice prior to any
resale of the Notes.

By purchasing Notes in Canada and accepting delivery of a purchase confirmation, a purchaser is
representing to us and the Initial Purchasers that:

    - the purchaser is entitled under applicable provincial securities laws to purchase the Notes
without the benefit of a prospectus qualified under those securities laws as it is an “accredited
investor” as defined under National Instrument 45-106—Prospectus Exemptions or
Section 73.3(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario), as applicable;

    - the purchaser is a “permitted client” as defined in National Instrument 31-103—Registration
Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations;

    - where required by law, the purchaser is purchasing as principal and not as agent; and

    - the purchaser has reviewed the text above under Resale Restrictions.

Canadian purchasers are hereby notified that the Initial Purchasers are relying on the exemption
set out in section 3A.3 or 3A.4, if applicable, of National Instrument 33-105—Underwriting Conflicts
from having to provide certain conflict of interest disclosure in this Offering Memorandum.

Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser with
remedies for rescission or damages if this Offering Memorandum (including any amendment thereto)
contains a misrepresentation, provided that the remedies for rescission or damages are exercised by
the purchaser within the time limit prescribed by the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or
territory. The purchaser should refer to any applicable provisions of the securities legislation of the
purchaser’s province or territory for particulars of these rights or consult with a legal advisor.

-----

All of our directors and officers as well as the experts named herein may be located outside of
Canada and, as a result, it may not be possible for Canadian purchasers to effect service of process
within Canada upon us or those persons. All or a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of
those persons may be located outside of Canada and, as a result, it may not be possible to satisfy a
judgment against us or those persons in Canada or to enforce a judgment obtained in Canadian courts
against us or those persons outside of Canada.

Canadian purchasers of the Notes should consult their own legal and tax advisors with respect to
the tax consequences of an investment in the Notes in their particular circumstances and about the
eligibility of the Notes for investment by the purchaser under relevant Canadian legislation.

Memorandum and may include statements that concern, among other things:

    - strategies, outlook and growth prospects;

    - future plans and potential for growth;

    - trends affecting our financial condition or results of operations;

currently available to our management. Forward-looking statements therefore speak only as of the date
they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any of them in light of new information or
future events. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements
are reasonable, we can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct.

Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and
uncertainties. These statements are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to a
number of factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
described in the forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially as a result of
various factors including, but not limited to:

    - an inability to attract, integrate, manage and retain qualified personnel or key employees;

    - potential litigation and investigations and risks associated with indemnifying employees;

    - adverse regulatory changes in jurisdictions in which our clients operate, including those

urge you to read this Offering Memorandum, including the sections entitled “Risk Factors,”
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and
“Business,” for a more complete discussion of the factors that could affect our future performance and
the industry in which we operate. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing
environment. We may face new risks from time to time, and it is not possible to predict all such risks;
nor can we assess the impact of all such risks on our business or the extent to which any factor, or
combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any
forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance
on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.

We undertake no obligation, and do not intend, to release publicly the result of any revisions to the
forward-looking statements which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this
Offering Memorandum, including changes in its business or strategy or planned capital expenditure, or
to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

**FINANCIAL DATA**

The historical and other consolidated financial data presented in this Offering Memorandum have
been derived from the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Group as
of and for nine months ended September 30, 2018, prepared in accordance with the recognition and
measurement requirements of International Accounting Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting and
reviewed by KPMG, our independent auditors (the “2018 Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial
**Statements”) and the audited annual consolidated financial statements of the Group as of and for**
each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, prepared in accordance with IFRS (as
adopted by the EU) and audited by KPMG, our independent auditors (the “Annual Consolidated
**Financial Statements,” and together with the 2018 Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial**
Statements, the “Financial Statements”) included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The 2018
Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contain comparative financial information as of
and for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, which has not been reviewed by KPMG, our
independent auditors.

The financial information presented for the twelve months ended September 30, 2018 is derived
by adding the unaudited consolidated statement of profit and loss for the nine months ended
September 30, 2018 to the audited consolidated statement of profit and loss for the year ended
December 31, 2017 and deducting the unaudited consolidated statement of profit and loss for the nine
months ended September 30, 2017. The consolidated statement of profit and loss for the twelve
months ended September 30, 2018 has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and is not
necessarily representative of the Group’s results of operations for any future period or the Group’s
financial condition at any future date. The consolidated statement of profit and loss for the twelve
months ended September 30, 2018 is not prepared in the ordinary course of our financial reporting or
in accordance with IFRS.

**CERTAIN KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS**

This Offering Memorandum also presents certain key performance indicators (“KPIs”) including
Adjusted EBITA, Adjusted EBITA Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Other
Operating Expenses, Adjusted Revenue, ARPE, Free Cash Flow, Ratio of Adjusted EBITDA Minus
Additions in PPE and Intangible Assets to Adjusted EBITDA and Underlying Revenue. These KPIs,
which have not been audited or reviewed, are not recognized measures of financial performance or
liquidity under IFRS. Nevertheless, these measures are used by management to monitor the
underlying performance of our business and operations. These KPIs may not be indicative of our
historical operating results, nor are such measures meant to be predictive of our future results. We
have presented these KPIs in this Offering Memorandum because we believe that these measures
provide an important indication of trends in our financial performance, our financial condition and our
results of operations. Furthermore, we believe that these KPIs are widely used by certain investors,
securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and
liquidity.

However, there are limitations inherent to the use of KPIs resulting from the fact that they exclude
expenses and other items that are required to be included in corresponding measures under IFRS. In
analyzing our future performance, investors should be cautioned not to place undue reliance on these
KPIs and are also advised to consider these KPIs together with the presentation of our financial
condition and results of operations under IFRS, rather than as an alternative to IFRS financial
measures. Furthermore, not all companies calculate such KPIs in the same manner or on a consistent
basis. As a result, these measures may not be comparable to measures used by other companies
under the same or similar names. Below is an overview of the main KPIs and related definitions used
in this Offering Memorandum:

    - “Adjusted EBITA” refers to Adjusted EBITDA less depreciation and amortization of other
intangible assets (which for purposes of this KPI does not take into account amortization of
acquisition-related intangible assets);

    - “Adjusted EBITA Margin” refers to Adjusted EBITA for the specified period divided by
revenue for the specified period;

xi


-----

    - “Adjusted EBITDA” refers to profit/(loss) from operating activities adding back depreciation
and amortization of other intangible assets and amortization of acquisition-related intangible
assets, and further adjusted for Specific Items;

    - “Adjusted EBITDA Margin” refers to Adjusted EBITDA for the specified period divided by
revenue for the specified period;

    - “Adjusted Other Operating Expenses” refers to other operating expenses for the specified
period adjusted for the 2015 Settlement. Under IFRS we were required to offset the amount of
a settlement with a client with the revenue generated from such client. As a result, our other
operating expenses line item for the year ended December 31, 2015 was reduced by the
amount of the 2015 Settlement, which only affected the other operating expenses of our
Luxembourg segment and therefore of the Group for the year ended December 31, 2015 and
had no effect on the other operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and
2017 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2018;

    - “Adjusted Revenue” refers to revenue for the specified period adjusted for the €0.3 million
revenue generated from a client in our Luxembourg segment with which we entered into the
2015 Settlement. Under IFRS we were required to offset the amount of the 2015 Settlement
with the revenue generated from such client. As a result, our revenue line item for the year
ended December 31, 2015 was reduced by the amount of the 2015 Settlement, which only
affected the revenue of our Luxembourg segment and therefore of the Group for the year
ended December 31, 2015 and had no effect on the revenue for the years ended
December 31, 2016 and 2017 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2018;

    - “ARPE” refers to the average revenue for the specified period per client entity as of the
specified date;

    - “Free Cash Flow” refers to net cash from operating activities minus capital expenditures and
interest paid;

    - “Ratio of Adjusted EBITDA Minus Additions in PPE and Intangible Assets to Adjusted
**EBITDA” refers to the difference between Adjusted EBITDA and additions to property, plant,**
equipment and intangible assets other than acquisition related assets, divided by Adjusted
EBITDA;

    - “Specific Items” refers to specific items of income or expense that, based on their
significance in size or nature, should be separately presented to provide further understanding
about the financial performance of the Group. Specific items include (i) transaction costs;
(ii) integration and transformation costs; (iii) share-based payment upon IPO; (iv) share-based
payment upon integration; (v) other income or expenses; (vi) one-off revenue; and (vii) one-off
expenses. Such specific items are not of an operational nature and do not represent the
Group’s core operating results; and

    - “Underlying Revenue” refers to revenue calculated on a constant currency and like-for-like
basis excluding the impacts of currency exchange fluctuations, including pro forma revenue
generated by acquisitions and excluding pro forma revenue generated by divestments for the
period specified; “on an Underlying Basis” and “Underlying Change” are to be construed
accordingly.

**PRO FORMA FINANCIAL MEASURES**

We also present certain unaudited pro forma financial information and adjustments, which have
been prepared for illustrative purposes only. Because of their nature, the pro forma financial
information and adjustments address hypothetical situations and, therefore, do not represent our actual
financial condition or results of operations for the periods presented or as of the presented dates.
_Pro forma adjustments are based on available information and certain assumptions and estimates that_
we believe are reasonable in the circumstances. However, these assumptions and estimates are
inherently uncertain, subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic and other risks and
may differ materially from our actual financial condition or results of operations. The pro forma

xii

adjustments presented in this Offering Memorandum are directly attributable to the Transactions,
thereby giving effect to the Transactions as if the Transactions had occurred on September 30, 2018.

The pro forma financial information and adjustments presented in this Offering Memorandum have
not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Article 11 of Regulation S-X of the US
Securities Act, the Prospectus Directive or any generally accepted accounting standards. In addition,
the pro forma financial information and adjustments presented have neither been prepared in
accordance with IFRS nor been audited or reviewed in accordance with any applicable auditing
standards, and you should not place undue reliance on them. The pro forma financial information and
adjustments should be read in conjunction with the information contained under “Summary—Summary
_Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data” and the balance sheet information contained in the_
Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. We have presented these
_pro forma financial information and adjustments to represent similar measures that are widely used by_
certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of
financial position, financial performance and liquidity. We believe these measures enhance the
investor’s understanding of our indebtedness and our ability to fund our ongoing operations, and our
ability to meet and service our obligations. However, these pro forma financial information and
adjustments are not measures determined based on IFRS or accounting principles accepted in other
relevant jurisdictions, and you should not consider such items as an alternative to the historical
financial position or other indicators of our cash flow and forward position based on IFRS measures.
The pro forma financial information and adjustments may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures as presented by other companies due to differences in the way our pro forma financial
information and adjustments are calculated. The pro forma financial information and adjustments
contained in this Offering Memorandum are not intended to comply with the reporting requirements of
the SEC and will not be subject to review by the SEC. Even though the pro forma financial information
and adjustments are commonly used by investors, they have important limitations as analytical tools,
and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our position or results as
reported under IFRS.

In this Offering Memorandum, each of the following pro forma measures has the following
meaning:

    - “pro forma cash and cash equivalents” refers to the cash and cash equivalents of the
Group after giving effect to the Transactions;

    - “pro forma cash interest expense” refers to the annual interest expense that would be
incurred on the pro forma total debt;

    - “pro forma net debt” refers to pro forma total debt less pro forma cash and cash equivalents;

    - “pro forma total debt” refers to the total borrowings of the Group after giving effect to the
Transactions;

    - “ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to pro forma cash interest expense” refers to Adjusted EBITDA
divided by pro forma cash interest expense; and

    - “ratio of pro forma net debt to Adjusted EBITDA” refers to pro forma net debt divided by
Adjusted EBITDA.

For more information on these pro forma financial measures see “Summary—Summary Historical
_Consolidated Financial and Other Data—Pro Forma Financial Data.”_

**ROUNDING**

Certain numerical information and other amounts and percentages presented in this Offering
Memorandum, including financial data, industry data, market data and operational data are presented
in millions or thousands; and values, fractions, proportions or percentages describing market sizes or
shares, have in each case been subject to rounding adjustments. Accordingly, in certain instances, the
sum of the numbers in a column or a row in tables may not conform exactly to the total figure given for
that column or row, or the sum of certain numbers presented as a percentage may not conform exactly
to the total percentage given.

Unless otherwise indicated, statements in this Offering Memorandum regarding the market

markets and segments in which we operate are based on data, statistical information, sector reports
and third-party studies as well as on our own estimates.

The market data and certain economic and industry data and forecasts used in this Offering
Memorandum were obtained from publications by international organizations and independent industry
sources, other publicly available information and reports prepared by reputable consultants (collectively

To the extent that information was taken from third parties, such information has been accurately
reproduced in this Offering Memorandum and, as far as we are aware and able to ascertain from the
information published by such third parties, no facts have been omitted which would render the
reproduced information inaccurate or misleading. However, market studies and analyses are frequently
based on information and assumptions that may not be accurate or technically correct, and their
methodology is by nature forward-looking and speculative. In particular, no responsibility or liability can
be accepted by any Industry Data Provider or any of its affiliates, nor any of its directors nor employees
for any errors or omissions in any data from the Industry Data Providers included in this Offering
Memorandum nor for any loss arising from reliance placed on such data. When information in this
Offering Memorandum is attributed to multiple external sources, including one or more Industry Data
Providers, such information is based on our analysis thereof.

We have not verified the figures, market data and other information used by third parties in our
studies, publications and financial information, or the external sources on which our estimates are
based. We therefore assume no liability for and offer no guarantee of the accuracy of the data from
studies and third-party sources contained in this Offering Memorandum or for the accuracy of data on
which our estimates are based.

This Offering Memorandum also contains estimations of market data and information derived from
such data that cannot be obtained from publications by market research institutes or from other
independent sources. Such information is partly based on our own market observations, the evaluation
of industry information (such as from conferences and sector events) or internal assessments. We
believe that our estimates of market data and the information we have derived from such data helps
investors to better understand the industry we operate in and our position within it. Our own estimates
have not been checked or verified externally. We nevertheless believe that our own market
observations are reliable. We give no warranty for the accuracy of our own estimates and the
information derived from them. They may differ from estimates made by our competitors or from future
studies conducted by market research institutes or other independent sources.

**EXCHANGE RATE INFORMATION**

The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, certain Bloomberg Composite Rates
expressed in US dollar per €1.00. The Bloomberg Composite Rate is a “best market” calculation, in
which, at any point in time, the bid rate is equal to the highest bid rate of all contributing bank
indications and the ask rate is set to the lowest ask rate offered by these banks. The Bloomberg
Composite Rate is a mid-value rate between the applied highest bid rate and the lowest ask rate.

The average rate for a year means the average of the Bloomberg Composite Rates on the last day
of each month during a year. The average rate for a month, or for a partial month, means the average
of the daily Bloomberg Composite Rate during that month, or partial month, as the case may be.

The Bloomberg Composite Rate for the US dollar against the euro on November 2, 2018 was
$1.1388 per €1.00.

**OUR KEY STRENGTHS**

**_Leading global provider in the expert administrative services industry with a comprehensive_**
**_service offering_**

We are a leading global provider of expert administrative services to clients operating and investing
internationally and as of December 31, 2017, based on revenue, we were the market leader in the
Netherlands and Jersey, the number two provider in Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands and we had
leading market positions in most of our key jurisdictions in the Rest of the World. As of September 30,
2018, we operated from a global network of 41 offices in 29 jurisdictions from which we administered
approximately 48,300 entities for our clients, enabling them to grow successfully, operate their
businesses efficiently and responsibly and fulfill their international legal, administrative and regulatory
duties. In addition to our offices, as of September 30, 2018, we had a network of approximately 40,000
business partner contacts (including in jurisdictions in which we were present), who referred work to us,
and a network of third-party service providers (“TPSPs”) in 144 jurisdictions in which we did not have a
presence, allowing us to assist our clients by referring them to our partners in jurisdictions where we do
not have an operational presence. Our leading global position provides an advantage over smaller
providers who may provide a narrower service offering or who operate in fewer jurisdictions.

We provide a wide range of expert administrative services to our clients across our service lines:
Corporates; Funds; Capital Markets and Private Wealth. We also provide various regulatory and
compliance services which are offered across all our four service lines. Our services are supported by
our continuously developing technology foundation and include core services offered in nearly all
offices and more specialized services provided from selected locations. We are an experienced and
expert player, servicing our clients for 66 years in an increasingly complex global environment and a
market becoming increasingly focused on quality. Our customers have come to trust our reputable and
global brand to deliver mission critical services.

**_Global secular and sustainable growth factors across highly regulated markets_**

Our addressable market, representing our service lines in the 13 key expert administrative
services jurisdictions (including the US, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the Cayman Islands, Jersey,
Guernsey, Switzerland, Hong Kong, the UK, Ireland, Singapore, Curacao and Spain) which we
primarily focus on is approximately €6.5 billion in size and has grown at approximately 3% to 5%
annually between 2015 and 2018, driven by growth in most of our service lines. Our Funds service line
is currently within the fastest growing market among our service lines, with annualized forecast growth
of 7% to 9% for the period from 2018 to 2021. Our clients operate in an increasingly complex global
environment focused on compliance, business ethics and transparency and we have a strong track
record of successful cooperation with regulators in key jurisdictions. Regulation is an important and
resilient driver of our market growth, in addition to increased complexity and specialization of the
services that our clients require. Historically, we have seen the consistent introduction of regulation,
and the pace and magnitude of change is increasing. As such, our client entities often require
additional services in order to ensure compliance with new regulations, resulting in higher ARPE
across our service lines. There are a number of ongoing and future regulation initiatives which
represent further opportunity, such as the Fourth and Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (“AMLD”)
and the US tax reform as well as potential legislation concerning the upcoming departure of the UK
from the EU (“Brexit”). In addition to increasing global regulation, our addressable market benefits
from a number of other underlying and continued drivers of growth:

    - _Globalization, Economic Growth and M&A Activity. Our markets are continuing to grow due to_
the increased internationalization of corporate and investment activities. As global assets
under management continue to grow, our clients require our services in order to deploy and
monitor capital in a way which is compliant, transparent and ethical and which fulfills specific
legal, administrative and regulatory duties. Corporations investing across numerous
jurisdictions require our services to implement tax efficient entities and assist them in
compliance with both local and international standards. Regulatory developments and
changes in the tax environment (such as the Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting
(“BEPS”), the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (“ATAD”) and the Multilateral Convention to


3


-----

Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) may
result in greater services per entity to maintain compliance, while reducing entity growth in
certain jurisdictions.

    - _Regulation, Substance Requirements, Complexity of Client Entities, Need of Additional_
_Services and Outsourcing. In addition to increasing regulatory complexity, increasing_
compliance requirements for clients drive the demand for transparency and substance related
services (which in turn drives billable hours per entity and ARPE). Clients are increasingly
relying on expert external providers to handle growing regulatory, risk management and
compliance requirements due to their specialized capabilities and greater scale. This
increased outsourcing allows organizations to focus on their core capabilities, reduce
administrative burden, manage costs and reduce organizational complexity.

**_Resilient business model providing mandatory and “mission critical” services on a recurring_**
**_basis._**

We provide mission critical, non-discretionary services, which help to ensure that clients are
compliant with relevant regulations and are therefore considered critical from a legal, regulatory,
financial, reputational and risk management perspective. For our clients, the costs associated with
providing our range of administrative services are often considered to be non-discretionary, since our
clients generally require these services irrespective of their financial or operational performance, given
the costs of failure can be high, both in terms of the severity of penalties (including fines or criminal
prosecution) and the potential reputational damage suffered as a result of non-compliance.

We estimate that approximately 90% of our total revenue is generated by on-going compliance
and maintenance services of client entities which for the most part can be considered as recurring. The
remaining 10% relates to non-recurring revenue such as revenue generated by incorporations and
liquidations.

Our business model benefits from added resilience due to the high-cost of switching administrative
service providers, both financially and through the risk that critical services might not be provided to the
same quality. In addition, the non-discretionary nature of our offering means that macro-economic
fluctuations have historically had limited impact on our industry as expert administrative services
required are not dependent on financial or operational performance. Our wide range of expert
administrative services provides a complete solution for both event driven demands and for the
ongoing requirements of doing business.

**_Diversified client base across service lines and geographies_**

Our longstanding clients are diversified across our service lines: Corporates; Funds; Capital
Markets; and Private Wealth. In addition our clients are also diversified across geographies. As of
September 30, 2018, we had clients based in approximately 140 jurisdictions and were not reliant on
any single jurisdiction for our revenue. The Netherlands accounted for €116.4 million (23.7%),
Luxembourg for €105.2 million (21.4%), the Americas for €85.1 million (17.3%), Jersey for
€57.6 million (11.7%) and the Rest of the World for €126.5 million (25.8%) of our revenue for the
twelve months ended September 30, 2018 amounting to €490.8 million. Similarly, we had a diversified
client portfolio with our ten largest clients accounting for approximately 8% of our revenue for the year
ended December 31, 2017, and none of our clients representing more than 1.6%.

Our wide range of services provides a diversified product offering, including core services such as
incorporation, management, legal and tax compliance, reporting and liquidation, and also specialized
services such as fund administration, depository services, portfolio administrative services, treasury
and investment services and investor reporting. Core services are offered across all our four service
lines, whereas specialized services are more specific to the relevant service line. Core services
represented approximately 75% of our revenue in the twelve months ended September 30, 2018, and
our specialized services represented approximately 25% of our revenue in the twelve months ended
September 30, 2018.

We have a high quality client base representing a broad array of industries and are focused on
multinational corporations, financial institutions, fund managers, high net worth individuals and family


4


-----

offices. As of September 30, 2018, our client base included 60% of the Top 10 and 50% of the Top 50
Fortune 500 companies as well as 80% of the Top 50 of the Private Equity International Top 300. Our
longstanding relationship with our high quality clients supports our ability to secure multi-year contracts
and to cross-sell our wide range of services.

**_Proven track record of synergetic acquisitions and well positioned for further consolidation in a_**
**_fragmented industry_**

We have a proven track record for successful and value-accretive acquisitions in a historically
fragmented market, completing eight selective and successful acquisitions since 2011. Our number of
client entities grew from approximately 40,000 at the end of 2015 to approximately 50,400 at the end of
2017, primarily as a result of strategic acquisitions. Our number of FTEs grew from approximately
1,700 at the end of 2015 to approximately 2,500 as of September 30, 2018, approximately 650 of
which were attributable to our strategic acquisitions. We aim to capture and diversify our service
offering and our strategic rationale is to further increase scale, provide complementary services,
expand our footprint and acquire technology enablers. For example, our acquisition of Elian in
September 2016 strengthened our capital markets, as well as our private equity and real estate fund
administration services, expanded our geographic presence to Jersey and added scale in other key
jurisdictions such as Ireland, the United Kingdom and the Cayman Islands.

We have instituted acquisition and integration procedures aimed at identifying and assessing
targets against clear strategic rationale and priorities, as well as potential risks and are selective
through strict criteria such as: revenue growth and profitability; potential to fit into and complement our
business; and quality of client portfolio. We have a robust internal M&A process framework in place
with oversight and final sign-off provided at the Parent Guarantor’s supervisory board (“Supervisory
**Board”) level and procedures for integration to ensure risk mitigation. Integration is focused on**
fostering organic growth and our aim is to retain services of key individuals and clients.

There are further opportunities for consolidation within the fragmented expert administrative
services market and we are in a strong position to source value-enhancing opportunities and extract
synergies given our global platform and wide-reaching in-jurisdiction presence, with a clear focus on
verticalization and expansion into selected new jurisdictions and regions such as the US and the Asia
Pacific region and expansion and diversification of our services in new and existing sectors such as
private equity and real estate fund administration, compliance services and capital markets.

**_Industry leading risk management standards_**

As a global player, we have enjoyed the reputation of applying high compliance and risk
management standards across our global network as the potential failure by us in this regard could
have a material adverse effect across our business. The responsibility for establishment and oversight
of our risk management framework lies within our management board (“Management Board”), but we
have also adopted a “three lines of defense” model to manage our risk:

_First line of defense—Business: Our business teams bear primary responsibility for identifying,_
controlling and monitoring the risks within their processes, maintaining effective internal control
frameworks and adhering to global compliance policies and standards.

_Second_ _line_ _of_ _defense—Compliance_ _and_ _Risk_ _Management:_ Our compliance and risk
management team (“Compliance and Risk Management team”) is globally responsible for
coordinating, developing and monitoring our risk management processes and adherence to
compliance standards and procedures. The Compliance and Risk Management team is responsible for
providing the independent risk reports to the executive committee (“Executive Committee”),
Supervisory Board and our audit and risk committee (“Audit and Risk Committee”). The Compliance
and Risk Management team also monitors changes that may impact the risk profile of the business and
whether it is appropriate to provide new services to existing clients. The Compliance and Risk
Management team further ensures that employees in every office receive compliance training, in
addition to the mandatory Group-wide e-learning courses on anti-money laundering (“AML”) and other
relevant topics.

_Third line of defense—Internal Audit: The independent internal audit team (“Internal Audit team”)_
conducts audits that provide insights into how and to what extent we control the risks that may
jeopardize our strategic and other objectives. These audits provide management with additional
assurance on the effectiveness of internal controls and risk management.

**_High margins and strong cash flow generation_**

Our business model has historically demonstrated consistently high and stable margins and is
highly cash generative, with Adjusted EBITDA margins of 40.3% for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2018, and 40.4%, 42.1% and 42.8% for the years ended December 2017, 2016 and
2015, respectively. Similarly, our Adjusted EBITA margins were 38.1% for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2018, and 38.2%, 39.9% and 40.7% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and
2015, respectively.

As a provider of expert administrative services, we have relatively limited requirements for capital
expenditure such as investment in property, plant and equipment. Since 2015, total capital expenditure
has been below 4% of revenue. Operational efficiencies are additionally supported by our continued
focus on and investment in our IT systems and technology foundation, for which we have reduced the
number of data centers in use and have enhanced the speed to market of new applications such as
client portals. We have low effective tax rates in our key markets (the Netherlands, Luxembourg, the
Cayman Islands and Jersey) and low net working capital requirements. As a result, we have strong
cash generation.

**_Experienced management team with a clear strategy, supported by dynamic and engaged talent_**
**_pool_**

The transition of our management team is now complete. Our management team benefits from an
average experience of approximately 20 years in the financial services industry and has implemented a
clear strategy focused on clients and services, innovation and technology and our people in order to
achieve operational excellence. In addition, our management was supported by a dynamic and
engaged global talent pool with more than 2,500 employees from 87 nationalities, as of September 30,
2018, the majority of whom have higher education degrees or qualifications. Our employees include
trained financial experts, lawyers, tax lawyers and accountants with 74.6% of employees in billable
FTE roles as of September 30, 2018.

We emphasize the importance of developing and maintaining our talent through strong teams,
creating platforms for personal and professional growth and a values-focused culture based on our four
key values: responsiveness; innovation; collaboration; and excellence. For example, we developed the
Global Mobility Program, in which we seek to support the international mobility of our staff with a view
to further developing the skillsets of our employees and further increasing cooperation, knowledge
sharing and cross-selling across our global network, and the Global Intertrust Academy, in which we
train and educate our employees on technical skills, as well as leadership, business development and
relationship management skills.

**OUR PURPOSE AND STRATEGY**

In an increasingly complex global environment, we help our clients with their administrative
challenges to grow and implement solutions to operate their business efficiently and responsibly.
Focusing on compliance, business ethics and transparency, we support our clients in fulfilling their
legal, administrative and regulatory duties in international business. We seek to consistently and
clearly communicate our strategy to ensure all stakeholders understand how we deliver value.

**_Capture opportunities to expand and diversify our service offering both organically and_**
**_through M&A activity_**

We seek opportunities to expand and diversify our service offering across all service lines in
existing and new jurisdictions. With a more complete service offering, we are able to target increased


6


-----

levels of cross-selling revenue from other service lines, and increased revenue for clients and entities
requiring more complex service requirements and substance. We recently created a global client
solutions team to further accelerate our services and product development as we aim to adapt to the
changing needs of our clients.

In our Corporates service line, we seek to grow and diversify our service offering primarily within
specialized services in existing jurisdictions. Identified growth areas include the development and
rollout of integrated office solutions (“IOS”) and global corporate secretarial (“CoSec”) solutions; the
rollout of our performance and reward management (“PRM”) services in other key jurisdictions of our
Rest of the World segment; growing our recruitment and payroll services; and expanding our global
footprint to new jurisdictions.

In our Funds service line, we see opportunities in existing and new geographies including
Luxembourg, Ireland, Spain, Jersey and the Americas. Key growth areas include expansion of private
equity and real estate fund administration; broadening our management company (“ManCo”) services
and fund services administration in Luxembourg and Ireland respectively; introducing outsourced
fiduciary services such as assisting the money laundering reporting officer (“MLRO”) and the money
laundering compliance officer (“MLCO”) of our clients with investor onboarding procedures; expanding
our compliance services, especially alternative investment fund managers (“AIFM”), AML and
customer due diligence (“CDD”) compliance; and leveraging our specialized sales force in the UK and
the US.

In our Capital Markets service line, we see the opportunity to offer domestic services in the US
and the Asia Pacific region; grow our debt capital market services in the US and in Europe; and
leverage our specialized sales force in the UK and the US.

In our Private Wealth service line, we see the opportunity to grow our ability to support family
offices with CoSec and accounting services; facilitate the globalization of multi-generational family
wealth and increase cross-selling towards our Corporates service line.

In addition to organic initiatives, we aim to increase our scale, complement our service offering,
expand our footprint and enhance our technology by pursuing selective and value enhancing
acquisitions. Over the past eight years, we have demonstrated our ability to identify, execute and
integrate acquisitions in the expert administrative services industry with the acquisitions of Close
Brothers Cayman, WMS, ATC, CRS, CorpNordic, Elian, SFM Spain and Azcona as well as Seed
Outsourcing. We intend to continue to take a disciplined and selective approach to pursue strategic
acquisitions and to apply a strict set of selection criteria when evaluating potential acquisition
candidates with a clear focus on strategic growth.

**_Develop our financial policy to serve our growth strategies_**

We intend to further strengthen and develop our financial policy in order to serve our growth
strategies and the expansion and diversification of our service offering. This includes targeting a net
leverage of approximately 3.0x in the absence of M&A. In terms of liquidity, we expect to have the
borrowings available under the New Revolving Credit Facility, and a minimum cash balance for
operations of €40 million. Under our dividend policy we expect to target a dividend payout of
approximately 40% of adjusted net income, with opportunistic share buy-backs subject to our net
leverage target. Under our M&A strategy we expect to continue to selectively pursue value accretive
acquisitions on the back of a strong M&A track record, and we intend to maintain a strong cash flow
profile supporting inorganic expansion. Under our hedging policy we intend to use interest rate swaps
for approximately 50% of our floating rate debt, with no foreign exchange hedging and an external debt
mix expected to reflect the foreign exchange mix in our Adjusted EBITDA.

**_Further develop our technology foundation to serve changing client needs_**

Our ambition is to further develop our technology foundation to serve client needs. We seek to
provide insight to clients through the consolidation of client data and empowering decision making. We
seek to enhance transparency, providing better and consistent oversight over activities, deadlines and


7


-----

regulatory changes. We seek to utilize automation to digitize client-facing processes and generate
efficiencies. We seek to provide control through managing risks and ensuring clients operate in a
compliant environment and with security of information. We seek to reap the benefits of new
technology—including regulatory technology (“RegTech”), client onboarding, robotic process
automation and blockchain—in a changing market and regulatory landscape.

Key Intertrust initiatives currently in development include the creation and deployment of a client
and payment portal, a virtual boardroom solution and self-service reporting solutions. These will enable
us to continue to develop as a technology enabled corporate and fund solutions provider.

**_Develop and maintain a dynamic and engaged global talent pool_**

We believe that the knowledge, local expertise and business relationships of our employees are
crucial to delivering high-quality services to our clients and generating new sustainable business. We
intend to continue to focus on attracting, developing and retaining the best talent in our industry. Our
talent strategy is centered on strong teams, platforms for growth and our values-driven culture.
Purpose-led and values-driven teams increase employee engagement, reinforce our strong brand and
positioning in the market and improve performance. To train our employees, we have developed
several platforms for personal and professional growth, such as the Global Mobility Program (in which
we seek to support the international mobility of our staff with a view to further developing the skillsets of
our employees and further increasing cooperation, knowledge sharing and cross-selling across our
global network), the Global Intertrust Academy (in which we train and educate our employees on
technical skills, as well as leadership, business development and relationship management skills),
“One Journey” (a program which aims to develop a positive workplace culture and environment as well
as an “Intertrust way” of working) and our Talent Program (a global talent development program which
offers a range of classes and assignments to develop leadership within the global business
environment).

**_Enable our strategic ambitions through best practice execution, including maintaining industry-_**
**_leading standards on compliance and risk management_**

To best execute our strategy, we adopt best practices including: global process standardization;
the creation of centers of excellence; and the outsourcing of certain business processes to nearby
countries to improve our customer service. The implementation of these strategies is underway and is
expected to support and enhance our Adjusted EBITDA margin and cash generation profile over the
medium term.

We believe that we are recognized by our clients and the business partners who refer new
business opportunities to us as having industry-leading standards on compliance and risk
management. We further believe that our strong relationships and ongoing dialogue with regulators to
discuss new legislative and regulatory developments and to promote best practice standards in relation
to compliance is expected to further improve the quality of our sector. We have four independent risk
monitoring functions: compliance and risk management; legal; tax; and internal audit. Our Compliance
and Risk Management team had approximately 55 FTEs as of September 30, 2018, including HQ and
local teams, and is responsible for developing and monitoring our compliance and risk management
processes and adherence to compliance and risk management standards and procedures. Our Internal
Audit team had two FTEs as of September 30, 2018 at HQ, and our Tax and Legal teams had three
and four FTEs at HQ as of September 30, 2018, respectively, not including local office teams. We
intend to maintain our high standards on compliance and continue to invest in our risk management
functions in order to support further sustainable growth of our business. To this effect, our Supervisory
Board is assisted by its Audit and Risk Committee, which is responsible for ensuring the proper
supervision on our compliance, risk management and audit functions. We believe that our clients value
our services and select us as their preferred expert administrative services provider in part because of
the high standards that we have consistently applied throughout our global network. This has made us
a reliable partner to whom clients can outsource certain of their activities on a global basis and in a
responsible manner.

**Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data**

_This section contains (i) historical consolidated financial information of our Group as of the dates_
_and for the periods indicated, which has been derived from the 2018 Interim Condensed Consolidated_
_Financial Statements and the Annual Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this_
_Offering Memorandum and (ii) certain other operational data._

_The financial information presented for the twelve months ended September 30, 2018 is derived_
_by adding the unaudited consolidated statement of profit and loss for the nine months ended_
_September 30, 2018 to the audited consolidated statement of profit and loss for the year ended_
_December 31, 2017 and deducting the unaudited consolidated statement of profit and loss for the nine_
_months ended September 30, 2017. The consolidated statement of profit and loss for the twelve_
_months ended September 30, 2018 has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and is not_
_necessarily representative of the Group’s results of operations for any future period or the Group’s_
_financial condition at any future date. The consolidated statement of profit and loss for the twelve_
_months ended September 30, 2018 is not prepared in the ordinary course of our financial reporting or_
_in accordance with IFRS._

_We also present several KPIs, including Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITA. None of these_
_KPIs is a measure of financial performance under IFRS. Nevertheless, we believe that these measures_
_provide an important indication of trends in our financial performance, our financial condition and our_
_results of operations. Furthermore, we believe that these KPIs are widely used by certain investors,_
_securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and_
_liquidity. However, there are limitations inherent to the use of KPIs resulting from the fact that they_
_exclude expenses and other items that are required to be included in corresponding measures under_
_IFRS. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information.”_

_Also presented below are certain unaudited pro forma financial information and adjustments,_
_which have been prepared for illustrative purposes only. Because of their nature, the pro forma_
_financial information and adjustments address hypothetical situations and, therefore, do not represent_
_our actual financial condition or results of operations for the periods presented or as of the presented_
_dates. Pro forma adjustments are based on available information and certain assumptions and_
_estimates that we believe are reasonable in the circumstances. However, these assumptions and_
_estimates are inherently uncertain, subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic and_
_other risks and may differ materially from our actual financial condition or results of operations. The pro_
_forma adjustments presented below are directly attributable to the Transactions, thereby giving effect_
_to the Transactions as if the Transactions had occurred on September 30, 2018._

_This section should be read in conjunction with the information contained under “Presentation of_
_Financial and Other Information,” “Capitalization,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial_
_Condition and Results of Operations,” the 2018 Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements,_
_including the notes thereto, and the Annual Consolidated Financial Statements, including the notes_
_thereto, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum and other financial data appearing_
_elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risk_
_factors described below and all other information contained and incorporated by reference in this_
_Offering Memorandum. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face. We also face_
_additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently consider_
_immaterial. The occurrence of the risks described below or such additional risks could have a material_
_adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations,_
_and could affect our ability to meet our obligations, including our ability to make payments on the_
_Notes. Furthermore, before making an investment decision with respect to any Notes, prospective_
_investors should consult their financial, legal and tax advisors and consider such an investment_
_decision in light of their personal circumstances._

_This Offering Memorandum contains forward-looking statements based on assumptions that_
_involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those that we discuss in these_
_forward-looking statements. Investors should read “Forward-Looking Statements” for a discussion of_
_the risks and uncertainties related to those statements._

**RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY**

**_The loss of certain employees, the failure to attract and retain employees with appropriate_**
**_qualifications, experience and business relationships, or the increase of personnel expenses_**
**_could have a material adverse effect on our business._**

Our business, future growth and success depend to a large extent on the experience, knowledge
and business relationships of our client facing employees. In particular, their knowledge of local
markets and their long-standing client and business partner relationships are extremely valuable to our
business. Our employees may decide to leave us and join our competitors or pursue independent
business opportunities.

Competition in our industry for suitably qualified employees is intense and is expected to further
intensify. The loss of client facing employees, particularly to our competitors, has in the past and may
in the future result in us losing clients with whom such employees have business relationships.
Although we believe our clients generally choose to work with us as a company, in the event that
certain employees leave us, clients may decide to follow and continue working with such employees
rather than with us. In addition, if we were to lose a substantial number of our client facing employees,
we would have to incur significant costs in identifying, hiring, training and retaining replacements for
such departing employees. From time to time our industry is confronted with a shortage of suitably
qualified personnel in certain regions. Such shortages have in the past limited, and may in the future
limit, our ability to attract employees to operate and further grow our business.

In addition, salaries and related benefits of our employees are among our most significant costs.
As a result, wage, salary and related benefit increases, due to labor shortages or other reasons, can
have a significant impact on our operating profits, in particular if we are unable to pass on increased
costs to our clients.

Our future growth and success also depend upon the leadership and performance of the members
of our management team, many of whom have significant experience in the expert administrative
services sector in which we operate and could be difficult to replace. We may lose members of our
management team and be unable to replace such members in a timely manner.

The materialization of any or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our
business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations, and could affect our
ability to meet our obligations, including our ability to make payments on the Notes.

**_As a provider of expert administrative services, we operate in a litigation sensitive environment_**
**_and are susceptible to litigation and claims._**

We provide expert administrative services to our clients and operate in a litigation sensitive
environment. We currently are, and expect that we will from time to time continue to be, involved in

22


-----

litigation related to our business. For a summary of our current material legal and arbitration
proceedings, see “Business—Legal and Arbitration Proceedings.” The claims we typically face usually
allege breach of directors’ or trustees’ fiduciary duties, fraud, misappropriation of funds, willful
misconduct, gross negligence, negligence or breach of contract. Our contracts with clients typically
require us to perform our services in accordance with certain standards and requirements. If our
services fall short of these agreed standards or requirements, we may be subject to claims by our
clients for damages that could be substantial depending on the nature of the matter. For example, we
have been and may continue to be subject to claims relating to the late filing of tax returns, financial
reports and other regulatory filings. We and client entities, structures and vehicles to which we render
expert administrative services (including directorships and trustee services) have also been and may
continue to be subject to other claims and judicial, administrative, tax and criminal proceedings
incurred in the course of our operations, including fraud and tort claims. For example, if investors in
assets held through structures and vehicles to which we render services lose part or all of their
investment, such investors (as well as liquidators and counterparties of those structures and vehicles)
may seek to recover losses from service providers involved with the relevant structure or vehicle. This
may include us, under the assumption that we may have contributed to the losses of such entity or
failed to comply with our legal duties or obligations. Our risk of becoming subject to such claims or
litigation increases if the relevant client entity is or becomes unable to meet its financial or other
obligations. Consequently, we have been and continue to be subject to claims where we acted as
administrator, trustee or director of investment, holding, financing, fund or other structures and
vehicles. Some of those claims seek damages for the entire amount of the underlying investment plus
damages, which may be very substantial. A negative outcome of any material pending or future
proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition. Furthermore, responding to and defending claims can be expensive and time consuming,
and can result in a diversion of management resources.

As of September 30, 2018, our business operated with 2,532 FTEs in 29 jurisdictions, each with
different laws, practices, standards and regulations. Our employees may in the course of providing
services to our clients or otherwise expose us to risks and liabilities. As part of our business, our
employees act as trustees or directors of corporate entities of our clients, including entities formed to
administer significant investments or assets. We are currently and have in the past been subject to
claims based upon the actions or failures to act of our employees when acting as trustees or directors
of corporate entities or trusts of our clients, and we typically indemnify our employees for claims
against them in such capacity, except in the event of fraud or willful misconduct. Accordingly, actions of
our employees, particularly when acting as directors or trustees of corporate entities or trusts of clients,
could expose us to significant liability which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, we may also suffer reputational harm should
an employee act inappropriately while representing us. In addition, fiduciary duties of directors and
trustees are increasing and standards governing those duties are becoming increasingly strict in the
jurisdictions in which we operate, which increases the likelihood that we can successfully be held liable
for a breach of directors’ or trustees’ fiduciary duties. Consequently, our involvement in litigation or
potential litigation may increase beyond current or historical levels. This may result in increased
exposure to claims and liabilities, and an increase in our legal and regulatory costs and insurance
premiums.

We also rely in certain jurisdictions to a limited extent upon our business and joint venture
partners. We may experience incidents of our business or joint venture partners not complying with our
policies, committing fraud or breaching local or national law and regulations. Any of these issues may
result in litigation, regulatory consequences or reputational damage, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations,
and could affect our ability to meet our obligations, including our ability to make payments on the
Notes.

We have no material provisions for legal matters and as a result we may incur substantially more
costs and expenses associated with defending claims, and may be required to increase our provisions
for litigation liabilities as a result of new developments in ongoing litigation proceedings and the
commencement of new litigation proceedings. We also have no material provisions for any fines or
other penalties should any such fines or penalties result from any such investigations or proceedings.

23


-----

Any significant judgment against us or other liabilities incurred by us may not be adequately
covered by the indemnities we generally receive from our clients under our client contracts. In addition,
we may incur liabilities or expenses in excess of our insurance coverage, outside of the scope of our
insurance coverage or subject to substantial insurance deductibles. Litigation can also lead to
regulatory investigation, criminal proceedings and other scrutiny, and could adversely affect our
reputation. Litigation proceedings and the outcome thereof may adversely affect the continuity of our
business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition,
cash flows and results of operations, and could affect our ability to meet our obligations, including our
ability to make payments on the Notes.

**_A significant change in the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which our clients_**
**_operate or where client entities are domiciled, particularly any unfavorable amendments to_**
**_corporate and tax laws and regulations and double tax treaties, may have an adverse effect on_**
**_our business._**

Many of our clients invest through or utilize tax efficient holding, investment and finance structures
in jurisdictions that have efficient, flexible and relatively stable corporate and tax law frameworks, as
well as extensive double tax treaty networks, such as the Netherlands and Luxembourg. As a result, a
large portion of our revenue is generated from expert administrative services that we provide in such
jurisdictions. Revenue generated in the Netherlands and Luxembourg for the year ended
December 31, 2017 was €117.2 million and €97.1 million respectively, which together represented
44% of total revenue for the period. The consolidated Adjusted EBITA generated in the Netherlands
and Luxembourg for the year ended December 31, 2017 was €123.4 million, representing 67% of total
Adjusted EBITA for the period. Any amendment to or the termination of favorable corporate and tax
laws and regulations or double tax treaties of these jurisdictions or the ways in which they are
interpreted or compliance with them is scrutinized or enforced (for instance as a result of BEPS or
ATAD), could make the jurisdictions in which we operate our business less attractive or impossible for
holding, investment or finance structures. In this respect we note that a motion was submitted by
members of the Dutch Parliament requesting the Dutch government to explore possibilities for making
it impossible for the Dutch trust sector, of which we are part, to provide domiciliation services to conduit
companies and letterbox companies. This in turn could deter our clients from investing through or
utilizing such jurisdictions and decrease significantly the need for our services, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of
operations, and could affect our ability to meet our obligations, including our ability to make payments
on the Notes.

The ongoing global, regional and local political pressure to reduce tax avoidance and measures to
prevent tax evasion, fraud and terrorist financing have resulted in greater complexity and increased
regulation. Relevant developments to reform international tax rules, double tax treaties and regulations
(with respect to, among other things, the international exchange of information, substance
requirements, anti-abuse rules and transfer pricing rules) include:

    - the BEPS measures as developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and
Development (“OECD”) and supported by the G20 (the “Group of Twenty” of the world’s
largest advanced and emerging economies), which aims, among other things, to equip
governments with domestic and international instruments to address tax avoidance, ensuring
that profits are taxed where economic activities generating the profits are performed and
where value is created;

    - the Multilateral Instrument (“MLI”), which transposes the results of BEPS into bilateral tax
treaties worldwide and which implements in such tax treaties agreed minimum standards to
counter treaty abuse and to improve dispute resolution mechanisms;

    - ATAD, which implements the anti-BEPS measures at the level of the EU, and which provides
for limitations to the deductibility of interest, exit taxation, a general anti-abuse rule, controlled
foreign company rules and rules to tackle hybrid mismatch arrangements;

    - the amended EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive, which requires the member states of the EU
(“Member States”) to include in their domestic legislation provisions against hybrid financing

24


-----

arrangements and to implement a general anti-abuse rule, pursuant to which the benefits of
the directive are withheld in case of artificial structures; and

    - the Mandatory Disclosure Directive (“DAC 6”), which requires intermediaries (including us,
under certain circumstances) or taxpayers themselves to report cross-border tax planning
structures that meet certain criteria, to the tax authorities in their Member State of residence.

The precise interpretation and implementation by local governments and local tax authorities of
such reforms, and the abovementioned developments in particular, are not yet fully known, making the
full impact thereof still uncertain. However, these reforms to the international tax rules, double tax
treaties and regulations may impact the way in which our clients conduct their business operations,
and setup and organize their corporate structures. If such impact turns out to be significant, the
demand for our services could decrease significantly which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations, and could affect our
ability to meet our obligations, including our ability to make payments on the Notes.

**_Certain prospective amendments to double tax treaties may have an adverse effect on our_**
**_business._**

The MLI aims to implement the outcome of BEPS actions 2 (hybrid mismatches), 6 (treaty abuse),
7 (avoidance of permanent establishment status), and 14 (dispute resolution) in more than 3,000
bilateral tax treaties currently in force worldwide. Consequently, bilateral tax treaties covered by the
MLI may be amended to provide, among other things, for a denial of treaty benefits in respect of
certain hybrid mismatches, the inclusion of a principal purpose test and provisions to counter the
artificial avoidance of permanent establishments. Pursuant to the aforementioned principal purpose
test, the benefits of double tax treaties may be denied in situations where it is reasonable to conclude
that one of the principal purposes of an arrangement or transaction was for such benefit to be
obtained. As a result thereof, certain holding, investment and finance structures may going forward no
longer qualify for the benefits of applicable bilateral tax treaties, which may impact the way in which our
clients conduct their business operations, and setup and organize their corporate structures. If such
impact turns out to be significant, the demand for our services could decrease significantly which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results
of operations, and could affect our ability to meet our obligations, including our ability to make
payments on the Notes.

**_We operate in a competitive market and if we are unable to compete effectively, retain our_**
**_existing clients, provide additional or new services to our existing clients, or attract new_**
**_clients, our market share, profitability and revenue could be materially and adversely impacted._**

We face competition in providing services to our clients. The extent of such competition varies by
service line, geography and competitors’ capabilities. For more information on our competitive
environment, see “Industry.” If we are unable to compete effectively in our markets, our market share,
profitability and revenue could be negatively impacted which could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to compete effectively is
dependent on, among other things, the quality, pricing and perceived value of our service offerings, our
reputation, our ability to attract and retain clients as well as our ability to introduce new and sell
additional services to our clients. In each of the jurisdictions in which we are active, we may face
increased competition from global competitors and from local or regional competitors in relation to
certain services they offer, particularly if there is further consolidation of regional or local markets which
may result in stronger competitors with a broader service offering compared with ours.

In connection with acquisitions, we have in the past and may in the future obtain non-competition
or non-solicitation agreements from the parties who sell us their business. Such non-competition and
non-solicitation agreements have generally ranged from two to three years from the date of the
acquisition and have been limited in geographic scope and in the activities such acquired businesses
cover. Such non-competition and non-solicitation agreements may not always be effective or
enforceable and typically have limited duration. Furthermore, certain activities may be carved out of, or
otherwise may not be prohibited by, these arrangements. We cannot assure that one or more of the

25


-----

parties from whom we acquire or have acquired a business will not compete with us or solicit our
employees or clients in the future. Such parties, because they have a historic relationship with the
employees and clients of the business they sold to us, may be able to compete more effectively with
us, or be more successful in soliciting our employees and clients, than other competitors.

Some of our competitors have strong and long standing relationships with clients and persons who
may serve as references for new work which may make it difficult to gain market share from such
competitors. In addition, other service providers, such as law firms, banks and accounting firms, have
in the past started, and may in the future start, competing with us and offer the services we provide
themselves. As a result of such competition we may not only lose business and market share to such
new entrants, but we also no longer benefit from the referral of business that we strive to receive from
these other service providers. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully
against future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not materially adversely affect
us. In particular, as we believe our clients prefer to work with a global service provider that can offer an
integrated comprehensive set of expert administrative services, the emergence of further such global
players, whether as a result of consolidation in the industry, new market entrants or otherwise, could
materially adversely affect us. Any increase in competition generally or as a result of further
consolidation by our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets,
financial condition, cash flows and results of operations, and could affect our ability to meet our
obligations, including our ability to make payments on the Notes.

**_We are subject to laws and regulations relating to the expert administrative services industry in_**
**_which we operate, the impact of ongoing global and regional regulatory reform, and to_**
**_supervision by a number of regulatory authorities, and compliance with regulations may trigger_**
**_costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and_**
**_financial condition._**

We are subject to expert administrative services laws and regulations, and to supervision by
regulatory authorities that have administrative power over us in most of the jurisdictions in which we
operate. See “Regulation.” The laws and regulations to which we are subject are expected to become
increasingly complex. Regulators are therefore expected to exert increased scrutiny on the industry in
which we operate. For example, 2017 saw increasingly stringent regulation in the Netherlands by the
Dutch Central Bank, increased demand for transparency and increased compliance costs for
corporate, fund, capital markets and private wealth service providers. Furthermore, the federal
government in the US has pursued policy changes and regulatory reform across multiple areas,
including tax, immigration and international trade. For instance the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was
signed into law on December 22, 2017, could disincentive US entities to set up international structures.
This may place an increasing burden on our resources and employees. Regulations to which we are or
may become subject, may limit our activities and may negatively impact our ability to make
autonomous decisions in relation to our operations and business. This in turn may limit our ability to
implement our strategy and further grow our business.

Compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time-consuming and personnel-intensive.
Further changes in laws and regulations have increased and may continue to increase. Consequently,
the cost of compliance is substantial and is expected to increase. Our compliance procedures may be
found to be inadequate or otherwise ineffective in ensuring compliance with applicable laws and
regulations, including as a result of human or operational errors in their implementation. Failure to
comply with any applicable laws and regulations has in the past and may in the future subject us to
administrative penalties and other measures imposed by governmental or regulatory authorities. This
could lead to financial penalties, unanticipated costs associated with remedying such failures and
adverse publicity, and could harm our reputation, cause temporary interruption of operations, and could
result in revocation or temporary suspension of our licenses. If we were to lose any of our regulatory
licenses in a particular jurisdiction or if any such licenses were to be suspended, we would not be able
to continue to offer all or certain of our services in the relevant jurisdiction. If we were to lose the ability
to offer all or certain of our services in a particular jurisdiction, we may lose business from clients that
require us to provide an integrated service offering to them across a number of jurisdictions.

In most of the regulated jurisdictions, our key employees are subject to increased scrutiny by
regulators. If their conduct is deemed to violate applicable law, this may have implications for their

26


-----

involvement in our business, including that they may no longer be considered fit or qualified to hold
their position within our business operations.

The continuing introduction of new global and regional regulations could significantly impact the
demand for our services and the manner in which we operate and could materially and adversely affect
our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although the impact of these regulatory
initiatives cannot be determined, their requirements could have material adverse consequences for the
industry in which we operate, including for us.

The materialization of any or all of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our
business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations, and could affect our
ability to meet our obligations, including our ability to make payments on the Notes.

**_Any damage to our business reputation or brand could have a material adverse effect on our_**
**_business, results of operations and financial condition._**

Our business is dependent on our reputation and well-established brand. We rely on our
relationships with our current and prospective clients, business referrers, the investment management
and financial services communities and the industries that these entities and people serve. Any
damage to our reputation or brand, whether arising from litigation, regulatory, tax, supervisory, criminal
or enforcement actions or from lack of compliance with regulatory or administrative rules and
regulations, negative publicity (such as the current international debate on tax avoidance) or otherwise,
could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain new business and retain existing clients. In
particular, we believe that since one of the reasons our clients choose to work with us is because of
our reputation for applying high compliance and risk management standards across our global
network, any failure by us in this regard could have a material adverse effect on us across our
business. In addition, if one of our clients were to suffer reputational damage due to improper or illegal
behavior, a criminal, regulatory, tax or other investigation, or otherwise, our business reputation could
be consequently damaged as a result of us providing services to such client, including in our capacity
as director or trustee of a client entity. Any damage to our reputation or brand as a result of any of the
foregoing or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial
condition, cash flows and results of operations, and could affect our ability to meet our obligations,
including our ability to make payments on the Notes.

**_Failures or disruptions in our IT and other operational systems could have a material adverse_**
**_effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition._**

We rely on IT and other operational systems to ensure that our network of 41 offices in
29 jurisdictions as of September 30, 2018, remains connected and to provide an integrated services
offering to our clients across jurisdictions. We could experience a failure of our systems, our
employees could fail to monitor and implement enhancements or other modifications to a system in a
timely and effective manner, or our employees could fail to complete all necessary data reconciliation
or other conversion controls when implementing new software systems or implementing modifications
to existing systems. We rely heavily on the services of one IT supplier which provides one of our new
core IT applications. If this IT supplier or other IT suppliers were to fail in their delivery of IT services to
us, this could have a material adverse effect on our ability to run our business and service the needs of
our clients. For more information on IT and operational systems, see “Business—Information
_Technology.” We continuously review the sourcing strategy of our IT systems and may from time to_
time decide to insource or outsource certain parts of our IT systems. Any such changes in the sourcing
of our IT systems may lead to disruptions to those systems. Furthermore, we may be subject to
disruptions of our IT systems and applications arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond
our control, such as loss of connectivity of our IT and other operational systems, computer viruses,
cyber-based attacks and attempts by hackers and similar unauthorized users to gain access to or
corrupt our IT systems, and electrical or telecommunications outages. Our network security measures
and business continuity plans may fail to prevent disruptions to our IT systems caused by such events
or to re-install our IT systems after the occurrence of such disruptions. Further, there can be no
assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate the IT systems of acquired companies in a
timely manner, if at all. Similarly, rising IT costs could prevent us from implementing all necessary

27


-----

modifications to our existing systems, or from implementing new systems. Each of the foregoing
factors may have a significant effect on our ability to service the needs of our clients and could have a
material adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of
operations, and could affect our ability to meet our obligations, including our ability to make payments
on the Notes.

**_We rely on our insurance coverage, in particular our outside directors’ and officers’ insurance_**
**_and professional indemnity insurance and we may be unable to obtain or maintain such_**
**_coverage in the future, such coverage may prove to be inadequate and we may have disputes_**
**_with our insurers._**

We maintain insurance coverage against certain business and other risks. However, some of the
risks related to our business may not be adequately covered by our insurance policies or may not be
covered at all. In addition, our insurance policies have deductibles, coverage exclusions (including with
respect to fraud, negligence and misconduct) and maximum levels of recovery. Consequently, we may
not be adequately insured against all types of risks that are associated with the conduct of our
business. We are in particular exposed to risks of claims made against us and our directors, officers
and employees. Such claims could involve those made by our clients due to, for example, losses
incurred as a result of declines in fund assets administered by us, losses in investment, holding,
financing, fund or other structures or structured finance transactions administered by an entity
incorporated by us or managed by us. In such circumstances, third parties could bring claims against
us and our directors, officers and employees. Any liability incurred by us as a consequence of such
claims may not be covered by our insurance policies, may exceed our insurance coverage, or may be
subject to a substantial deductible. Additionally, any claims made under an insurance policy potentially
limit the maximum amount of insurance coverage for us in the future and may increase our insurance
premiums. The maximum amount recoverable under our insurance policies is typically calculated on an
aggregate annual basis. Therefore, any claim against our insurance policies reduces our potential
recovery for all such claims made in the same year. We may not be able to, or may choose not to,
obtain or maintain insurance coverage for certain potential losses, claims or litigation that we are
exposed to. If we are unable to obtain insurance at an acceptable cost or otherwise protect against
potential claims, we will be exposed to significant potential liabilities. A successful claim brought
against us in excess of, or a successful claim excluded from, our insurance coverage could have a
material adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of
operations, and could affect our ability to meet our obligations, including our ability to make payments
on the Notes.

We may have disputes with our insurers regarding issues such as the level of deductible for a
particular loss or claim, what insurance policy a particular claim or potential claim may fall under and
whether a particular loss, claim or potential claim is covered by the insurance policy. We may be
materially adversely affected as a result of any such dispute as we may be uninsured for a particular
claim or ultimately be exposed to greater liability to the underlying litigation or circumstances as a
result of a dispute with our insurers. Even if a loss, liability or claim is covered by one of our insurance
policies, a substantial period of time may elapse between the date on which we are required to pay out
with respect to such loss, liability or claim and the date on which we are reimbursed under the relevant
insurance policy which could have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial
condition, cash flows and results of operations, and could affect our ability to meet our obligations,
including our ability to make payments on the Notes.

**_If we are not able to develop and implement new initiatives successfully, our business and_**
**_profitability could be harmed._**

Our profitability and growth depend on the successful implementation of our business strategy and
initiatives. We have recently launched new initiatives, including technological developments such as
client portals and self-service reporting solutions, as part of our plan to develop our technology
foundation to serve changing client needs, as well as an initiative to outsource certain business
processes to nearby countries to improve our customer service. The development of such initiatives
can be a time-consuming and expensive process. See “Business—Our Strategy.” If our initiatives are
not well received by our clients and employees, they may not have the intended effect of improving our

28


-----

client services and growing our business in the future. We may not be able to recover the costs
incurred in developing our technology or other development projects and initiatives or to realize their
intended or projected benefits, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets,
financial condition, cash flows and results of operations, and could affect our ability to meet our
obligations, including our ability to make payments on the Notes.

**_We are exposed to a variety of economic, legal, tax and other related risks due to the_**
**_international nature of our business._**

As of September 30, 2018, we provided our services to clients through various subsidiaries in 29
different jurisdictions. Accordingly, our business is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political,
social and economic conditions of many jurisdictions. Risks inherent in international operations include
the following:

    - difficulties obtaining or renewing permits and governmental approvals;

    - risks related to inadvertently providing services or undertaking activities in jurisdictions without
all of the requisite regulatory consents or required consents, exposing us to fines and
sanctions;

    - exposure to different legal standards;

    - exposure to political risk;

    - risk of imposition or increase of withholding or other taxes or tariffs, changes to tax treaties, or
of the adoption of other restrictions on trade or investment, including currency exchange
controls;

    - fluctuations in exchange rates may adversely affect the profitability in euro of services
provided by us in markets where payments for our services are made in the local currency;

    - difficulties in collecting amounts payable to us under our contracts and enforcing agreements,
in particular if our clients undergo financial difficulties;

    - general economic conditions in the countries in which we operate, including but not limited to
uncertainties surrounding the Dutch fiscal climate; and

    - changes in market conditions, especially in developing markets, as a result of economic or
social instability or other developments not typical in more developed markets, and other
difficulties typically associated with operating in developing markets.

Although we have a widespread network of offices, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, the Americas
and Jersey represented 74.1% of our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
Consequently, if any of the abovementioned risks were to materialize in any of these jurisdictions in
particular, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely
affected. More generally, our overall success as a multinational business depends, in part, upon our
ability to succeed in differing legal, regulatory, economic, social and political conditions. Accordingly, if
we fail to adequately address any of the foregoing factors, this could have a material adverse effect on
our business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations, and could affect our
ability to meet our obligations, including our ability to make payments on the Notes.

**_Failure of our KYC controls or compliance function could result in our representation of clients_**
**_that may subject us to reputational damage, penalties and other regulatory action._**

If a quality control issue or fraud in the checking of our clients or the monitoring of our clients’
transactions occurs or if our compliance function does not function adequately, we may be exposed to
significant reputational, business, legal and regulatory risks, including the loss of required regulatory
licenses, decrease in fees, or civil and criminal fines. These risks and any resulting penalties could be
substantial, particularly if we engage with one or more clients that are on US, United Nations, EU or
other sanction lists or clients whose ultimate beneficial owners are associated with undesirable or
criminal activities, and such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets,
financial condition, cash flows and results of operations, and could affect our ability to meet our
obligations, including our ability to make payments on the Notes.

**_A significant reduction in foreign direct investment could have a material adverse effect on our_**
**_business._**

The general global level of foreign direct investment has a significant impact on demand for our
services since such investment is often structured through fund, holding, investment, finance and other
vehicles and structures which are serviced by expert administrative service providers such as us.
Foreign direct investment can be driven by a large number of macro-economic and jurisdiction specific
factors, including local regulatory regimes, exchange controls, governments taking local protectionist
actions or changes in a jurisdiction’s double tax treaty network (for instance as a result of the MLI; see
“Risk Factors—Certain prospective amendments to double tax treaties may have an adverse effect on
_our business.”). For example, the recent US tax reform moves from a worldwide to a territorial taxation_
system and reduces the corporate tax rate. This disincentives US corporate clients from structuring
through foreign entities, and clients may restructure or repatriate funds to the US Additionally, changes
in trade relations arising from policy initiatives implemented by the current US administration, which
has been critical of existing and proposed trade agreements, and the retaliatory measures
implemented in third countries may cause economic uncertainty and reduce levels of foreign direct
investment. A significant shift or reduction in the level of foreign direct investment could have a material
adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations,
and could affect our ability to meet our obligations, including our ability to make payments on the
Notes.

**_A prolonged or significant economic downturn or a significant reduction of cross-border M&A,_**
**_capital markets or hedge fund activity may adversely affect our business, results of operations_**
**_and financial condition._**

A prolonged or significant economic downturn or a significant reduction of M&A (in particular
cross-border M&A), capital markets or hedge fund activity could result in a significant decline in
demand for our services. A global or significant regional economic downturn or recession could harm
us by adversely affecting our clients’ and our prospective clients’ access to capital to fund their
businesses and their ability to sustain and grow their businesses, particularly their ability to expand
internationally. Such events could result in a significant decline in demand for our services and could
have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results
of operations, and could affect our ability to meet our obligations, including our ability to make
payments on the Notes.

**_Economic conditions and regulatory changes that may result from the UK’s likely exit from the_**
**_EU could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations._**

In June 2016, the UK held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the EU, commonly
referred to as “Brexit.” The announcement of Brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets
and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the US dollar against
foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The announcement of Brexit and likely withdrawal of
the UK from the EU may also create further global economic uncertainty, which could particularly
impact our British clients and our Jersey business but also reduce foreign direct investment within the
EU and globally.

Brexit will require negotiations regarding the future terms of the UK’s relationship with the EU,
which could result in the UK losing access to certain aspects of the single EU market and the global
trade deals negotiated by the EU on behalf of its members. On March 29, 2017, the UK gave formal
notice of its intention to leave the EU. This notice has triggered the process of negotiating the UK’s
exit, which will occur two years from that date, unless the deadline is extended or a withdrawal
agreement is negotiated sooner. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear how Brexit may
negatively impact the economies of the UK, the EU countries and other nations. Brexit and the
perceptions as to the impact of the withdrawal of the UK may adversely affect business activity,
political stability and economic conditions in the UK, the EU and elsewhere, the impact of which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results
of operations, and could affect our ability to meet our obligations, including our ability to make
payments on the Notes.

**_Our clients may seek to conduct the services we provide in-house, which would lead to a_**
**_decline in the demand for our services._**

Clients who currently retain our business services may for various reasons seek to bring certain or
all of those services in-house. Clients may establish a sufficiently large presence in a jurisdiction in
which they operate and may want certain or all functions of their operations carried out in-house by
their own employees. If this were to occur, it could lead to a decline in demand for our services which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and
results of operations, and could affect our ability to meet our obligations, including our ability to make
payments on the Notes.

**_In connection with acquisitions, we may have inadvertently acquired and may in the future_**
**_inadvertently acquire actual or potential liabilities._**

Since January 1, 2015, we have completed two material acquisitions, Elian and SFM Spain, and
we completed two smaller acquisitions, CorpNordic and Seed Outsourcing. We expect to continue to
expand our business through future acquisitions. We may have acquired, and we may continue to
acquire, actual or potential liabilities in connection with acquisitions, including tort claims, claims or
penalties as a result of breach of applicable laws or regulations, claims for breach of contract, claims
for breach of fiduciary duties, employment-related claims or tax liabilities. Any due diligence that we
perform on potential acquisition candidates is limited due to the confidential nature of the business of
potential acquisition candidates and due to the number of clients that such acquisition candidates tend
to service. Although acquisition agreements may include indemnities in our favor, these indemnities
might not always be enforceable, might expire, might be limited in amount or we may have disputes
with the sellers regarding their enforceability or scope. If any acquired liabilities are not adequately
covered by an applicable and enforceable indemnity, keep well, guarantee or similar agreement from a
creditworthy counterparty, we will be exposed to these liabilities. Such liabilities, if they materialize,
could have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and
results of operations, and could affect our ability to meet our obligations, including our ability to make
payments on the Notes.

**_We might be unable to successfully integrate or achieve the expected benefits from past or_**
**_future acquisitions. Undertaking acquisitions increases the risk profile of our business._**

We might not achieve the competitive advantage, increased market share, revenue growth
through cross-selling efforts, cost savings, synergies or other benefits that we expect to achieve from
past or future acquisitions. We cannot guarantee that the ongoing integration of acquired operations or
the integration of any future acquisitions will generate benefits to us that are sufficient to justify the
expenses we incurred or will incur in completing such acquisitions. Furthermore, acquisitions and
investments involve risks, including as a result of inaccurate assumptions about revenue, costs,
liabilities, expected synergies and the costs of equity or debt financing, lack of management control
over the newly acquired business, client or key employee losses at the acquired businesses, and
failures to successfully integrate the operational, IT, compliance and other systems of the newly
acquired business with those of our business. In addition, undertaking acquisitions and investments is
costly and diverts management and other resources from running our day-to-day business. These
risks, if they materialize, could have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial
condition, cash flows and results of operations, and could affect our ability to meet our obligations,
including our ability to make payments on the Notes.

**_We may fail to identify or acquire suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities or_**
**_make unsuitable acquisitions or investments, which could impair our ability to achieve our_**
**_strategic objectives._**

Growth through acquisitions is an important element of our strategy. The execution of our strategy
requires the continued pursuit of acquisitions and investments and will depend on our ability to identify
suitable acquisition candidates and investment opportunities. We cannot guarantee that we will be able
to identify and acquire, on reasonable terms, if at all, suitable acquisition candidates or investment
opportunities or that we will be able to obtain the necessary funding on acceptable terms, if at all, to

31


-----

finance any of those potential acquisitions or investments. In addition, even where we are able to
complete an acquisition or an investment, we cannot guarantee that such acquired entity, business or
asset or such investment will perform in line with our assumptions or expectations or otherwise
complement our business or strategy. With continuing concentration being a likely industry trend, we
could be faced with increasing competition for attractive acquisition candidates. Failure to identify or
acquire suitable candidates or investment opportunities or the acquisition of unsuitable candidates or
the making of unsuitable investments could impair our ability to achieve our strategic objectives.
Furthermore, failure to successfully participate in any ongoing consolidation in our industry could
potentially put us at a competitive disadvantage with respect to scale, resources and our ability to
retain and acquire clients. Finally, compliance with antitrust laws or other rules and regulations may
delay proposed acquisitions or investments or prevent us from closing acquisitions or investments in
the manner proposed, if at all. Each of these risks, should they materialize, could limit our potential to
further grow our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets,
financial condition, cash flows and results of operations, and could affect our ability to meet our
obligations, including our ability to make payments on the Notes.

**_Our inability to raise capital could affect our ability to execute our strategic plans._**

Growth through acquisitions is an important element of our strategy. See “Business—Our
_Strategy.” Acquisitions may be executed within a short timeframe, may occur at any time and may be_
significant in size relative to our existing assets and operations. We may not generate sufficient cash
flow to finance such acquisitions. Consequently, the execution of our growth strategy may require
access to external sources of capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.
Limitations on our access to capital, including on our ability to issue additional debt or equity, could
result from events or causes beyond our control, and could include, among other factors, decreases in
our creditworthiness or profitability, significant increases in interest rates, increases in the risk premium
generally required by investors, decreases in the availability of credit or the tightening of terms required
by lenders. Any limitations on our ability to secure external capital, continue our existing finance
arrangements or refinance existing financing obligations could limit our liquidity, our financial flexibility
or our cash flows and affect our ability to execute our strategic plans, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations,
and could affect our ability to meet our obligations, including our ability to make payments on the
Notes.

**_Improper disclosure of sensitive data or data protected by data protection laws could result in_**
**_liability and harm our reputation._**

As part of our service offerings, we handle and process large amounts of sensitive or confidential
information of our clients and other parties much of which is protected by data protection laws. Our
security controls over personal data, the training of our employees and partners on data security, and
other practices and procedures we follow may fail to prevent the improper disclosure of such sensitive
information in breach of applicable laws or contracts. In addition, we retain confidential information in
our IT systems. Any compromise of the security of our IT systems could result in unauthorized
disclosure or use of sensitive or confidential information of our clients and other parties. Any improper
disclosure of this information could harm our reputation, lead to legal action against us and our clients
or subject us to liability under laws that protect data, resulting in increased costs and loss of revenue.

The Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on
the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free
movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (the
“GDPR”) became effective on May 25, 2018, replacing the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC. The
GDPR provides for more significant forfeitures and penalties for noncompliance than the regulation it
replaces. Much remains unknown with respect to how regulators will interpret and implement the
GDPR. Should we be found to not be in compliance with the GDPR, we could be subject to substantial
monetary forfeitures and other penalties.

A failure to adequately protect the privacy of client information or perceived failure to adequately
protect the privacy of client information could have a material adverse effect on our business, net

assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations, and could affect our ability to meet our
obligations, including our ability to make payments on the Notes.

**_Failure to comply with applicable international sanctions or the US Foreign Corrupt Practices_**
**_Act, the UK Bribery Act 2010 or similar applicable worldwide anti-bribery laws or anti-money_**
**_laundering laws could have a material adverse effect on our business._**

Sanctions regimes imposed by governments, including those imposed by UN Security Council, the
EU, the US, and other countries or international bodies prohibit us from engaging in trade and financial
transactions with certain countries, businesses, organizations and individuals. Our operations and the
services we render could bring us within the scope of such sanctions regimes. The legislation, orders,
rules and regulations which establish sanctions regimes are often broad in scope and difficult to
interpret, and in recent years, governments have increased and strengthened such regimes. Any
violation by us of any applicable sanctions could result in fines and other penalties and may have a
negative impact on our reputation and our ability to conduct business in certain jurisdictions or access
international capital markets. Such impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business, net
assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations, and could affect our ability to meet our
obligations, including our ability to make payments on the Notes.

We are also subject to a number of international laws and regulations regarding anti-bribery, anticorruption and anti-money laundering, including the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK
Bribery Act 2010. These laws and regulations, among other things, prohibit all forms of money
laundering and bribery, including improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or
retaining business and may include reporting obligations to certain regulatory and governmental
bodies. The scope and enforcement of anti-corruption laws and regulations varies. Certain regulations
may also have extraterritorial impact, such as, for example, the UK Criminal Finances Act of 2017,
which allows British law enforcement agencies to impose penalties for certain activities outside the UK.
Due to the international nature of our business and particularly because we provide services to clients
that are active in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption, we are exposed to
potential infringements of international laws and regulations regarding anti-bribery, anti-corruption and
anti-money laundering. Our compliance programs and internal control policies and procedures may not
always prevent bribery, money laundering or corruption committed, permitted or authorized by our
employees or clients. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could lead to civil or
criminal fines or penalties, harm our reputation or disrupt our business and could have a material
adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations,
and could affect our ability to meet our obligations, including our ability to make payments on the
Notes.

**_We may not be able to expand into a particular jurisdiction or expand our service offering as_**
**_required by current or potential clients._**

Regulatory or tax changes can lead to demand for client services in jurisdictions where we do not
have any presence or operations, or for new client services that we do not currently offer. If such
demand were to occur, there may be regulatory, compliance related, competition and practical
constraints that could prevent us from establishing an office or other form of presence in such a
jurisdiction or from providing such new client services to meet client demand. Even if we were to be
able to establish an office or other form of presence in such a jurisdiction or provide such new client
services, we may not be able to do so as quickly as would be necessary to meet client demands. Such
inability or delay could result in a loss of current and potential business and may have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, if we are
unable to provide services to our clients in a jurisdiction where clients require us to deliver such
services to them, we may also lose business from those clients in the jurisdictions where we do have a
presence or operations as a result of clients requiring their service providers to be able to provide an
integrated service across the various jurisdictions in which such clients are active. Such loss of
business could have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition, cash
flows and results of operations, and could affect our ability to meet our obligations, including our ability
to make payments on the Notes.

**_Exchange control restrictions, regulatory restrictions or other restrictions regarding the_**
**_repatriation of funds from certain countries in which we operate could limit our ability to make_**
**_foreign investments, procure foreign denominated financings and extract dividends from our_**
**_operating subsidiaries._**

Exchange control restrictions, regulatory restrictions and restrictions regarding the repatriation of
funds may restrict business transactions between residents of certain countries in which we operate
and non-residents of such countries. For example, our subsidiaries in a particular country may
generally not be permitted to export capital, hold foreign currency in excess of certain limits or incur
indebtedness denominated in foreign currencies without the approval of the local authorities, be
prohibited from using transfer pricing and excessive interest rates on foreign loans as a means of
expatriating currency, or generally not be permitted to acquire an interest in a foreign venture without
the approval of the local authorities or be subject to compliance with the investment criteria of such
local authorities. It is difficult to predict what action, if any, governments may take in the future with
respect to exchange controls and similar restrictions. If governments of countries where we do
business were to tighten controls, these restrictions could hinder our ability to make foreign currency
denominated investments, pay dividends from our subsidiaries and procure foreign currency
denominated financings in the future, or pay interest expense on our debt (including the Notes) using
our cash from our operating subsidiaries in such countries. An increase in such restrictions could
therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows
and results of operations, and could affect our ability to meet our obligations, including our ability to
make payments on the Notes.

**_Exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial_**
**_condition and results of operations._**

Our functional and reporting currency is the euro. We are exposed to exchange rate risks in
several ways, particularly with respect to foreign exchange translation effects, arising mainly from the
relative value of the euro compared to the value of the US dollar, the pound sterling, the Swiss franc
and the Hong Kong dollar. Due to the international nature of our business, substantial portions of our
revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the euro. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2018, 44.0% of our revenue was recognized in a currency other than the euro.
Significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the euro and such other currencies could materially
and adversely affect our reported results from year to year. In some of our businesses, we incur costs
in currencies other than those in which revenue are earned. The relative fluctuations between the
exchange rates in the currencies in which costs are incurred and the currencies in which revenue are
earned can materially and adversely affect the profits of those businesses, and could have a material
adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations,
and could affect our ability to meet our obligations, including our ability to make payments on the
Notes.

**_We are exposed to interest rate risks._**

Part of our existing and future debt and borrowings carry, or may carry, floating interest rates. On
an adjusted basis, after giving effect to the Transactions, as of September 30, 2018, 36% (or €285.5
million) of our €785.5 million aggregate principal amount of indebtedness, carried floating interest
rates, approximately 50% (or €142.8 million) of which would not be covered by the intended interest
rate swaps. Our interest costs are therefore subject to fluctuations in interest rates. The use of
derivatives is a highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks different from
those associated with our ordinary business. Depending on market conditions and movements in
interest rates, our use of hedging transactions could enhance or harm our overall performance
compared to that of our competitors. In addition, we will be subject to the creditworthiness of the
counterparties under our hedging transactions, and we will be exposed to the risk of insolvency or
default on the part of our hedge counterparties. Adverse fluctuations and increases in interest rates, to
the extent that they are not hedged, could have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets,
financial condition, cash flows and results of operations, and could affect our ability to meet our
obligations, including our ability to make payments on the Notes.

**_Our consolidated financial statements include significant intangible assets which could be_**
**_impaired._**

We carry significant intangible assets on our balance sheet. As of September 30, 2018, the
intangible assets (acquisition-related intangible assets and other intangible assets) on our balance
sheet totaled €1,474.2 million, including €956.7 million in goodwill, €24.3 million in brand name and
€480.4 million in customer relationships, resulting primarily from acquisitions. Pursuant to current
accounting rules, we are required to assess goodwill for impairment at least annually or more
frequently if impairment indicators are present. Impairment indicators include significant
underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, a significant decline in
share price or market capitalization and negative industry or economic trends. If such events were to
occur, the carrying amount of our goodwill may no longer be recoverable and we may be required to
record an impairment charge. Other intangible assets, such as brand name and customer
relationships, are amortized on a yearly basis. However, if impairment indicators are present, we are
required to test such intangible assets for impairment. A significant impairment of our intangible assets
could have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows and
results of operations, and could affect our ability to meet our obligations, including our ability to make
payments on the Notes.

**_We conduct business in multiple jurisdictions and are exposed to the tax laws of such_**
**_jurisdictions, including the risks in connection with challenges to our tax position._**

We are subject to a large number of different tax laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in
which we operate. These laws and regulations are complex and are subject to varying interpretations.
The combined effect of the application of tax laws of one or more of these jurisdictions, including the
application or disapplication of tax treaties and their interpretation by the relevant tax authorities, could,
under certain circumstances, produce contradictory results. We often rely on generally available
interpretations of tax laws and regulations to determine the existence, scope and level of our liability to
tax in the jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, we take positions in the course of our business
with respect to various tax matters, including but not limited to the taxation of foreign exchange results,
compliance with the at arm’s length principles in respect of transactions with related parties, tax
deductibility of interest and other costs, the amount of depreciation or write-down of our assets that we
can recognize for tax purposes and the value-added tax treatment of our client services. There is no
assurance that the tax authorities in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate will agree with our
interpretation of these laws and regulations or with the positions taken by us. If our tax positions are
challenged by relevant tax authorities, the imposition of additional taxes could increase our effective
tax rate and cost of operations, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets,
financial condition, cash flows and results of operations, and could affect our ability to meet our
obligations, including our ability to make payments on the Notes.

**_Significant changes in our effective tax rate could have a material adverse effect on us._**

We operate a global business and each jurisdiction has its own corporate income tax rates. These
tax rates vary from 0.0% in the Cayman Islands, the Bahamas and the British Virgin Islands to a tax
rate of 26.01% in Luxembourg. Our effective tax rate for each of the periods under review is
significantly impacted by any acquisitions completed during that period and the change to the
proportion of the geographical segments relative to our total business. Based on the current
proportions of our geographical segments relative to our total business, our effective tax rate for the
nine months ended September 30, 2018 was 18.0%. Our estimate with respect to our effective tax rate
is inherently subject to significant uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. As a result, our
actual effective tax rate going forward may vary from our estimate, and those variations may be
material. The materialization of such risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, net
assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations, and could affect our ability to meet our
obligations, including our ability to make payments on the Notes

**_Changes in tax treaties, laws, rules or interpretations or an adverse outcome of tax audits could_**
**_have a material adverse effect on us._**

The tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the tax treaties
concluded by such jurisdictions, may be subject to change, and there may be changes in interpretation

35


-----

and enforcement of such tax laws or regulations, including with respect to applicable transfer pricing
rules regarding intercompany loans and intragroup services, and the value-added tax treatment of our
client services. As a result, we may face increases in taxes payable if tax rates increase, or if tax laws
or regulations are modified in an adverse manner, or if new tax laws or regulations are introduced by
the competent authorities with or without retrospective effect. In this respect we note that in connection
with two rulings from the European Court of Justice, the Dutch fiscal unity regime is envisaged to be
amended with retroactive effect to January 1, 2018. As a result thereof certain provisions of Dutch law
will as of such date have to be applied without giving effect to the existence of a Dutch fiscal unity.
These provisions are the Dutch anti-base erosion rules, the exclusion of low-taxed passive subsidiaries
from the application of the participation exemption, the excess participation debt rules and the tax loss
carry-forward rules. On the date of this Offering Memorandum, it is not clear yet what the exact impact
of the proposed change to the Dutch fiscal unity regime will be on our tax position.

Such changes or any future audit may require us to pay additional taxes plus accrued interest and
penalties. In addition, tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate periodically examine us
and our subsidiaries. Tax audits typically include a review of interest deductibility, our transfer pricing
arrangements, our fiscal unity, the taxation of foreign exchange results, and the amount of depreciation
or write-downs of our assets that we recognize for tax purposes. Tax audits for periods not yet
reviewed may consequently lead to higher tax assessments. Any additional taxes or other sums that
become due could have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition, cash
flows and results of operations, and could affect our ability to meet our obligations, including our ability
to make payments on the Notes.

**_Tax rules limiting the deductibility of interest expenses could reduce our net income._**

We incur a substantial amount of interest expense under the Notes and the New Facilities and we
have incurred a substantial amount of interest expense under our Existing Facilities. In addition, some
of our subsidiaries obtain intercompany financing and record interest expenses on such financing. The
tax deductibility of interest on the Notes, the New Facilities and intercompany financing may be
restricted under the applicable interest deduction limitations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. In
this respect it is noted that ATAD requires Member States to implement a general interest limitation
rule (known as the “earnings stripping rule”), which should enter into force on January 1, 2019. This
rule provides that interest expenses (after having been balanced with interest income) in excess of a
certain threshold will be non-deductible to the extent they exceed 30% of earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization, subject to certain further adjustments. Although the exact
implementation and interpretation of this rule is not yet clear, based on first projections it appears that
such rule, as implemented by the relevant Member States, could result in the limitation of the
deductibility of the interest expenses on the Notes, the New Facilities and intercompany financing
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition, cash flows
and results of operations, and could affect our ability to meet our obligations, including our ability to
make payments on the Notes.

The rules with respect to interest deduction limitations are often complex and are subject to
varying interpretations. Tax authorities typically scrutinize the positions taken by a taxpayer in relation
to the deductibility of interest payments, especially with respect to shareholder loans, acquisition debt
or debt financing of subsidiaries. The tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate may not
agree with the positions taken by us in respect of the deductibility of interest on the Notes, the New
Facilities and intercompany financing. Our tax positions have been challenged and may continue to be
challenged by the relevant authorities. To the extent our interest expenses on the Notes, the New
Facilities and intercompany financing are not deductible, we may incur higher taxable profits and as a
result we may have to pay higher taxes. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, net
assets, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations, and could affect our ability to meet our
obligations, including our ability to make payments on the Notes.

**_If the transfer pricing arrangements we have among our subsidiaries are determined to be_**
**_inappropriate, our tax liability may increase._**

We have transfer pricing arrangements on the basis of which we determine the pricing as well as
terms and conditions for dealings among our subsidiaries in relation to various aspects of our business,

36


-----

in particular with respect to certain group service functions. Transfer pricing regulations applicable in
the countries in which we operate require that any (international) transaction involving associated
enterprises are conducted at arm’s length terms. If a tax authority in any jurisdiction reviews any of our
tax returns and determines that the prices or other terms we have applied in relation to such
arrangements are not in accordance with the relevant transfer pricing rules, or that other income of our
affiliates should be taxed in that jurisdiction, or that we have not complied with the requirements as to
the preparation and availability of transfer pricing documentation, such tax authority may make
adjustments and, as a result we may incur additional tax liabilities, including accrued interest and
penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, net assets, financial condition,
cash flows and results of operations, and could affect our ability to meet our obligations, including our
ability to make payments on the Notes.

**RISKS RELATED TO THE NOTES AND OUR STRUCTURE**

**_Our significant leverage and substantial debt service obligations could adversely affect our_**
**_business and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations with respect to the Notes and the_**
**_Guarantees._**

We use debt to finance our operations. As adjusted for the Transactions, our net indebtedness,
amounted to €785.5 million as of September 30, 2018. In addition, we will have €146.6 million of
available capacity under the New Revolving Credit Facility. See “Capitalization.” Our substantial debt
could have important consequences for our business and operations and for holders of the Notes,
including, but not limited to:

    - making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and other debt and
liabilities, including the New Term Facilities;

    - increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse
economic and industry conditions;

    - requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the
payment of principal of, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of
such cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, developments or
other general corporate purposes;

    - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the
competitive environment and the industry in which we operate;

    - placing us at a disadvantage to our competitors, to the extent they are not as highly
leveraged;

    - limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing;
and

    - limiting our ability to upstream cash from our non-Guarantor subsidiaries to help meet our
obligations under the Notes.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability
to satisfy our debt obligations, including under the Notes and the Guarantees. The terms of the
Indenture do not prohibit our subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness, including additional
indebtedness incurred by non-Guarantor subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor. All of the debt of such
non-Guarantor subsidiaries would rank structurally senior to the Notes. As adjusted for the
Transactions, the non-Guarantor subsidiaries are not expected to have any indebtedness outstanding.
If we incur new debt in addition to our current debt level, the related risks that we now face, as
described above and elsewhere in these “Risks Related to the Notes and our Structure,” could
intensify.

**_We are subject to restrictive covenants under the New Facilities Agreement and the Indenture,_**
**_which could impair our ability to run our business._**

Restrictive covenants under the New Facilities Agreement and the Indenture may restrict our
ability to operate our business. Our failure to comply with these covenants, including as a result of
events beyond our control, could result in an event of default that could materially adversely affect our
financial condition and results of operations.

37


-----

The New Facilities Agreement contains negative covenants restricting, among other things, our
ability to:

    - sell, lease, transfer or dispose of assets and subsidiary stock;

    - pay dividends and make other restricted payments; and

    - create or incur liens.

Each of these covenants is subject to important exceptions and qualifications.

In addition, the Indenture governing the terms of the Notes contains negative covenants
restricting, among other things, our ability to:

    - merge or consolidate with other companies;

    - enter into guarantees with respect to the New Facilities Agreement, certain syndicated
facilities or certain public indebtedness without concurrently guaranteeing the Notes; and

    - create or incur liens.

Each of these covenants is subject to important exceptions and qualifications. For a more detailed
description of these covenants, see “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants.”

The restrictions contained in the New Facilities Agreement and the Indenture could affect our
ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to react to market conditions or take advantage
of potential business opportunities as they arise. For example, such restrictions could adversely affect
our ability to finance our operations, make strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances, restructure
our organization or finance our capital needs. Additionally, our ability to comply with these covenants
and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control. These include prevailing economic,
financial and industry conditions. If we breach any of these covenants or restrictions, we could be in
default under the New Facilities Agreement or the Indenture.

If there were an event of default under any of our debt instruments that is not cured or waived, the
holders of the defaulted debt could terminate their commitments thereunder and cause all amounts
outstanding with respect to such indebtedness to be due and payable immediately, which in turn could
result in cross defaults under our other debt instruments, including the Notes and the New Facilities
Agreement. Any such actions could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation, and we may not be able to
repay our obligations under the Notes and the New Facilities Agreement in such an event.

**_The Indenture will contain limited restrictive covenants and will not restrict our ability to make_**
**_investments, incur indebtedness, pay dividends, repurchase capital stock or enter into affiliate_**
**_transactions._**

The Indenture will contain limited restrictive covenants and the Indenture will not restrict our ability
to:

    - make capital expenditures;

    - invest in affiliates, associates or non-Guarantor subsidiaries (including by servicing
indebtedness at such affiliates, associates or non-Guarantor subsidiaries), repurchase
ordinary or preferred stock, make distributions or issue dividends;

    - issue preferred securities or incur unsecured indebtedness; or

    - enter into transactions with affiliates.

Our taking such actions under the Indenture could adversely affect our ability to pay amounts due
on the Notes.

**_The Issuer may be unable to repurchase the Notes as required upon a Change of Control._**

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined under “Description of the Notes—Certain
_Definitions”), the Issuer would be required to make an offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a_

38


-----

price of 101%, of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of
repurchase. However, the Issuer may be unable to do so because it may not have enough available
funds, particularly since a Change of Control could in certain circumstances cause part or all of our
other debt to become due and payable. In addition, restrictions in our then-existing contractual
obligations, including the New Facilities Agreement, may not allow it to make such required
repurchases upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a Change of Control. See “Description
_of the Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control.”_

**_The Issuer’s ability to pay principal and interest may be affected by our organizational_**
**_structure. The Issuer is dependent upon payments from other members of the Group to fund_**
**_payments to you on the Notes. The Parent Guarantor, the Issuer and certain other Guarantors_**
**_are holding companies, each of which is dependent upon cash flow from its respective_**
**_subsidiaries to meet its obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees._**

The Issuer does not have any material assets or material sources of income. As a result, the
Issuer’s ability to make payments on the Notes is dependent directly upon other payments it receives
from other members of the Group.

The Parent Guarantor and the Subsidiary Guarantors will guarantee the Notes. The Parent
Guarantor is a holding company with no business operations or material assets other than the equity
interests in, and any intercompany receivables from, its subsidiaries. The Parent Guarantor is
dependent upon the cash flow from its operating subsidiaries in the form of dividends, loans, interest
and payments on intercompany loans or other distributions to meet its obligations, including its
obligations under its Guarantee as Parent Guarantor. Furthermore, such operating subsidiaries will
also be restricted by the terms of their present and future indebtedness in their ability to make
distributions or advance upstream loans to enable the Issuer and the Guarantors to make payments in
respect of the Notes or the Guarantees, as the case may be. In addition, applicable tax laws may
subject such payments to further taxation, and may limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries will
be permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests or even prevent such
payments. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the dividend and distribution capacity will be
adequate to fund distributions in amounts and at times sufficient for the Issuer to pay its obligations as
they become due under the Notes. For more information about limitations on distributions, see
“Limitations _on_ _Validity_ _and_ _Enforceability_ _of_ _the_ _Guarantees_ _and_ _Certain_ _Insolvency_ _Law_
_Considerations.”_

**_The Notes and the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to all of the debt and liabilities_**
**_of the Parent Guarantor’s subsidiaries that are not Guarantors and effectively subordinated to_**
**_the extent of collateral to all secured creditors._**

The Notes and the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to all of the debt and liabilities of
the Parent Guarantor’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes. The terms of the Indenture do not
prohibit the Parent Guarantor’s non-Guarantor subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness.
Generally, claims of creditors of a subsidiary that does not provide a Guarantee, including trade
creditors and claims of other shareholders, if any, of such subsidiary, will have priority with respect to
the assets and earnings of such subsidiary over the claims of creditors of its parent entity. In the event
of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding up, liquidation, reorganization, administration or other
bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of any of the Parent Guarantor’s subsidiaries that do not provide
a Guarantee, holders of their indebtedness and their trade creditors will generally be entitled to
payment of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for
distribution to its parent entity. As such, the Notes and the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated
to the creditors (including trade creditors) and other shareholders, if any, of the Parent Guarantor’s
subsidiaries that do not provide a Guarantee. The Parent Guarantor’s subsidiaries may not have
sufficient funds to pay (or receive sufficient funds to pay) all their respective creditors, and you may not
receive any payment on the Notes or receive less, rateably, than the holders of debt of the Parent
Guarantor’s subsidiaries and other liabilities. Subject to certain limitations, the Parent Guarantor’s
subsidiaries will be permitted to incur additional debt and liabilities in the future under the terms of the
Indenture. As of September 30, 2018, the Issuer and the Guarantors represented 70% of the Group’s
net assets (excluding investments in subsidiaries, intangibles arising on business combination,

39


-----

intercompany balances and clearing-related assets). For the twelve months ended September 30,
2018, the Guarantors (excluding the Parent Guarantor and the Issuer, both of which are holding
companies and had negative Adjusted EBITDA) represented 92% of the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA
and 47% of the Group’s revenue. As of September 30, 2018, after giving effect to the Transactions, the
non-Guarantor subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor would not have had any external financial
indebtedness outstanding.

Claims by any secured creditors of the Parent Guarantor, the Issuer or the Subsidiary Guarantors
will have priority with respect to the assets securing their indebtedness over the claims of the holders
of the Notes. As such, any claims of the holders of the Notes will be effectively subordinated to any
secured indebtedness and other secured obligations of the Parent Guarantor, the Issuer or the
Subsidiary Guarantors.

**_Your right to receive payments on the Notes will be effectively subordinated to the rights of our_**
**_existing and future secured creditors. Further, the Guarantees will be effectively subordinated_**
**_to all of the Guarantors’ existing and future secured indebtedness._**

The Notes and the Guarantees will be senior obligations. Lenders under any secured
indebtedness will have claims that are prior to your claims as holders of the Notes to the extent of the
value of the assets securing that other indebtedness. The Notes will be effectively subordinated to
such secured indebtedness and any other secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the
assets securing such indebtedness. In the event of any distribution or payment of our assets in any
foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization or other bankruptcy proceeding, holders
of such secured indebtedness will have a prior claim to those of our and the Guarantors’ assets that
constitute their collateral, and will be entitled to be paid in full from such collateral before any payment
is made on the Notes. In any of the foregoing events, we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient
assets to pay amounts due on the Notes. As a result, holders of the Notes may receive less than the
amounts due under the Notes or nothing at all.

As of September 30, 2018, after giving effect to the Transactions, the non-Guarantor subsidiaries
of the Parent Guarantor would not have had any external financial indebtedness outstanding. We will
be permitted to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including secured debt, in the future under
the terms of the Indenture governing the Notes. While the Indenture includes restrictions on the
incurrence of certain liens on our principal property or on shares of stock of any subsidiary of the
Parent Guarantor to secure indebtedness for money borrowed, such restrictions are subject to various
permissive baskets and de minimis thresholds, do not apply to other forms of indebtedness and do not
capture liens on assets that do not fall within the definition of “Principal Property” or which, in the
opinion of a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Parent Guarantor, is not of material
importance to the total business conducted by the Parent Guarantor and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole.

**_We may incur substantially more debt in the future, which may make it difficult for us to service_**
**_our debt, including the Notes, and impair our ability to operate our business._**

We may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Additionally, the Indenture will not contain
any restriction on the incurrence of additional debt. Moreover, the debt we may incur in the future could
be structurally senior to the Notes, could mature prior to the Notes or may be secured by collateral. In
addition, the Indenture will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute debt under
those agreements, including settlement obligations. The incurrence of additional debt would increase
the leverage-related risks described in this Offering Memorandum.

**_Our failure to comply with the covenants under the Indenture or our other outstanding debt_**
**_agreements, including as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of_**
**_default which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of_**
**_operations._**

The Indenture will require the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries, including the Issuer, to
comply with various covenants, and the New Facilities Agreement requires the Parent Guarantor and
its subsidiaries to comply with various covenants, including a leverage financial maintenance covenant,
which requires the Parent Guarantor and certain of its subsidiaries to maintain a specified net leverage

40


-----

ratio and comply with certain other undertakings. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants”
and “Description of Other Indebtedness.” The Parent Guarantor’s and its relevant subsidiaries’ ability to
meet this financial ratio could be affected by deterioration in our operating results, as well as by events
beyond our control, including unfavorable economic conditions, and there can be no assurance that the
Parent Guarantor and its relevant subsidiaries will be able to meet this financial ratio. Moreover, the
New Facilities Agreement includes certain events of default (such as breaches of representations,
warranties and undertakings and if the Parent Guarantor or its subsidiaries fail to make payment when
due on certain other debt) that are different from the events of default set forth in the Indenture. If an
event of default occurs under the New Facilities Agreement, the Indenture or any of our other debt
instruments and is not cured or waived within the applicable grace periods, the holders of the defaulted
debt could terminate their commitments and declare all outstanding debt, together with accrued and
unpaid interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. Borrowings under our debt
instruments, including the Notes, that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions also may
be accelerated or become payable on demand as a result of an event of default under the New
Facilities Agreement or other debt instruments. In these circumstances, our assets and cash flow may
not be sufficient to repay in full the defaulted debt and its other debt, including the Notes then
outstanding. If some or all of these instruments were accelerated, then we could be forced into
bankruptcy or liquidation, and we may not be able to repay our obligations under the Notes in such an
event.

**_To service our indebtedness, we require a significant amount of cash, and our ability to_**
**_generate cash will depend on many factors beyond our control._**

Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, and to fund planned capital
expenditures depends in part on our ability to generate cash in the future. This depends on the
success of our business strategy and on general economic, financial, competitive, legislative,
regulatory and other factors, as well as the other factors discussed under “—Risks Relating to our
_Business and Industry,” many of which are beyond our control._

There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, that we will
realize operating improvements on schedule or that future borrowings will be available to us in an
amount sufficient to enable us to service and repay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity
needs. Furthermore, applicable law and future contractual arrangements may impose restrictions on
certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to make payments to the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor, which could
impact the Issuer’s or Parent Guarantor’s ability to pay their respective obligations as they mature or to
fund their liquidity needs.

If we are unable to satisfy our debt obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing
plans, such as refinancing or restructuring its indebtedness, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital
investments or seeking to raise additional capital. There can be no assurance that any refinancing or
debt restructuring would be possible, or if possible, that it would be on similar terms to those of our
debt instruments existing at that time, that any assets could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of the
sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales would be favorable to us or that additional
financing could be obtained on acceptable terms. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets, as have
been seen in recent years, could adversely affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs or to refinance
our indebtedness, including our ability to draw on our existing credit facilities or enter into new credit
facilities. Banks that are party to our existing credit facilities may not be able to meet their funding
commitments if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive
volumes of borrowing requests from us and other borrowers within a short period of time.

**_Relevant insolvency laws in the Netherlands, and other jurisdictions may provide you with less_**
**_protection than US bankruptcy law or the bankruptcy laws of other jurisdictions with which you_**
**_may be more familiar._**

The Notes will be issued by the Issuer, a company which is incorporated under the laws of the
Netherlands, and will be guaranteed by the Parent Guarantor and the Subsidiary Guarantors, which
are incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, the Cayman Islands, Jersey and Guernsey. The
insolvency laws of certain of these jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws of
the United States or other jurisdictions with which you may be more familiar. In the event that any one

41


-----

or more of the Issuer, the Parent Guarantor, the Subsidiary Guarantors or any other of the Parent
Guarantor’s subsidiaries experience financial difficulty, it may not be possible to predict with certainty in
which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the
outcome of such proceedings. A brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in the
Netherlands, the Cayman Islands, Jersey and Guernsey is set out under “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes or under the Guarantees across multiple_**
**_jurisdictions may prove difficult._**

The Notes will be issued by the Issuer, a company that is incorporated under the laws of the
Netherlands, and will be guaranteed by the Parent Guarantor and the Subsidiary Guarantors, which
are incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, the Cayman Islands, Jersey and Guernsey. In the
event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in the jurisdictions
mentioned above. Such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are likely to be complex and costly for creditors
and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights.
Your rights under the Notes and the Guarantees will be subject to the insolvency and administrative
laws of several jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce
your rights in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings.

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative, examinership and other laws of the
Issuer’s, the Parent Guarantor’s and the Subsidiary Guarantors’ jurisdictions of organization may be
materially different from, or in conflict with, each other and those of the United States, including in the
areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition
interest and duration of the proceeding. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them,
could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s law should apply, adversely affect your
ability to enforce your rights under the Notes and the Guarantees in those jurisdictions or limit any
amounts that you may receive. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and
_Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” with respect to some of the jurisdictions mentioned above._

The laws of certain of the jurisdictions in which the Guarantors are organized limit the ability of
these subsidiaries to guarantee debt of a related company. See “—Corporate benefit, capital
_maintenance laws and other limitations on the Guarantees may adversely affect the validity and_
_enforceability of the Guarantees.”_

**_There are circumstances other than repayment of the Notes under which Guarantees may be_**
**_released, without your consent or the consent of the Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, Guarantees may be released, including:

    - in connection with any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of a
Subsidiary Guarantor (including by way of merger or consolidation) to a person that is not
(either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Parent Guarantor or a subsidiary
of the Parent Guarantor;

    - in connection with any sale or other disposition of capital stock of a Subsidiary Guarantor or
its direct or indirect parent entity to a person that is not (either before or after giving effect to
such transaction) the Parent Guarantor or a subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor, if the
Subsidiary Guarantor ceases to be a subsidiary as a result of the sale or other disposition;

    - upon the release of its guarantee by a Subsidiary Guarantor under the New Facilities
Agreement (including, without limitation, upon repayment of obligations outstanding under the
New Facilities Agreement); provided that no other indebtedness is at that time guaranteed by
the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor that would have otherwise given rise to an obligation to
guarantee the Notes pursuant to the covenant described under “Description of the Notes—
_Certain Covenants—Limitation on Issuance of Guarantees of Indebtedness by Subsidiaries”_
had the relevant subsidiary not already been a Subsidiary Guarantor; provided further that
should such Subsidiary Guarantor thereafter guarantee obligations under the New Facilities
Agreement (or such guarantee under the New Facilities Agreement is reinstated or renewed),
then such Subsidiary Guarantor will guarantee the Notes on the terms and conditions set forth
in the Indenture;

42


-----

    - in connection with a defeasance of discharge of the Notes, as provided under “Description of
_the Notes—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” and “Description of the Notes—_
_Satisfaction and Discharge”;_

    - with the consent of Holders of at least 66 2/3% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes
then outstanding; or

    - upon the release of the guarantee that gave rise to the requirement to guarantee the Notes
pursuant to the covenant described under “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Issuance of Guarantees of Indebtedness by Subsidiaries,” so long as no event_
of default exists at the time of such release or would arise as a result thereof, and so long as
no other indebtedness is at that time guaranteed by the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor that
would have otherwise given rise to an obligation to guarantee the Notes pursuant to such
covenant had the relevant subsidiary not already been a Subsidiary Guarantor.

**_You may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for US securities laws violations._**

The Issuer and a majority of our operating subsidiaries, including the Guarantors, are organized
outside the United States, and their business is conducted primarily outside the US. Although the
Issuer and the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with
any action under US securities laws or under the Indenture, you may be unable to effect service of
process within the US on the directors and executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors. In
addition, because a majority of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors and their respective
subsidiaries and all or a majority of the assets of their directors and executive officers are located
outside of the US, you may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in the US courts against them.
Moreover, actions of the Issuer and the Guarantors may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of
the federal securities laws of the US. See “Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.”

The US is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of
judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with the Netherlands,
the Cayman Islands, Jersey and Guernsey. There is, therefore, doubt as to the enforceability in such
countries of civil liabilities based upon US securities laws in an action to enforce a US judgment in such
countries. In addition, the enforcement in such countries of any judgment obtained in a US court based
on civil liabilities, whether or not predicated solely upon US securities laws, will be subject to certain
conditions. There is also doubt that a court in any of the foregoing countries would have the requisite
power or authority to grant remedies sought in an original action brought in such country on the basis
of US securities laws violations. For further information see “Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.”

**_Corporate benefit, capital maintenance laws and other limitations on the Guarantees may_**
**_adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees._**

The laws of certain of the jurisdictions in which the Guarantors are organized limit the ability of
these entities to guarantee debt of a related company. These limitations arise under various provisions
or principles of corporate law which include rules governing capital maintenance, under which, among
other things, the risks associated with a Guarantee on account of a direct or indirect parent company’s
debt need to be reasonable and economically and operationally justified from the Guarantor’s
perspective, as well as thin capitalization and fraudulent transfer principles. If these limitations are not
observed, the Guarantees by the Guarantors could be subject to legal challenge. In accordance with
the applicable laws of these jurisdictions, the Guarantees will contain language limiting the amount of
debt guaranteed so that applicable local law restrictions will not be violated. Accordingly, if you were to
enforce the Guarantees by a Guarantor in one of these jurisdictions, your claims are likely to be limited.
In some cases, where the amount that can be guaranteed is limited by reference to the net assets and
legal capital of the Guarantor or by reference to the outstanding debt owed by the relevant Guarantor
to the Issuer under intercompany loans, that amount might have reached zero or close to zero at the
time of any insolvency or enforcement. Therefore the Guarantee provided by such a Guarantor will
contain language limiting the Guarantor’s obligations and liabilities not to include any obligations and
liabilities to the extent those would be contrary to the applicable laws or regulatory requirements.
Further, though we believe that the Guarantees will be validly given by the Guarantors, in accordance
with local law restrictions, there can be no assurance that a third-party creditor would not successfully
challenge the Guarantees in legal proceedings.

43


-----

Similarly, the laws of certain jurisdictions in which the Guarantors are organized prohibit, under
certain conditions and unless available exemption procedures were carried out, so-called financial
assistance such as direct or indirect, and whether by means of a loan, guarantee, the provision of
security or otherwise, financial assistance for or in connection with a purchase of or subscription from
that company’s shares or shares of its direct or indirect controlling entity. The consequence of a breach
of the financial assistance prohibition would be the absolute invalidity or ineffectiveness of the
respective transactions. In these jurisdictions, the Guarantees will contain language excluding certain
types of obligations from the scope of such Guarantees which, in turn, may limit the amount
guaranteed or secured thereunder. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees
_and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_The Issuer is part of a fiscal unity for Dutch corporate income tax purposes, which could_**
**_expose it to an additional cost and may therefore affect its ability to repay the Notes._**

The Issuer is part of a fiscal unity (fiscale _eenheid)_ for Dutch corporate income tax
(vennootschapsbelasting) purposes which has Intertrust N.V. as head of the fiscal unity (the “Intertrust
**Fiscal Unity”). Consequently, the Issuer, and each of the members of the Intertrust Fiscal Unity, are**
jointly and severally liable for any Dutch corporate income tax due by the Intertrust Fiscal Unity. The
fact that the Issuer is part of a fiscal unity could expose it to an additional cost, which may therefore
affect the Issuer’s ability to repay the Notes.

**_Insolvency laws and other limitations on the Guarantees, including fraudulent conveyance_**
**_statutes, may adversely affect their validity and enforceability._**

The Issuer’s obligations under the Notes will be guaranteed by the Parent Guarantor and the
Subsidiary Guarantors. The Parent Guarantor is organized under the laws of the Netherlands. The
Subsidiary Guarantors are organized under the laws of the Netherlands, the Cayman Islands, Jersey
and Guernsey. Although laws differ among these jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer
and conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and, in the case of the Guarantees,
limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the
enforceability of a Guarantee against a Guarantor. A court may also in certain circumstances void a
Guarantee where a Guarantor is close to or in the vicinity of insolvency.

In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed
insolvency administrator may challenge the Guarantees, and intercompany obligations generally, as
fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it
makes certain findings, to:

    - void or invalidate or declare ineffective all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its
Guarantee;

    - direct that holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee to the relevant
Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors; and

    - take other action that is detrimental to you.

If the Issuer cannot satisfy its obligations under the Notes and any Guarantee is found to be a
fraudulent transfer or conveyance or an improper transfer of assets or is otherwise set aside, there can
be no assurance that the Issuer can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In
addition, the liability of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited to the amount that will result
in such Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution.
However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in making a
determination of the maximum liability. Also, there is a possibility that the entire Guarantee may be set
aside, in which case, the entire liability may be extinguished.

In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent or improper transfer or other applicable
principles, courts may need to make findings that, at the time the Guarantees were issued, a
Guarantor:

    - issued such Guarantee with the intent or knowledge of hindering, delaying or defrauding
current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or created
such security after its insolvency;

44


-----

    - was aware of the fact that some creditors were disadvantaged over other creditors by these
actions;

    - issued such Guarantee in a situation where a prudent businessman as a shareholder of such
Guarantor would have contributed no equity to such Guarantor; or

    - received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the
Guarantee on the basis that the Guarantee was incurred for the Issuer’s benefit, and only
indirectly for the Guarantor’s benefit, or some other basis and (i) was insolvent or rendered
insolvent by reason of the issue of the Guarantee, or subsequently became insolvent for other
reasons; (ii) was engaged, or about to engage, in a business transaction for which the
Guarantor’s assets were unreasonably small; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would
incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as and when they would become
due.

However, less-stringent requirements may be provided under the laws of certain jurisdictions.

Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor generally may, in
different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Guarantee if:

    - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets;

    - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; or

    - the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total
existing debts and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or
become absolute.

Although we believe that the Issuer and the Guarantors are solvent, and will be so after giving
effect to the Transactions, there can be no assurance which standard a court would apply in
determining whether a Guarantor was insolvent as of the date the Guarantees were issued or that,
regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on
that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent
on the date its Guarantee was issued, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent
transfers on other grounds.

For an overview of the enforceability issues as they relate to the Guarantees, see “Limitations on
_Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes._**

Because the Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the US Securities Act or the
securities laws of any other jurisdiction, they may not initially be sold in the United States except to
persons reasonably believed to be QIBs within the meaning of and pursuant to Rule 144A, and may
not be offered or sold except to non-US persons outside the United States in offshore transactions in
reliance on Regulation S or pursuant to another exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the
registration requirements of the US Securities Act and all other applicable laws. These restrictions may
limit the ability of investors to resell the Notes. It is the obligation of investors in the Notes to ensure
that all offers and sales of the Notes within the United States and other countries comply with
applicable securities laws. See “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and “Notice to
_Investors.”_

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the_**
**_Notes will be limited._**

The Notes are new issues of securities for which there is currently no established trading market.
There can be no assurance as to:

    - the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

    - your ability to sell your Notes; or

    - the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

45


-----

Future trading prices of the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things,
prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. The liquidity of a
trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar
securities. Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions
that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. Any such
disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of Notes, regardless of our prospects and
financial performance. The Initial Purchasers have advised that they intend to make a market in the
Notes after completing the Offering. However, they have no obligation to do so and may discontinue
market-making activities at any time without notice. In addition, such market-making activity will be
subject to limitations imposed by the US Securities Act and other applicable laws and regulations. As a
result, there may not be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops,
you may not be able to resell your Notes at a fair value, if at all.

**_The Notes may not be listed or remain listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange._**

If the Issuer cannot maintain the listing on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and
the admission to trading on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange’s Euro MTF Market or it determines that
it will not maintain such listing, the Issuer may cease to make or maintain such listing on the Official
List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, provided that it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain and maintain the listing of the Notes on another recognized stock exchange, although there can
be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to do so. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity
of the Notes as a result of listing on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or another
recognized listing exchange for comparable issuers in accordance with the Indenture, failure to be
approved for listing or the delisting of the Notes from the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange or another listing exchange in accordance with the Indenture may have a material adverse
effect on a holder’s ability to resell Notes in the secondary market.

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore investors must rely on the_**
**_procedures of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through Euroclear and
Clearstream. Interests in the Global Notes will trade in book-entry form only, and Notes in definitive
registered form (“Definitive Registered Notes”), will be issued in exchange for book-entry interests
only in very limited circumstances. Owners of book-entry interests will not be considered holders of
Notes. The common depositary, or its nominee, for Euroclear and Clearstream, will be the sole
registered holder of the Global Notes representing the Notes.

Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the Global Notes will
be made to the Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter,
these payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the Global
Notes representing the Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment
to the common depositary, or its nominee, for Euroclear and Clearstream, the Issuer, the Trustee and
the Paying Agent will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other
amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if investors own a book-entry interest, they
must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and if investors are not participants in
Euroclear and Clearstream, they must rely on the procedures of the participant through which they own
their interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of Notes under the Indenture.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct
right to act upon the Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from
holders of the Notes. Instead, if an investor owns a book-entry interest, it will be permitted to act only to
the extent it has received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream. The
procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable such investor
to vote on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until
Definitive Registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if investors own book-entry
interests, they will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures to be

46


-----

implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream may not be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of
rights under the Notes. See “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.”

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities_**
**_and are subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The
ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk
factors discussed in this Offering Memorandum and other factors that may affect the value of the
Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and is subject to revision,
suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit
rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or
withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant.
A revision, suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by
one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our
financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euros. An investment in the Notes denominated in
a currency other than the currency by reference to which you measure the return on your investments
will entail foreign exchange-related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in
the value of the euro relative to other relevant currencies because of economic, political or other
factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the euro against other relevant currencies could
cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in
a loss to you when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which you
measure the return on your investments. Investments in the Notes by US holders (as defined under
“Tax _Considerations—Certain_ _US_ _Federal_ _Income_ _Tax_ _Considerations”)_ may also have tax
consequences as a result of foreign exchange gains or losses, if any. See “Tax Considerations—
_Certain US Federal Income Tax Considerations.”_

**_If certain changes to tax law were to occur, the Issuer would have the option to redeem the_**
**_Notes._**

If certain changes in the law of any relevant tax jurisdiction, as described under “Description of the
_Notes—Withholding Taxes,” become effective that would impose withholding taxes or other deductions_
on the payments on the Notes and as a result the Issuer is required to pay additional amounts, the
Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time, at a redemption price of 100% of
the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and additional amounts, if any, to the
date of redemption. In addition, the Issuer will, subject to certain exceptions, be required to pay such
additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such
payments by the holder of the Notes after such withholding or other deduction equal the amounts
which would have been received in respect of such payments in the absence of such withholding or
deduction. Such additional amounts may be substantial and result in a sudden material increase in the
Issuer’s contractual commitments and the Issuer may not have enough available funds to comply with
its obligation to pay such additional amounts. The Issuer is unable to determine whether such changes
to any tax laws will be enacted and if such changes in the law do occur in any relevant tax jurisdiction,
the Notes will be redeemable at the Issuer’s option.

**_The introduction of a Dutch conditional withholding tax on interest payments may increase the_**
**_amounts that we are obliged to pay under the Notes._**

On October 10, 2017, the Dutch government released its policy statement (Regeerakkoord 2017_2021 “Vertrouwen in de toekomst”), which does not include concrete legislative proposals, but sets out_
a large number of policy intentions of the Dutch government. In the policy statement it was announced
that the Netherlands will introduce a new conditional withholding tax on interest payments paid to
low-tax jurisdictions. In a letter to the Dutch parliament dated February 23, 2018, the Dutch UnderMinister of Finance published more details about the proposed introduction of withholding tax on

interest payments. The letter states that the interest withholding tax would apply to interest paid by a
Dutch entity within a group to entities that are resident (i) in a jurisdiction with a low statutory rate or
(ii) in a jurisdiction included in the EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions. In addition, the letter states
that measures will be taken to counteract abusive situations (misbruiksituaties). According to the letter,
abusive situations include a situation where a payment of interest is not made directly to a low-tax or
non-cooperative jurisdiction, but where such interest indirectly reaches such jurisdiction by means of
an artificial construction. In his letter, the Dutch Under-Minister of Finance announced that it is intended
for the withholding tax on interest payments to be effective from 2021 and that a legislative proposal
will be submitted to the Dutch parliament in 2019. This was reiterated by the Dutch Under-Minister of
Finance in one of the legislative proposals published on budget day 2018 (Prinsjesdag 2018). The
exact scope of the proposed legislation is not yet certain. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that the
envisaged interest withholding tax could have a wider application and, as such, it could potentially be
applicable to payments made by the Issuer under the Notes. If such payments become subject to
Dutch withholding tax under the envisaged legislation, the Issuer may be required to pay Additional
Amounts (see “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes”), which may give rise to an event
whereby the Issuer may be entitled to redeem the Notes (see “Description of the Notes—Redemption
_for Taxation Reasons”)._

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The Issuer intends to use the proceeds from the Offering, together with cash on hand and
borrowings under the New Term Facilities to: (i) repay in full borrowings under the Existing Facilities
Agreement; and (ii) pay costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions,
including certain financing fees with respect to the New Facilities, including the New Revolving Credit
Facility, Initial Purchasers’ fees, legal and accounting expenses and other transaction costs.

The following table sets forth the estimated sources and uses of the funds necessary to
consummate the Transactions. Such amounts are subject to adjustments and may differ from the
actual amounts depending on several factors, including the actual Issue Date, and differences from the

euro-denominated bank loan of the Existing Facilities (excluding break costs and accrued and unpaid interest thereon
(assuming repayment on November 15, 2018) of approximately €1.0 million); (ii) $100,000,000 of outstanding borrowings

rollover the €3.4 million of bank guarantees outstanding under ancillary facilities established under the Existing Facilities
Agreement which are off-balance sheet liabilities. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates are lenders under the
Existing Facilities Agreement and as a result will receive a portion of the net proceeds of the Notes. See “Plan of
_Distribution.”_

(1) Represents cash attributable to the Group at the end of the period, which together with cash held on behalf of clients at the
end of the period (€19.8 million) constitutes cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period of €98.0 million.
(2) Represents expected cash on balance sheet on the Issue Date as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions. See “Use of
_Proceeds.”_
(3) Represents non-current loans and borrowings amounting to €776.0 million and amortized costs amounting to €3.9 million
which comprise the euro equivalent of the outstanding indebtedness under the Existing Facilities, converted at an exchange
rate of $1.1576 to €1.00 with respect to the US dollar-denominated bank loan and £0.8873 to €1.00 with respect to the
pound sterling-denominated bank loan (which were the exchange rates as of September 30, 2018 used by the Group for
internal purposes), including break costs and accrued and unpaid interest thereon. The proceeds of the Offering are used to
repay borrowings under the Existing Facilities using the same exchange rate. In connection with the repayment of floating
rate obligations under the Existing Facilities using the proceeds from the Offering, we expect to terminate certain interest
rate hedging arrangements, the termination of which we expect on a net basis to result in no costs to the Group.
(4) Does not include the bank guarantees outstanding under ancillary facilities established under the Existing Facilities
Agreement amounting to €3.4 million.
(5) Represents: (i) the euro equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of $200,000,000 US dollar-denominated bank loan
established under the New Facilities Agreement, at an exchange rate of $1.1576 to €1.00, which was the exchange rate as

amount of £100,000,000 pound sterling-denominated bank loan established under the New Facilities Agreement, at an
exchange rate of £0.8873 to €1.00, which was the exchange rate as of September 30, 2018 used by the Group for internal
purposes. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—New Facilities Agreement.”
(6) The New Revolving Credit Facility will provide for revolving commitments of up to €150,000,000. The New Revolving Credit
Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, to fund acquisitions and to fund working capital of the Group. The
Issuer will be the original borrower under the New Revolving Credit Facility. Subject to agreed guarantee principles and
limitations, the New Revolving Credit Facility will be guaranteed by the Guarantors. At the Issue Date, we do not expect the
New Revolving Credit Facility to be drawn, however, we will roll over €3.4 million of bank guarantees outstanding under
ancillary facilities from the Existing Revolving Credit Facility to the New Revolving Credit Facility as off-balance sheet
liabilities. We therefore expect to have approximately €146.6 million available for borrowing under the New Revolving Credit
Facility on the Issue Date. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—New Facilities Agreement.”

(1) For the year ended December 31, 2015, Adjusted Revenue was €344.9 million and Adjusted Other Operating Expenses
were €41.9 million as a result of the addback to revenue of the €0.3 million revenue generated from a client in our
Luxembourg segment with which we settled a claim in 2015 (the “2015 Settlement”) and as a result of the €0.3 million
expenses in relation to the 2015 Settlement. Under IFRS we were required to offset the amount of a settlement with a client
with the revenue generated from such client. As a result, both our revenue and other operating expenses line item for the
year ended December 31, 2015 were reduced by the amount of the 2015 Settlement, which only affected the revenue and
other operating expenses of our Luxembourg segment and therefore of the Group for the year ended December 31, 2015
and had no effect on the revenue and other operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 and for
the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2018 (and neither for the twelve months ended September 30, 2018).

which we administered approximately 48,300 entities. As of September 30, 2018, our clients were

**FACTORS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY**

The analysis of the business is organized on and managed from a geographical perspective. We
changed our business segments in 2017 and 2018 and as a result, the comparability of the results per
geographic segment over the different periods for certain of our business segments is limited.

Since January 2018, our reporting structure is comprised of the following segments: the
Netherlands; Luxembourg; the Americas; Jersey; and the Rest of the World. The Cayman Islands are
now included in the new Americas segment together with the Bahamas, Brazil, the British Virgin
Islands, Curacao and the United States, which were previously part of the Rest of the World segment.

From January 2017 to December 2017, our operating segments were the Netherlands,
Luxembourg, the Cayman Islands, Jersey and the Rest of the World segment.

Before January 2017, our operating segments were the Netherlands, Luxembourg, the Cayman
Islands, Guernsey and the Rest of the World segment.

The reconciliation table below shows our restated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017

**KEY FACTORS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**

The following factors have contributed significantly to the development of our business and results
of operations and are expected to continue to have a significant effect on our business and results of
operations.

**_Organic Growth_**

Our results of operations are impacted by the organic growth of our business. The key drivers of
the organic growth of our business are the net inflow of new client entities, the increase of the average
revenue per client entity that we service, operational efficiencies, the expansion of our business
geographically by opening offices in new locations and the broadening of our existing service offering.

The net inflow of client entities is determined as the difference between the inflow of new client
entities and the outflow of existing client entities. Historically, the ARPE of new client entities has
generally been higher than the ARPE of existing client entities flowing out. This is mainly due to the
additional services that we are generally asked to provide to new client entities driven by, among other
things, additional regulatory, compliance and business reporting requirements. In addition to the net
inflow of new client entities, our organic growth is driven by our ability to generate additional revenue
from our existing clients by providing additional services to existing entities, by providing services to
new entities of existing clients and through cross-selling across our global network, through our
business partners who refer new business opportunities to us and through our direct selling activities.

Cross-selling comprises the referral of new business from one office of our global network to
another. Cross-selling has been and continues to be an important source of new business. In addition
to our cross-selling efforts, we rely on our business partners, which include financial institutions, law
firms, auditors and financial advisory firms, to refer new business to us. Furthermore, our direct sales
efforts and the proactive solicitation of new clients generate new business opportunities. In that regard,
we recently created a global client solutions team to further accelerate our services and product
development as we aim to adapt to the changing needs of our clients. In addition, we added
specialized sales capabilities to our teams in the UK and the US in order to improve our business
development efforts in these regions. The level of new business that we acquire through our crossselling efforts, through referrals from our business partners and through our direct sales approach
impacts our revenue and operating profits.

In addition, our organic growth is impacted by our ability to improve the utilization of our billable
FTEs, our ability to offer additional higher value-added services to our clients and our ability to increase
our prices. Achieving operational efficiencies, for example, through implementing improvements to our
IT system, enables our employees to spend less time on non-billable activities which generally
increases our billing ratio. We also seek to provide additional value-added services to our clients and
the client entities that we service. These services can include, for example, substance related services,
additional legal administration services (such as organizing more frequent board meetings), additional

56


-----

accounting and reporting services (such as quarterly reporting and IFRS reporting services) and
compliance services. Finally, we seek to selectively increase our prices in line with inflation.
A successful implementation of these initiatives generally results in an improvement of our revenue
and operating profits.

Finally, our organic growth is driven by our ability to expand our business geographically by
opening offices in new locations to attract new clients and new business from existing clients and our
ability to diversify our revenue by expanding our service offering with additional and complementary
services to our existing service lines. We typically open new offices when we receive a significant
number of requests from existing clients or prospective clients to provide services in new locations or
when we see increasing demand for our services coming from a specific region. Depending on the
location, our new offices focus on operational or sales activities. For example, we began operating in
Australia in July 2018 after having acquired Seed Outsourcing and we have recently opened a new
sales office in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates. New operational offices, however, typically
operate at a loss for a period of time as we acquire the necessary infrastructure, such as office space
and personnel, before revenue generated by our services are sufficient to cover our operating costs.
We also strive to diversify our revenue by expanding our service offering with additional and
complementary services, such as FATCA consulting, compliance services, including compliance
consulting and compliance outsourcing services, and AIFM ManCo services. Expansion through
opening new offices and by adding complementary services to our service offering has positively
impacted and is expected to continue to impact our operating profits.

**_Growth through Acquisitions_**

We have completed four acquisitions since January 1, 2015: CorpNordic, a provider of expert
administrative services in the Nordic countries, completed in June 2015; Elian, a specialist in capital
market solutions, private equity, real estate and fund administration and corporate services as well as
private client solutions, completed in September 2016; Azcona, a professional services provider,
completed in February 2017; and Seed Outsourcing, a boutique Australian expert administrative
services firm, providing corporate secretarial, director, domiciliation and payroll services to private
equity and real estate fund managers, completed in July 2018. We have successfully delivered on the
projected synergies following the acquisitions and integrations of ATC (2013), CorpNordic (2015) and
Elian (2016). In general, following any acquisition, our results of operations are impacted by the results
of the newly acquired business, debt incurred to acquire the business, if any, and expenditures made
in connection with the acquisition and to integrate the newly acquired business into the Group. When
seeking to integrate and improve a newly acquired business, we generally look to several key areas:
(i) reviewing current service lines and prices and seeking to improve operational processes and cost
structures to achieve satisfactory operating margins; (ii) implementing organizational changes to bring
the acquired business in line with our Group-wide standards; (iii) exploring ways to increase
collaboration between our existing and our newly acquired businesses and benefit from economies of
scale including with respect to the use of non-billable support staff; (iv) sharing knowledge and
experience and implementing Group-wide best practices; and (v) leveraging our ability to raise
financing. Many of these integration measures require expenditure by us. As a result, we incurred
transaction costs of €0.1 million, €0.1 million, €4.2 million and €5.3 million, as well as integration and
transformation costs of €9.2 million, €7.8 million, €8.5 million and €3.1 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2018 and for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
which primarily include costs with respect to renegotiations or termination of contractual arrangements,
employee redundancies and other administrative expenses related to the reorganization of existing or
newly acquired businesses.

In connection with the acquisitions, we have also recognized significant intangible assets relating
to goodwill, customer relationships and brand name. Intangible assets relating to goodwill as of
September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 amounted to €956.7 million,
€948.5 million, €981.3 million and €627.1 million, respectively, which represented 64.0%, 62.8%,
61.0% and 57.7% of our total non-current assets, respectively. Intangible assets relating to customer
relationships as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 amounted to
€480.4 million, €500.4 million, €555.9 million and €392.0 million, respectively, which represented
32.1%, 33.1%, 34.8% and 36.1% of our total non-current assets, respectively. Intangible assets
relating to brand name as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 amounted

57


-----

to €24.3 million, €25.3 million, €28.1 million and €30.1 million, respectively, which represented 1.6%,
1.7%, 1.7% and 2.8% of our total non-current assets, respectively. Total non-current assets were
€1,494.0 million, €1,510.4 million, €1,607.7 million and €1,087.2 million as of September 30, 2018
and December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The non-current assets consist primarily of
goodwill, customer relationships and brand name associated with the consummated acquisitions.
Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. We are required to subject goodwill
to impairment testing. Accordingly, on at least an annual basis, we must assess whether there have
been any impairments in the carrying value of our goodwill. If the carrying value of the asset is
determined to be impaired, then such asset is written down to fair value and an impairment loss is
recorded in our income statement. Customer relationships and brand name are measured at cost less
accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Customer relationships and brand
name as well as other intangible assets are amortized on a yearly basis. However, if impairment
indicators are present, we are required to test such intangible assets for impairment. For the nine
months ended September 30, 2018 and the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, there
were no impairments to our intangible assets. For further information, see “Risk Factors—Our
_consolidated financial statements include significant intangible assets which could be impaired.”_

As a result of these acquisitions, and the intra-year timing of these acquisitions, the historical
consolidated financial information does not comprise the results of operations of our entire business
undertaking as it exists at the date of this Offering Memorandum for the nine months ended
September 30, 2018 and 2017 and the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Accordingly,
the comparability of the historical consolidated financial information and over each of these periods is
limited. For further information on the preparation of the financial information included in this Offering
Memorandum, see “Presentation of Financial and Other Information.”

**_Wages and Salaries_**

Our largest expense consists of personnel costs, the majority of which consists of wages and
salaries. As of September 30, 2018, we employed 2,532 FTEs worldwide, of which 1,890 FTEs (74.6%
of our total FTEs) were categorized as billable and the remainder were categorized as non-billable.
Consequently, we have been able to achieve economies of scale by being able to adjust increasing
demand for our services with an increase in billable FTEs without a proportionate increase in
non-billable FTEs, which has led to improvements in our operating margins. As we aim to remain
efficient, we completed a headcount alignment program in 2018, which involved around 60 employees
across different locations. The program was implemented to ensure we keep our staff costs under
control and allocate the right resources to the right positions. We expect to launch similar programs in
the future to further maintain our efficiency. The total costs associated with this program amounted to
approximately €6.0 million and were categorized as one-off integration and transformation costs.

**_Foreign Currency Fluctuations and Translation_**

Our reporting currency is the euro. Our exposure to the risk of changes in exchange rates relates
primarily to our operating activities where the revenue or expenses related to those activities is
denominated in a different currency than our reporting currency. Our exposures to foreign currency
fluctuations are mainly with respect to the US dollar, the pound sterling and the Hong Kong dollar. For
the nine months ended September 30, 2018, 44.0% of our revenue was recognized in a currency other
than the euro.

Foreign currency transactions are converted to the respective functional currencies of the relevant
operating subsidiary using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign
currency gains and losses resulting from such transactions are recognized in our income statement.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, foreign currency differences arising from foreign
currency transactions resulted in a loss of €0.1 million. Foreign currency differences resulted in a gain
of €1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a loss of €9.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016 and a loss of €1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. In the course of
2017 we settled the majority of the intercompany positions which were causing the foreign currency
fluctuations, by offsetting intercompany payables and receivables that were the result of the Elian
acquisition and the subsequent intercompany restructuring, which resulted in lower exposure from
these positions.

58


-----

At a Group level, all assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to euro at exchange
rates at the relevant reporting date. Income and expenses of foreign operations are translated to euro
at the relevant reporting date using exchange rates as of the dates of the relevant transactions.
Foreign currency gains and losses resulting from the translation to our reporting currency are
recognized in equity.

Our loans and borrowings are denominated in euro, pound sterling and US dollar. The objective in
selecting the relevant denominations for such loans and borrowings is to match the main cash flow
generated by our underlying operations with our debt, which provides an economic hedge.

**_Taxation_**

We operate a global business and each jurisdiction has its own statutory corporate income tax
rates. These tax rates vary from 0.0% in the Cayman Islands, the Bahamas and the British Virgin
Islands to a tax rate of 26.01% in Luxembourg. Based on the current proportions of our geographical
segments relative to our total business, our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30,
2018 was 18.0%. Our estimate with respect to our effective tax rate is inherently subject to significant
uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. As a result, our actual effective tax rate going
forward may vary from our estimate, and those variations may be material.

**_Regulatory Environment_**

Increasing compliance requirements and regulatory complexity contributes to the growth of our
business. The implementation of new regulations aiming to increase transparency and reporting
requirements and to discourage aggressive tax planning measures tends to result in more complexity,
a greater administrative burden and higher compliance costs for our clients and potential clients. The
trend towards increasing complexity in the regulatory environment has historically tended to more than
offset initiatives aimed at regulatory and legal simplification or international harmonization. Increased
compliance requirements for clients also drives the demand for substance services, which in turn
further drives hours per client entity. An example of recent regulation increasing transparency
requirements is the EU’s Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive. Following the implementation
deadline of June 26, 2017, we generated a small amount of incremental billable hours for assisting
clients with the ultimate beneficial owners register filings.

Our clients adjust their presence and activities to different tax laws and regulations across
jurisdictions. The political pressure to curb tax avoidance has led to, and we believe will lead to further
legislation changes, which contribute to differences in tax attractiveness between jurisdictions. As a
result, we see a trend of increased activities in onshore jurisdictions compared to offshore jurisdictions.
See also “Risk Factors—A significant change in the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which
_our clients operate or where client entities are domiciled, particularly any unfavorable amendments to_
_corporate and tax laws and regulations and double tax treaties, may have an adverse effect on our_
_business.” and “Risk Factors—Certain prospective amendments to double tax treaties may have an_
_adverse effect on our business.”_

Another example of a recent trend is the relocation of activities by international clients driven by
regulatory changes, which benefit global organizations like us who have local presence in multiple
jurisdictions and can facilitate cross-border transfers.

We maintain an ongoing dialogue with regulators to ensure we stay at the forefront of our industry.
We believe that our industry should be regulated in all key markets and promote a more stringent
regulatory oversight. We actively discuss with regulators how to further improve the quality of our
sector.

**_Outsourcing Trends_**

On the back of increased regulatory complexity, outsourcing has increased as clients no longer
have the time, expertise or risk appetite to perform the required services in-house. This is particularly

59


-----

the case for activities where in-house provision of services would result in sub-scale operations or
where limited internal institutional knowledge exists, as is often the case for support functions in new
geographic markets. Our business benefits from clients and prospective clients looking to achieve cost
savings and improved service by outsourcing their corporate service requirements to us because of our
specialized capabilities and larger scale.

**DESCRIPTION OF KEY LINE ITEMS**

Set out below is a brief description of the composition of key line items in our financial statements.

**_Revenue_**

Our primary source of revenue is from the provision of services to clients. Our services are
provided on a time and cost basis or on a fixed price basis or a combination of both. Our revenue from
services comprises income and commissions from our expert administrative client services. Our
revenue is driven by growth from acquisitions, organic growth and other factors such as foreign
currency fluctuations.

**_Staff Expenses_**

Staff expenses consist of wages and salaries, social security contributions, pension costs,
share-based payments related to the IPO in 2015, share-based payments upon integration after the
Elian and Azcona acquisitions, share-based payments in relation to the long-term incentive plan and
other personnel costs (such as temporary staff costs and training costs).

**_Rental Expenses_**

Rental expenses consist of expenses related to the rental of office space for our personnel, utilities
and maintenance costs.

**_Other Operating Expenses_**

Other operating expenses include marketing and sales expenses, IT expenses, travel, insurance
costs, professional fees and other costs associated with our business operations. It also includes
(i) transaction costs and (ii) integration and transformation costs, which are specific expenses incurred
not in the ordinary course of business and which are separately disclosed by virtue of their size or
incidence to enable a full understanding of our financial performance. Transaction costs include costs
related to transactions such as acquisition due diligence costs, external legal and other advisory fees
incurred in connection with acquisitions and advisory fees incurred in preparation for the Offering.
Integration and transformation costs include costs incurred in connection with the integration of
acquisitions, such as moving costs, IT expenses, severance payments and temporary employee costs
as well as the transformation and restructuring of the business.

**_Other Operating Income_**

Other operating income includes those items related to transactions giving rise to income primarily
from gains on disposals.

**_Depreciation and Amortization_**

Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible
assets. Intangible assets include customer relationships, our brands and other intangible assets such
as computer software. Tangible assets include leasehold improvements, furniture and fittings, office
and computer equipment and motor vehicles.

**_Financial Result_**

Financial result comprises interest expense on borrowings, which we calculate using the effective
interest method, commitment fees, capitalized finance costs, interest income on funds invested, gains
and losses on disposals of financial assets, gains and losses on hedging instruments and foreign
exchange gains and losses.

60


-----

**_Income Tax_**

Income tax consists of current and deferred income tax. Income tax is recognized in our income
statement except to the extent it relates to items recognized directly in equity in which case it is
recognized as equity. As we generate revenue and recognize income throughout our network of
foreign subsidiaries, we may recognize a different statutory tax rate than the Netherlands, which is the
jurisdiction of incorporation of the Parent Guarantor. As a result, our effective tax rate at the
consolidated level can vary significantly from our statutory tax rate in the Netherlands in any given
taxable period. See “—Key Factors Affecting Our Business and Results of Operations—Taxation.”

Current income tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates
substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous
years.

Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.

**SELECTED KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS**

**_Adjusted EBITDA_**

Our Adjusted EBITDA increased by €1.7 million, or 1.2%, to €144.1 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2018, from €142.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. This
increase was primarily due to strong growth in our Luxembourg and Rest of the World segments, partly
offset by increased HQ and IT expenses and lower revenue in our Netherlands and Jersey segments.

**_Adjusted EBITA_**

Our Adjusted EBITA increased by €1.6 million, or 1.2%, to €135.8 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2018, from €134.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. This
increase was primarily due to strong growth in our Luxembourg and Rest of the World segments, partly
offset by increased HQ and IT expenses and lower revenue in our Netherlands and Jersey segments.

for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, from €65.1 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2017 as a result of the depreciation in value of the US dollar in the nine months ended
September 30, 2018. However, Underlying Revenue increased slightly by 0.5%, as we benefited from
increased client activity levels and increased demand for regulatory services.

_Jersey: Our revenue in Jersey slightly decreased by €0.9 million, or 2.1%, to €43.2 million for the_
nine months ended September 30, 2018, from €44.1 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2017. Underlying Revenue decreased by 0.9% in the same period. These changes were primarily the
result of Brexit-related uncertainties and a continued effect of the decision of a large Private Wealth
client to insource services we had previously provided.

_Rest of the World: Our revenue in the Rest of the World increased by €3.3 million, or 3.6%, to_
€94.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, from €90.9 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2017, and Underlying Revenue increased by 6.1%, driven by Funds
performance in Hong Kong, continued growth of the Corporates and Funds businesses in Spain, and
positive performance across all services lines in the Nordics.

_Staff Expenses_

Our staff expenses increased by €4.1 million, or 2.6%, to €164.6 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2018, from €160.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. This
increase was primarily driven by an increase in headcount following the growth of our client services.

_Rental Expenses_

Our rental expenses slightly increased by €0.3 million, or 1.5%, to €18.1 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2018, from €17.9 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2017.

_Other Operating Expenses_

Our other operating expenses increased by €1.1 million, or 2.4%, to €46.9 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2018, from €45.8 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2017. Excluding transaction costs, integration and transformation costs, share-based payments related
to the IPO in 2015, share-based payments upon integration after the Elian and Azcona acquisitions
and other income/expense, other operating expenses decreased by €0.7 million, to €36.5 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2018, from €37.3 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2017. This decrease was mainly driven by a one-off legal claim and related fees
recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2017.

_Depreciation and Amortization_

Our depreciation and amortization charges for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 were
€39.1 million, compared to €39.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. Our charges
for depreciation and amortization of other intangibles slightly increased by €0.1 million, or 1.4%, to
€8.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, from €8.2 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2017.

_Profit/(Loss) from Operating Activities_

As a result of the foregoing factors, our profit from operating activities for the nine months ended
September 30, 2018 was €94.6 million, in line with the profit from operating activities of €94.8 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.

_Financial Result_

Our financial result decreased by €3.2 million, or 17.5%, to a financial loss of €21.4 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2018, from a financial loss of €18.2 million for the nine months

-----

ended September 30, 2017. This decrease was primarily the result of unfavorable foreign exchange
losses in the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the foreign exchange gains in the
nine months ended September 30, 2017. Our finance expenses for the nine months ended
September 30, 2018 of €21.4 million included €17.9 million bank interest, €2.7 million amortization of
financing fees, net foreign exchange losses of €0.1 million, €0.2 million loss in net change in fair value
of derivatives, as well as other costs of €0.5 million. Our finance expenses for the nine months ended
September 30, 2017 of €18.2 million include €17.1 million bank interest, €3.4 million amortization of
financing fees, net foreign exchange gains of €2.6 million, €0.3 million gain in net change in fair value
of derivatives, as well as other costs of €0.6 million.

_Income Tax_

Our income tax expense decreased by €4.5 million, or 25.3%, to an income tax charge of
€13.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, from €17.7 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2017. This decrease was primarily the result of the higher income tax expense in
the nine months ended September 30, 2017 due to a one-off tax expense of €5.4 million which we
provisionally booked in relation to the period before the IPO (2012 to 2015) following discussions with
the Dutch tax authorities. In the fourth quarter of 2017 we reached an agreement with the Dutch tax
authorities reducing the €5.4 million tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 to
€0.3 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, our effective tax rate was 18.0%,
based on a profit before income tax for nine months of €73.3 million. Our effective tax rate was
impacted by the effect of the tax rates in foreign jurisdiction as described above, by, among other
things: (i) non-tax-deductible expenses; (ii) the generation of tax exempt income; (iii) the change in
recognized deductible temporary differences; (iv) the recognition of previously unrecognized tax
losses; (v) the current year losses for which no deferred tax has been recognized; and (vi) the underand overprovision in previous years.

_Profit/(Loss) for the Nine Months_

As a result of the foregoing factors, our profit for the period increased by €1.4 million, or 2.4%, to
€60.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, from a profit of €58.7 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2017.

_Revenue_

Our revenue increased by €99.5 million, or 25.8%, to €485.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017, from €385.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. On an Underlying
Basis, our revenue increased by 4.4%. This increase was primarily driven by the growth of our
business in Luxembourg (with an Underlying Revenue increase of 12.1%) and Jersey (with an
Underlying Revenue increase of 9.1%). In the course of 2017, the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering
Directive had to be implemented in Member States as the deadline for implementation into national law
was June 26, 2017. The Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive introduced an explicit requirement for
legal entities to hold adequate, accurate and current information on their ultimate beneficial owners
which increased demand for our compliance services in Member States.

_Revenue per Segment_

The table below sets forth our revenue per business segment for the years ended December 31,
2017 and 2016.

_The Netherlands: Our revenue in the Netherlands for the year ended December 31, 2017 was_
€117.2, which was in line with our revenue in the Netherlands for the year ended December 31, 2016
(€117.1 million). The market in the Netherlands remained flat due to a mixed effect of higher demand
for increasingly complex compliance and regulatory requirements and uncertainty about tax changes.

_Luxembourg: Our revenue in Luxembourg increased by €14.6 million, or 17.7%, to €97.1 million_
for the year ended December 31, 2017, from €82.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Underlying Revenue increased by 12.1%, mainly driven by strong growth in our Funds service line,
supported by an increase of billable staff. The growth in our Funds service line reaffirmed the position
of Luxembourg as a leading jurisdiction in funds services.

_The Cayman Islands: Our revenue in the Cayman Islands increased by €11.3 million, or 19.7%, to_
€68.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from €57.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016. Underlying Revenue increased by 1.6%. This change was primarily driven by
growth in our regulatory and compliance services line.

_Jersey: Our revenue in Jersey increased by €44.5 million, to €58.5 million for the year ended_
December 31, 2017, from €14.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Revenue increased by
9.1% on an Underlying Basis. The revenue increase in Jersey was driven by strong demand across
most service lines, especially Funds.

_Rest of the World: Our revenue in the Rest of the World increased by €29.0 million, or 25.3%, to_
€143.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from €114.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016. Underlying Revenue growth for 2017 was 3.4%. This change was primarily the
result of the increased revenue generated by our Corporates services line in the Nordic countries, as
well as the result of the higher revenue generated by our Funds and Capital Markets service lines in
Ireland and Spain. Our revenue also increased due to the additional revenue generated after our
acquisition of the remaining 25% stake in SFM Spain together with Azcona in February 2017.

_Staff Expenses_

Our staff expenses increased by €43.8 million, or 25.7%, to €214.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017, from €170.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was

65


-----

primarily driven by the increase in the average number of FTE employees resulting from the full year
inclusion of the FTE employees of Elian in 2017 as opposed to the inclusion of the FTE employees of
Elian for less than four months in 2016 due to the intra-year timing of the acquisition.

_Rental Expenses_

Our rental expenses increased by €4.0 million, or 20.1%, to €24.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017, from €20.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was
mainly driven by the full year inclusion of the rental expenses of Elian in 2017 as opposed to the
inclusion of the rental expenses of Elian for less than four months in 2016 due to the intra-year timing
of the acquisition.

_Other Operating Expenses_

Our other operating expenses increased by €11.5 million, or 22.8%, to €62.0 million for the year
ended December 31, 2017, from €50.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding
transaction costs, integration and transformation costs, share-based payments related to the IPO in
2015, share-based payments upon integration after the Elian and Azcona acquisitions and other
income/expenses, other operating expenses increased by €17.7 million, to €50.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 2017, from €32.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase
was mainly driven by the full year inclusion of the operating expenses related to Elian in 2017 as
opposed to the inclusion of the operating expenses of Elian for less than four months in 2016 due to
the intra-year timing of the acquisition.

_Depreciation and Amortization_

Our depreciation and amortization charges increased by €9.5 million, or 22.4%, to €52.0 million
for the year ended December 31, 2017, from €42.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.
This increase was primarily the result of the Elian acquisition and the amortization of the related
intangibles acquired as part of the acquisition. Our charges for depreciation and amortization of other
intangibles increased by €2.3 million, or 26.1%, to €11.0 million for the year ended December 31,
2017, from €8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was mainly driven by
investments in IT related intangibles in 2017, which are capitalized and then amortized.

_Profit/(Loss) from Operating Activities_

As a result of the foregoing factors, our profit from operating activities increased by €30.7 million,
or 30.0%, to €132.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from €102.1 million for the year
ended December 31, 2016.

_Financial Result_

Our financial result decreased by €4.7 million, or 15.4%, to €25.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017, from €30.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was
primarily the result of the financial gains (€1.9 million) recognized in 2017 compared to the financial
losses (€9.6 million) accounted for in 2016. Our finance expenses for the year ended December 31,
2017 of €28.1 million included €22.9 million of interest expenses, €4.5 million amortization of
financing fees as well as other costs of €0.7 million. Our finance expenses for the year ended
December 31, 2016 of €30.8 million included €16.5 million of interest expenses, €4.0 million
amortization of financing fees, net foreign exchange losses of €9.6 million, as well as other costs of
€0.7 million.

_Income Tax_

Our income tax expense decreased by €0.6 million, or 3.2%, to an income tax charge of
€18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from €19.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily the result of the mix of profits and tax rates in the
various jurisdictions, where a larger portion of our profits were generated in jurisdictions with lower tax

66


-----

rates. During the year ended December 31, 2017, our effective tax rate was 17.6%, based on a profit
before income tax for the year of €107.6 million. Our effective tax rate was impacted by the effect of
the tax rates in foreign jurisdiction as described above, by, among other things, non-tax-deductible
expenses, the generation of tax exempt income, the change in recognized deductible temporary
differences, the recognition of previously unrecognized tax losses, the current year losses for which no
deferred tax has been recognized and by the under- and overprovision in previous years.

_Profit/(Loss) for the Year_

As a result of the foregoing factors, our profit for the period increased by €36.7 million, or 70.7%,
to €88.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from a profit of €52.0 million for the year
ended December 31, 2016.

**_Comparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015_**

operating results for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.

(1) For the year ended December 31, 2015, Adjusted Revenue was €344.9 million and Adjusted Other Operating Expenses
were €41.9 million as a result of the addback to revenue of the €0.3 million revenue generated from a client in our
Luxembourg segment with which we settled a claim in 2015 (the “2015 Settlement”) and as a result of the €0.3 million
expenses in relation to the 2015 Settlement. Under IFRS we were required to offset the amount of a settlement with a client
with the revenue generated from such client. As a result, both our revenue and other operating expenses line item for the
year ended December 31, 2015 were reduced by the amount of the 2015 Settlement, which only affected the revenue and
other operating expenses of our Luxembourg segment and therefore of the Group for the year ended December 31, 2015
and had no effect on the revenue and other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016.

_Revenue_

Our revenue increased by €41.2 million, or 11.9%, to €385.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016, from €344.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. On an Underlying
Basis, our revenue increased by 3.0%. The growth in our revenue was driven by the acquisition of
Elian (which contributed 8.3% or €28.5 million to our revenue in 2016), and the year-on-year growth in
Luxembourg (€5.6 million, a 7.4% increase on an Underlying Basis), the Netherlands (€4.8 million, a
4.3% increase on an Underlying Basis) and the Rest of the World (€8.4 million). The growth in revenue
generated in the Rest of the World was mainly due to the full year contribution to our revenue by
CorpNordic in 2016, whereas CorpNordic only contributed to the revenue of the Rest of the World for
six months during 2015. The increase in our revenue was partly offset by the decline in the revenue
generated by our business in the Cayman Islands (€6.1 million less compared to 2015, a 10.6%
decline on an Underlying Basis) as a result of the re-entry of a competitor in the Cayman Islands
market. The increase in our revenue was further partly offset by the decrease of the revenue generated
in Guernsey as a result of the weakening of the pound sterling.

_Adjusted Revenue per Segment_

For comparison of the revenue per segment for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015,
we use Adjusted Revenue instead of revenue as we believe that such information is the most relevant
in evaluating the results of the respective segments for these periods. Our Adjusted Revenue for the
year ended December 31, 2015 was €344.9 million as a result of the addback to revenue of the
€0.3 million revenue set off as a result of the 2015 Settlement. The table below sets forth our Adjusted
Revenue per business segment for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.

**TOTAL . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **385.8** **344.9** **11.9%** **3.0%**

_The Netherlands: Excluding the revenue generated by the Elian entities, our Adjusted Revenue in_
the Netherlands increased by €4.8 million, or 4.3%, to €116.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2016, from €112.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 (an increase of 4.3% on an
Underlying Basis). This change was primarily the result of the growth of our Corporates service line,
due to an increase in market share as a result of a competitive inflow of client entities, despite a
slowdown of the demand for expert administrative services in the market.

_Luxembourg: Excluding the revenue generated by the Elian entities, our Adjusted Revenue in_
Luxembourg increased by €5.6 million, or 7.4%, to €80.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2016, from €75.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 (an increase of 7.4% on an
Underlying Basis). This change was primarily the result of the addition of billable employees combined
with a higher billing ratio per employee.

_The Cayman Islands: Excluding the revenue generated by the Elian entities, our Adjusted_
Revenue in the Cayman Islands decreased by €6.1 million, or 10.4%, to €52.7 million for the year
ended December 31, 2016, from €58.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 (a decrease of
10.6% on an Underlying Basis). This change was primarily the result of a decline in registered office
entities administered by us mainly due to the re-entry of a competitor in the Cayman Islands market.
The decline was also the result of the sale of our representative banking activities in the Cayman
Islands at the end of 2015.

_Guernsey: Excluding the revenue generated by the Elian entities, our Adjusted Revenue in_
Guernsey for the year ended December 31, 2016 was €27.7 million which was in line with the Adjusted
Revenue generated for the year ended December 31, 2015 which amounted to €27.9 million. On an
Underlying Basis, our Adjusted Revenue generated in Guernsey increased by 11.9% as a result of an
increase in regulatory and compliance services.

_Rest of the World: Excluding the revenue generated by the Elian entities, our Adjusted Revenue in_
the Rest of the World increased by €8.4 million, or 11.8%, to €79.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016, from €70.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 (an increase of 3.9%
on an Underlying Basis). This change was primarily the result of the strong growth of our business in
Spain, Ireland, UK and Singapore.

_Staff Expenses_

Our staff expenses increased by €25.8 million, or 17.8%, to €170.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016, from €144.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was
primarily driven by the increase in the average number of FTE employees resulting from the acquisition

68


-----

of Elian and the full year inclusion of the FTE employees of CorpNordic in 2016 as opposed to the
inclusion of the FTE employees of CorpNordic for only six months in 2015 due to the intra-year timing
of the acquisition. Furthermore, the staff expenses in 2015 were also lower because of a €6.7 million
reduction in our pension liabilities derived from a change in our Dutch pension plan. Staff expenses for
2016 included €4.1 million of equity share-based payments in relation to the IPO.

_Rental Expenses_

Our rental expenses increased by €2.9 million, or 16.6%, to €20.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016, from €17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase can be
almost fully attributed to the rental expenses of Elian, acquired in the course of 2016, and the full year
inclusion of the rental expenses of CorpNordic in 2016 as opposed to the inclusion of the rental
expenses of CorpNordic for only six months in 2015 due to the intra-year timing of the acquisition.

_Other Operating Expenses_

Our other operating expenses increased by €8.8 million, or 21.2%, to €50.5 million for the year
ended December 31, 2016, from €41.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding
transaction costs, integration and transformation costs, share-based payments related to the IPO in
2015, share-based payments upon integration after the Elian acquisition and other income/expenses,
other operating expenses increased by €0.4 million, to €32.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2016, from €32.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was mainly driven by
the integration of Elian and the increase in IT expenses following our investments in our IT systems
during 2016.

_Other Operating Income_

Our other operating income decreased by €3.6 million, or 97.1%, to €0.1 million for the year
ended December 31, 2016, from €3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The operating
income reported for the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted mainly of the indemnity of
€2.4 million received from former shareholders for the Dutch tax claim for tax years 2011 to 2013 and
of €1.3 million for a gain on the sale of Intertrust Bank (Cayman) Limited.

_Depreciation and Amortization_

Our depreciation and amortization charges increased by €5.3 million, or 14.1%, to €42.5 million
for the year ended December 31, 2016, from €37.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.
This increase was primarily the result of the amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection
with the Elian acquisition. Our charges for depreciation and amortization of other intangibles increased
by €1.6 million, or 21.8%, to €8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from €7.2 million for
the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was mainly driven by the higher depreciation and
amortization of our software as a result of the higher capital expenditures relating to the
implementation of the business application roadmap and other investments in our IT systems.

_Profit/(Loss) from Operating Activities_

As a result of the foregoing factors, our profit from operating activities decreased by €5.2 million,
or 4.8%, to €102.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from €107.3 million for the year
ended December 31, 2015.

_Financial Result_

Our financial result decreased by €70.0 million, or 69.6%, to €30.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016, from €100.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was
primarily the result of the refinancing of our then existing senior facilities and second lien facilities using
the proceeds of the IPO and the Existing Facilities and restructuring of our shareholder loans. Our
finance expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 of €30.8 million included €20.5 million bank
interest, €0.7 million other related costs and foreign exchange losses of €9.6 million. Our finance

69


-----

expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 of €100.7 million included €47.0 million bank
interest, €7.0 million shareholder loan interest, €33.7 million write-off of financing fees in relation to our
senior facilities and second lien facilities in place before the IPO, €5.5 million amortization of financing
fees, net foreign exchange losses of €1.6 million, as well as expenses relating to the termination of our
senior facilities and second lien facilities in place before the IPO and other costs of €5.9 million.

_Income Tax_

Our income tax expense increased by €15.5 million to an income tax charge of €19.5 million for
the year ended December 31, 2016, from €4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This
increase was primarily the result of the increase of profit before income tax by €64.9 million. During the
year ended December 31, 2016, our effective tax rate was 27.3%, based on a profit before income tax
for the year of €71.5 million. Our effective tax rate was impacted by non-tax-deductible interest
expenses in the fiscal unity of Intertrust Luxembourg and by non-tax-deductible specific items
(transaction costs and share-based payment expenses related to the Elian acquisition).

_Profit/(Loss) for the Year_

As a result of the foregoing factors, our profit for the period increased by €49.3 million to
€52.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from a profit of €2.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2015.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Our principal source of liquidity is cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from
indebtedness incurred by the Group. Our principal liquidity requirements are for working capital, capital
expenditures, general corporate use and for servicing our debt.

Our working capital is composed of work-in-progress (which represents the gross unbilled amount
expected to be collected from clients for time-based work performed to date), trade receivables, other
receivables, prepayments and cash held on behalf of clients less deferred income, trade payables and
other payables. Our working capital amounted to €5.9 million as of September 30, 2018, which
represented 1.2% of our revenue for the twelve months ended September 30, 2018.

**_Cash Flows_**

The table below summarizes our consolidated cash flows for the periods indicated.

_Cash Flow from/(used in) Operating Activities_

Net cash from operating activities increased by €6.9 million to an inflow of €115.5 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2018 from an inflow of €108.6 million for the nine months ended

70


-----

September 30, 2017, mainly due to higher cash flow from working capital for the nine months ended
September 30, 2018 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2017, partly offset by higher
tax payments in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the nine months ended
September 30, 2017.

Net cash from operating activities increased by €4.5 million to an inflow of €156.9 million for the
year ended December 31, 2017 from an inflow of €152.4 million for the year ended December 31,
2016, mainly due to better operational results.

Net cash from operating activities increased by €24.9 million to an inflow of €152.4 million for the
year ended December 31, 2016 from an inflow of €127.5 million for the year ended December 31,
2015, mainly due to better operational results and a higher inflow from working capital.

_Cash Flow from/(used in) Investing Activities_

Net cash used in investing activities decreased by €2.8 million to an outflow of €9.3 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2018 from an outflow of €12.1 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2017 primarily due to the lower amount of cash used for acquisitions in the nine months
ended September 30, 2018 (related to the earn-out in connection with the Azcona acquisition and the
consideration for the acquisition of Seed Outsourcing) compared to the amount of cash used for
acquisitions in the nine months ended September 30, 2017 (related to the cash consideration for the
acquisition of the remaining stake in SFM Spain and Azcona).

Net cash used in investing activities decreased by €169.3 million to an outflow of €12.8 million for
the year ended December 31, 2017 from an outflow of €182.1 million for the year ended December 31,
2016 primarily due to the Elian acquisition in 2016, causing an outflow of an amount of €171.5 million
in investing activities compared to an outflow of €7.7 million in 2017.

Similarly, net cash used in investing activities increased by €147.9 million to an outflow of
€182.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from an outflow of €34.2 million for the year
ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to the above explained impact of the acquisition of Elian,
compared to the €22.3 million invested in acquisitions during 2015.

_Cash Flow from/(used in) Financing Activities_

Net cash used in financing activities decreased by €6.1 million to an outflow of €85.2 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2018 from an outflow of €91.3 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2017 due to the repayment of ancillary facilities under the Existing Revolving
Credit Facility in 2017 (€18.0 million) partially offset by the higher dividend payment and a higher
amount spent on the acquisition of treasury shares in the nine months ended September 30, 2018.

Net cash from/(used in) financing activities decreased by €159.1 million to an outflow of
€136.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from an inflow of €22.5 million for the year
ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the impact of the share issuance of €120.8 million in 2016,
a treasury share buyback of €47.0 million in 2017 and a higher dividend payment in 2017
(€48.3 million in 2017 compared to €22.1 million in 2016), partly offset by the refinancing of our
borrowings with borrowings of a lower amount in 2016.

Net cash from/(used in) financing activities increased by €73.5 million to an inflow of €22.5 million
for the year ended December 31, 2016 from an outflow of €51.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2015. The difference in cash from/(used in) financing activities is mainly due to the
higher repayment amounts of the loans and bank borrowings and interest and other financing
expenses in 2015 compared to 2016.

**_Capital Resources_**

_Short-term indebtedness_

As of September 30, 2018, we had no short-term indebtedness and as of September 30, 2018,
after giving effect to the Transactions as described under “Use of Proceeds,” we would have had no
short-term indebtedness either.

71


-----

_Long-term indebtedness_

We have significant long-term debt service obligations. As of September 30, 2018, our long-term
indebtedness consisted of borrowings under the Existing Facilities and the Existing Revolving Credit
Facilities amounting to €779.8 million. As of September 30, 2018, after giving effect to the
Transactions as described under “Use of Proceeds,” our long-term indebtedness would have consisted
of €500.0 million aggregate principal amount of Notes offered hereby and €285.5 million of borrowings
under the New Term Facilities. We do not expect the New Revolving Credit Facility to be drawn,
however, we will roll over €3.4 million of bank guarantees outstanding under ancillary facilities from the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility to the New Revolving Credit Facility as off-balance sheet liabilities.
We therefore expect to have approximately €146.6 million available for borrowing under the New
Revolving Credit Facility on the Issue Date. See “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalization.”

The Indenture governing the terms of the Notes contains negative covenants restricting, among
other things, our ability to:

    - merge or consolidate with other companies;

    - enter into guarantees with respect to the New Facilities Agreement, certain other syndicated
credit facilities or certain public indebtedness without concurrently guaranteeing the Notes;
and

    - create or incur liens.

The New Facilities Agreement governing the New Term Facilities and the New Revolving Credit
Facility contains covenants restricting, among other things, our ability to:

    - sell, lease, transfer or dispose of assets and subsidiary stock;

    - pay dividends and make other restricted payments; and

    - create or incur liens.

Each of these covenants is subject to important exceptions and qualifications. For a more detailed
description of these risks, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and our Structure—We are
_subject to restrictive covenants under the New Facilities Agreement and the Indenture, which could_
_impair our ability to run our business.”_

**Contractual Obligations and Commitments**

The following table is a summary of our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2018, after
giving effect to the Transactions as described under “Use of Proceeds,” and not taking into account
effects of exchange rates and interest expense.

established under the New Facilities Agreement, at an exchange rate of $1.1576 to €1.00, which was the exchange rate as
of September 30, 2018 used by the Group for internal purposes; and (ii) the euro equivalent of the aggregate principal
amount of £100,000,000 pound sterling-denominated bank loan established under the New Facilities Agreement, at an
exchange rate of £0.8873 to €1.00, which was the exchange rate as of September 30, 2018 used by the Group for internal
purposes. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—New Facilities Agreement.”
(2) The New Revolving Credit Facility will provide for revolving commitments of up to €150,000,000. The New Revolving Credit
Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, to fund acquisitions and to fund working capital of the Group. The
Issuer will be the original borrower under the New Revolving Credit Facility. Subject to agreed guarantee principles and
limitations, the New Revolving Credit Facility will be guaranteed by the Guarantors. At the Issue Date, we do not expect the
New Revolving Credit Facility to be drawn, however, we will roll over €3.4 million of bank guarantees outstanding under
ancillary facilities from the Existing Revolving Credit Facility to the New Revolving Credit Facility as off-balance sheet
liabilities. We therefore expect to have approximately €146.6 million available for borrowing under the New Revolving Credit
Facility on the Issue Date. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—New Facilities Agreement.”

-----

**Capital Expenditure**

We define capital expenditure not related to acquisitions as investments in property, plant,
equipment and software. We generally have low levels of capital expenditure unrelated to acquisitions
as our business is capital light, which in turn results in limited related depreciation.

Capital expenditure for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 amounted to €4.6 million (of
which €2.9 million related to additions of intangible assets, and €1.7 million related to additions of
property, plant and equipment). For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, capital
expenditure amounted to €19.2 million (of which €11.7 million related to business combinations with
incoming entities, €5.0 million related to additions of intangible assets, and €2.5 million related to
additions of property, plant and equipment), €556.4 million (of which €538.5 million related to business
combinations with incoming entities in intangible assets, €6.6 million related to business combinations
with incoming entities in property, plant and equipment, €7.1 million related to additions of property,
plant and equipment and €4.3 million related to software additions) and €36.9 million (of which
€25.8 million related to business combinations with incoming entities in intangible assets, €0.2 million
related to business combinations with incoming entities in property, plant and equipment, €7.5 million
related to additions of intangible assets, and €3.4 million related to additions of property, plant and
equipment), respectively. We expect to spend approximately 2% of our revenue on capital expenditure
in 2018 and 2019.

**Contingent and Other Off-Balance Sheet Liabilities**

We are not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to
have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditure or capital resources, except for certain commercial leases on motor vehicles and office
equipment and lease agreements for real estate. As of September 30, 2018, on a consolidated basis,
we were a party to off-balance sheets arrangements in relation to commercial leases on motor vehicles
and office equipment and lease agreements for real estate amounting to €69.6 million, IT
commitments related to communication networks and outsourced activities amounting to €16.1 million
and bank guarantees outstanding under ancillary facilities established under the Existing Facilities
Agreement amounting to €3.4 million.

**Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosure about Credit Risk, Liquidity Risk and Market Risk**

**_Overview_**

We have exposure to the following main risks from our financial instruments: credit risk; liquidity
risk; and market risk (including currency risk and interest rate risk). We have implemented policies and
procedures designed to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures, which are regularly
reviewed by our Management Board.

**_Framework_**

Our Management Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of our risk
management framework. Our risk management framework is based on the COSO Enterprise Risk
Management Framework. The framework identifies four risk categories: strategic; operational;
reporting/finance; and compliance. Periodic reporting with respect to the four risk categories takes
place on the following items:

    - reporting on pre-defined key risk indicators;

    - reporting on incidents; and

    - reporting on periodic risk self-assessments, which are performed annually.

Local offices prepare and discuss monthly risk reports in local risk committees. These reports are
also submitted to our Head of Internal Audit who is responsible for preparing a monthly consolidated
report for the Executive Committee and our Management Board.

73


-----

We have adopted a “three lines of defense” model to manage our risk:

    - the first level of risk management is performed by the business. Our business teams bear
primary responsibility for identifying, controlling and monitoring the risks within their
processes, maintaining effective internal control frameworks and adhering to global
compliance policies and standards;

    - the second level of risk management is risk oversight. The Compliance and Risk Management
team is globally responsible for coordinating, developing and monitoring our risk management
processes and adherence to compliance standards and procedures. The Compliance and
Risk Management team is responsible for providing the independent risk reports to the
Executive Committee, our Supervisory Board and our Audit and Risk Committee. The
Compliance and Risk Management team also monitors changes that may impact the risk
profile of the business and whether it is appropriate to provide new services to existing clients.
The Compliance and Risk Management team further ensures that employees in every office
receive compliance training, in addition to the mandatory Group-wide e-learning courses on
AML and other relevant topics; and

    - the third level of risk management concerns assurance of the effectiveness of internal controls
and general governance of our Group provided by our Internal Audit team. The independent
Internal Audit team conducts audits that provide insights into how and to what extent we
control the risks that may jeopardize our strategic and other objectives. These audits provide
management with additional assurance on the effectiveness of internal controls and risk
management.

In addition, our Group finance function manages our funding, liquidity and exposure to currency
and interest rate risk.

Our Supervisory Board, in particular the Audit and Risk Committee of our Supervisory Board,
supervises our risk management framework.

**_Credit Risk_**

Credit risk is the risk that a counterpart will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or
customer contract, leading to a financial loss. We are exposed to credit risk primarily for trade
receivables and cash at banks. Customer credit risk is managed by each of our entities subject to our
policy, procedures and control relating to customer credit risk management. Outstanding customer
receivables are monitored and followed up continuously. We make provisions when there is objective
evidence that we will not be able to collect the debts (for example, if there is an indication that the
debtor is experiencing significant financial difficulty or default, probability of bankruptcy, problems to
contact the clients or disputes with a customer). Analysis is done on a case by case basis in line with
policies. We write off bad debts when identified.

The cash and cash equivalents and interest receivable that we hold are held mainly with banks
which are rated “A” or higher by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services or Fitch Ratings Ltd.

**_Liquidity Risk_**

Liquidity risk includes the risk to a shortage of funds and the risk that we will encounter difficulty in
meeting our obligations associated with our financial liabilities.

We monitor our risk to a shortage of funds using a recurring liquidity planning tool: we make global
cash flow forecasts each three months covering the next six month period and we make global cash
flow forecasts each December for the next twelve-month period.

Our subsidiaries prepare their own cash flow forecasts and they are centrally consolidated by our
Group finance function. Our Group finance function monitors rolling forecasts of our liquidity
requirements, as well as our actual cash and receivables position to ensure that we have sufficient
cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on our committed borrowings
facilities to ensure that we do not breach borrowing limits or covenants.

74


-----

We keep the amounts required for working capital management and our Group finance function
determines the best use of any excess cash, including for the repayment of loans, deposits or
otherwise.

**_Market Risk_**

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest
rates will affect our income or the value of our holdings of financial instruments. The objective of
market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable
parameters, while optimizing the return.

_Currency risk: Our exposure to the risk of changes in exchange rates relates primarily to our_
operating activities (when revenue or expenses is denominated in a different currency from our
functional currency). Our exposure is mainly with respect to the US dollar (USD) and the pound sterling
(GBP).

Our loans and borrowings are denominated in the euro, the pound sterling and the US dollar. The
objective is to match the main cash flows generated by our underlying operations with the debt which
provides an economic hedge.

_Interest rate risk: Interest rate risk relates to our long-term debt obligations with floating interest_
rates. To manage the interest rate fluctuations exposure on our loans and borrowings, we enter into
interest rate swaps. As of September 30, 2018, the notional amounts of the interest rate swaps that we
had entered into were €253 million, £41 million and $30 million, covering the floating rate of interest
payments on 42% of the nominal value of our loans and borrowings outstanding at that time. After
completion of the Offering, the notional amounts of the interest rate swaps that we intend to enter into
are £50 million and $100 million, covering the floating rate of interest payments on 50% of the nominal
value of our floating rate loans and borrowings outstanding on the Issue Date.

**Critical Accounting Policies**

Except as otherwise indicated, our financial information included in this Offering Memorandum has
been prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS. See “Presentation of Financial and Other
_Information” and the notes to the Financial Statements contained in this Offering Memorandum. In_
particular, see Note 3 of our Annual Consolidated Financial Statements “Significant accounting policies
_and standards.”_

The preparation of financial statements requires our management to make a number of estimates
and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, of revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. All
assumptions, expectations and forecasts used as a basis for certain estimates within our financial
statements represent good faith assessments of our future performance for which our management
believes there is a reasonable basis.

These estimates and assumptions represent our view at the times they are made, and only then.
They involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual future results,
performance and achievements to differ materially from those forecasted. The estimates and
assumptions that may have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities within the next financial year are described below. We have discussed the development
and selection of these significant accounting policies and estimates with our independent auditors.

**_Revenue_**

We recognize revenue to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to us
and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at fair value of the consideration
received or receivable, excluding discounts, rebates and sales taxes or duty. Revenue comprises the
revenue generated by our Corporates, Funds, Capital Markets and Private Wealth service lines as well
as rental income generated by subleasing to Group clients. Revenue is recognized in profit or loss in

75


-----

proportion to the stage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date. The stage of completion
is assessed by reference to the related service performed to date as percentage of total services to be
performed. When we act in the capacity of an agent rather than as a principal in a transaction, the
revenue recognized is the net amount of commission made by us.

**_Intangible Assets_**

_Goodwill and Business Combinations_

We account for business combinations using the acquisition method as of the acquisition date,
which is the date in which control is transferred to us. The consideration transferred in the acquisition is
generally measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired. Any goodwill that arises is
tested annually for impairment. Any gain on a bargain purchase is recognized in profit or loss
immediately. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if related to the issue of debt or
equity securities.

The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing
relationships. Such amounts are generally recognized in profit and loss.

Any contingent consideration payable is measured at fair value at the acquisition date. If the
contingent consideration is classified as equity, then it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted
for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are
recognized as profit or loss.

After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. In
respect of an equity-accounted investee, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying
amount of this investment, and any impairment loss is allocated to the carrying amount of the equityaccounted investee as a whole.

_Other Intangible Assets_

Intangible assets that are acquired separately by us and have finite useful lives are measured at
cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. We do not have intangible
assets with indefinite useful lives.

**_Foreign Currency_**

_Foreign Currency Transactions_

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies of Group
entities at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at
the exchange rate at the reporting date. The foreign currency gain or loss on monetary items is the
difference between amortized cost in the functional currency at the beginning of the year, adjusted for
effective interest and payments during the year, and the amortized cost in foreign currency translated
at the exchange rate at the end of the year.

Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair
value are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at the date the fair value was
determined. Non-monetary items in a foreign currency that are measured based on historical cost are
translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.

Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are generally recognized in profit or loss,
except for the following differences which are recognized in other comprehensive income arising on the
retranslation of:

    - available-for-sale equity investments (except on impairment in which case foreign currency
differences that have been recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to
profit or loss);

76


-----

    - financial liabilities designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation to the
extent that the hedge is effective; or

    - qualifying cash flow hedges to the extent the hedge is effective.

_Foreign Operations_

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments
arising on acquisition, are translated to euro at exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and
expenses of foreign operations are translated to euro at exchange rates at the dates of the
transactions.

We do not own or control any material foreign operations in hyperinflationary economies.

Foreign currency differences are recognized in other comprehensive income, and accumulated in
the foreign currency translation reserve (the “Translation Reserve”) in equity. However, if the foreign
operation is a non-wholly owned subsidiary, then the relevant proportion of the translation difference is
allocated to relevant non-controlling interests.

When a foreign operation is disposed of such that control, significant influence or joint control is
lost, the cumulative amount in the Translation Reserve related to that foreign operation is reclassified
to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. When we dispose of only part of our interest in a
subsidiary that includes a foreign operation while retaining control, the relevant proportion of the
cumulative amount is reattributed to non-controlling interests. When we dispose of only part of our
investment in an associate or joint venture that includes a foreign operation while retaining significant
influence or joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or
loss.

When the settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is
neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, foreign currency gains and losses arising from such
item are considered to form part of a net investment in the foreign operation and are recognized in
other comprehensive income, and presented in the Translation Reserve in equity.

**_Income Tax_**

Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax are recognized in
profit or loss except to the extent that they relate to a business combination, or items recognized
directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.

_Current Tax_

Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the period,
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustments to tax
payable in respect of previous years. Current tax payable also includes any tax liability arising from the
declaration of dividends.

_Deferred Tax_

Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax is not recognized for:

    - temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is
not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;

    - temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities to
the extent that it is probable that such temporary differences will not reverse in the
foreseeable future; and

    - taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.

77


-----

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences
when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current
tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable
entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net
basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously.

A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary
differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which
they can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the
extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized. Unrecognized deferred
tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognized to the extent that it has become
probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

**_IFRS 16 Leases_**

IFRS 16 introduces a single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model for lessees. A lessee
recognizes a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability
representing its obligations to make lease payments for all leases with a term of more than 12 months,
unless the underlying asset is of low value. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods
beginning on or after January 1, 2019. The Group has a significant number of operating lease
contracts, mainly for real estate, and therefore significant changes are expected upon transition to
IFRS 16. It is not currently possible to quantify the impact as it will be dependent on the finalization of
our detailed assessment, as well as accounting policy elections and judgments that should be
considered before applying the new standard.

**The Expert Administrative Services Market**

**_Market_**

The global expert administrative services industry is a key component of the global asset
management network. The industry provides a wide range of value-added administrative services to
clients, assisting them in setting up, managing, monitoring and unwinding their corporate, investment,
finance and fund entities within regulated markets. Expert administrative service providers also assist
clients in their compliance with relevant local and international regulations but typically do not provide
legal or tax advisory services, instead they implement legal and tax advice given by external lawyers,
tax advisers and accountants. These external advisers often act as business partners, referring clients
to expert administrative service providers.

The 13 key expert administrative services jurisdictions we primarily focus on include the US,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Jersey, Cayman Islands, Guernsey, Switzerland, Hong Kong, United
Kingdom, Ireland, Singapore, Curacao and Spain. Based on total revenue figures, these jurisdictions
together accounted for approximately €6.5 billion or 77% of revenue of the global expert administrative
services market in 2017, and together form our addressable market. Our addressable market is
expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 3% to 5% from 2018 to 2021. The below chart shows
the split of our addressable market over our five reporting segments for the year ended December 31,
2017:

NL 6%

LU

ROW 13%
34% JE

~  6.5bn 8%

Americas
39%

Note: The Americas includes the US, the Cayman Islands and Curacao; ROW includes Guernsey, Hong Kong, Singapore,
China, Spain, Ireland and UK; other market sizes are high-level estimates based on number of expert administrative
services licenses and number of entities in jurisdictions

Important factors which determine a jurisdiction’s attractiveness for the expert administrative
services industry are international reputation, legal environment, bilateral asset protection treaties,
infrastructure and local expertise. In particular, the sophistication, predictability and stability of a
jurisdiction’s legislative, regulatory and judiciary landscape are important. The global expert
administrative services market is comprised of approximately 80 jurisdictions.

Each jurisdiction typically attracts a specific set of clients depending on the above factors. Due to
our focus on Corporates and Funds clients, we consider the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Jersey and the
Americas (consisting primarily of the US, Curacao and the Cayman Islands) our four main reporting
segments, which together accounted for approximately €4.4 billion or approximately 50% of revenue of
the global expert administrative services market in 2017, and comprise the jurisdictions where most of
our revenue generating clients are located.

79


-----

The expert administrative services market is highly fragmented with many providers worldwide,
most of whom operate on a local basis with a limited service offering. We are one of the few global
service providers, with geographic coverage in 29 jurisdictions across all continents in the expert
administrative services market. Other global players include TMF Group, Vistra, SGG and Citco, based
on presence in multiple jurisdictions. We aim to differentiate ourselves from our competitors through
our global presence, our economies of scale, and our wider service offering of high value services such
as process agent, ManCo services, regulatory and compliance services. Other expert administrative
service providers include, on the one hand, multi-regional and regional providers, who offer a broad
range of services but focus on specific jurisdictions in one or more regions, and, on the other hand,
medium-sized and local providers, who have a narrower service offering and a smaller geographical
coverage. Some major banks, fund administrators, legal and accounting firms also compete in specific
service lines.

**_Clients_**

The client base in the expert administrative services industry can be divided into four categories:

**Corporates clients, including multinational corporations and small and medium enterprises,**
which accounted for approximately €2.2 billion or 35% of the €6.5 billion revenue of the expert
administrative services market in the 13 key jurisdictions we focus on in 2017;

**Funds clients, including alternative investment funds (including private equity, hedge funds and**
real estate funds) and retail funds, which accounted for approximately €1.8 billion or 28% of the
€6.5 billion revenue of the expert administrative services market in the 13 key jurisdictions we focus on
in 2017;

**Capital Markets clients, including securitization and structured finance clients and alternative**
finance providers, which accounted for approximately €1.1 billion or 17% of the €6.5 billion revenue of
the expert administrative services market in the 13 key jurisdictions we focus on in 2017; and

**Private Wealth clients, including family offices, high net worth individuals (“HNWI”), ultra high net**
worth individuals (“UHNWI”) and entrepreneurs, which accounted for approximately €1.3 billion or 20%
of the €6.5 billion revenue of the expert administrative services market in the 13 key jurisdictions we
focus on in 2017.

**_Services_**

All client categories generally require services with respect to the formation and implementation of
entities, the domiciliation and management of entities, legal administration (including company
secretarial) and accounting and reporting. The particular scope of service that a client requires
depends on the category of client and the level of substance required in a relevant jurisdiction.
Substance refers to the creation of a presence through office and decision-making processes in a local
jurisdiction. In addition to general services, there are specific services relevant to particular client
categories. These include, for example, depositary or ManCo services for Funds clients, and portfolio
administration services or process agency for Capital Markets clients.

**_Service characteristics_**

Expert administrative services facilitate cross-border investments and acquisitions, with a mix of
business, legal and tax considerations. Business and legal considerations include risk management
and asset protection, well-established location for establishment of investment funds, neutrality for
international joint ventures (i.e., a neutral jurisdiction providing a level playing field for the joint venture
partners), legal certainty, political, financial and regulatory stability, access to capital markets,
availability of experienced workforce, network of professional advisors (bankers, lawyers, auditors and
consultants), travel connections, range and characteristics of available legal entity forms and cost of
incorporation, maintenance and liquidation. Tax considerations can include attractiveness of local tax
legislation (for example, local tax rates and participation exemption) and mitigation of double taxation
(for example, double taxation treaty network).

Expert administrative service providers cover the entire life cycle of a client entity from
incorporation, through to ongoing maintenance and compliance and the eventual liquidation. The
average life of a client entity is estimated at approximately five to ten years, which typically results in
predictable and recurring revenue for expert administrative service providers. Switching service
providers during the life of a client entity can be cumbersome, costly, and may risk financial penalties
and reputational damage if the new provider is unable to meet regulatory requirements to the
necessary standard, which results in client retention and high revenue visibility. On average,
maintenance activities such as domiciliation, management and trustee services, legal and tax
compliance services or accounting and reporting services, account for approximately 90% of the
revenue of expert administrative service providers whilst the remaining approximately 10% is split
between event driven services such as incorporation and liquidation activities.

Clients in the expert administrative services industry tend to attribute high value to quality of
service, reputation, personal relationships, expertise, reliability and responsiveness of service
providers. Due to the specialized nature of the services provided, expert administrative services
typically require specialist local expertise. The negative ramifications of errors, such as non-compliance
with local rules and regulations, can be significant. In addition, pricing of expert administrative services

81


-----

is generally considered low compared to the potential savings or efficiencies to be achieved. As such,
clients and business partners tend to be focused on securing high quality services and specific
expertise from reputable and global firms.

New business is either sourced through direct sales efforts or through existing clients, business
partners such as lawyers, tax advisers and accountants.

**Growth Drivers**

**_Globalization and Economic Growth_**

The expansion of the expert administrative services industry has been driven by the
internationalization of corporate and investment activities. As global assets under management
(“AuM”) continue to grow, stakeholders require expert administrative services to deploy and monitor
capital in ways which are compliant, transparent and ethical, and which fulfill specific legal,
administrative and regulatory requirements. As corporations invest across numerous jurisdictions, they
typically require expert administrative services to implement tax efficient entities and assist them in
their compliance with local and international standards.

The increase in globalization, expressed in terms of global trade, has been uninterrupted over the
period from 2005 to 2017 at a CAGR of 4%. Global gross domestic product (“GDP”) during the same
period has grown at a 4% CAGR. Going forward, global trade is expected to continue to grow at a
CAGR of approximately 4% between 2018 and 2023, approximately in line with the expected global
GDP growth of the same period.

AuM continue to grow rapidly, expecting to reach $145 trillion by 2025. Key drivers for this growth
are the burgeoning wealth of HNWI and an increasing affluent global population, as well as a shift to
defined contribution retirement saving. Alternative asset classes, in particular, real estate, private
equity, hedge funds, infrastructure funds and commodities, are expected to grow faster than other
asset classes at a CAGR of 8.7% between 2016 and 2025.

**_Regulation, Substance Requirements, Complexity of Client Entities, Demand For Additional_**
**_Services and Outsourcing_**

Increasing regulatory complexity is a key driver of growth in the expert administrative services
industry. The implementation of new regulation has increased substance and reporting requirements.
Furthermore, strengthened measures to prevent tax evasion, fraud and terrorist financing has
historically resulted in more complexity and increased demand for additional transparency, which
generally results in a greater administrative burden and higher costs of compliance. These trends have
historically offset initiatives aimed at regulatory and legal simplification or international harmonization.

Increased compliance requirements for clients drive the demand for transparency and substance
services, which in turn drives the expert administrative services billable hours per client entity. The
increasing complexity, administrative burden and attention to compliance for expert administrative
service providers means that smaller expert administrative service providers may not have the
appropriate infrastructure, scale or required expertise to continue to compete effectively, leading to
further client migration to high quality global players against the backdrop of increasing regulation,
increasingly global business and high costs of failure.

In 2013, OECD and G20 countries adopted a 15-point Action Plan on BEPS. BEPS relates
primarily to instances where the interaction of different tax rules leads to double non-taxation or less
than single taxation. It also relates to arrangements that achieve no or low taxation by shifting profits
away from the jurisdictions where those profits are generated. Following the release of the BEPS
package in October 2015, G20 leaders urged its timely implementation and called on OECD to develop
a more inclusive framework with the involvement of interested non-G20 countries and jurisdictions,
including developing economies. The OECD established the “Inclusive Framework on BEPS” in June
2016 so that all interested countries and jurisdictions can work together. Over 115 countries and
jurisdictions have joined on an equal footing in developing standards on BEPS- related issues and
reviewing and monitoring its consistent implementation. In order to implement the anti-BEPS measures

82


-----

at the EU level, the EU adopted ATAD, a minimum directive to be obliged by Member States in June
2016, consisting of five legally binding anti-abuse measures, which all Member States should apply
against common forms of aggressive tax planning as from January 1, 2019.

The implementation of BEPS and ATAD is expected to bring opportunities to the expert
administrative services market as well as adverse impacts:

    - increased substance requirement in certain countries may increase the number of entities,
billable hours, and price per hour, whilst the number of structures may decrease as pressure
on structures set up in low-tax jurisdictions heightens;

    - certain structures that are currently serviced by the expert administration services industry
may no longer be viable and disappear; and

    - individual jurisdiction attractiveness may change as a result of implementation by individual
countries, negatively impacting some jurisdictions and positively impacting other jurisdictions.

overall expert administrative services market.

**Increased service requirements** **Increased outsourcing**

As a result of increased regulatory complexity, outsourcing has increased as clients no longer
have or wish to invest in expertise or resources to perform the required services in-house. The growth
of outsourcing also reflects an increasing focus of organizations on their core capabilities. External
expert administrative service providers have the professional know-how to ensure certainty of
compliance, the potential to offer significant cost savings to clients, and improved service because of
their specialized capabilities and greater scale. This is particularly the case for activities where
in-house provision would result in sub-scale operations or where limited internal institutional knowledge
exists, as is often the case for support functions in new geographic markets.

**Key Industry Trends**

The expert administrative services market has historically been growing at a faster pace than
macro-economic growth (indicated by global GDP growth). Whilst this relatively strong growth is a
continuation of historic performance, the composition of this growth is shifting, with the Funds service
line becoming a more important growth driver.

Funds are seeing the strongest growth across all client categories, driven by the continued
underlying volume growth on the back of increasing flow of capital into private equity and real estate
funds asset classes. Another strong contributor to Funds growth is the trend to outsource fund
administration activities, resulting in additional services offerings.

Opportunities for new services in the Corporates service line have grown, given tightening
regulatory requirements. Despite the outflow of certain structures types (particularly aggressive tax
structuring) due to stricter regulation and focus of governments on curtailing tax evasion and creating
level-playing fields, real substance structures will remain and will likely see increasing billable hours of
services.

The Private Wealth service line is also undergoing a shift in structure due to increasing regulatory
requirements and recent negative publicity (for example, the Panama Papers). On the lower end of this
service line, simple structures are under pressure, although there are continued opportunities for
corporate-like structures and family offices.

In addition to the drivers above, the following trends affect the competitive landscape in the
industry:

    - consolidation: expert administrative services is a fragmented industry in which smaller players
may find it difficult to operate in light of the growing regulatory complexity, increase scale in
existing jurisdictions and acquire complementary substance services or expand their
geographic footprint. Smaller players are often bound to certain jurisdictions and are less
familiar with global legislation. They also face the risk of client attrition when clients seek to
relocate to other jurisdictions where the smaller player does not have a presence, restricting
their attractiveness to large clients. Larger providers on the other hand are able to adapt to
changes in law quickly and have the scale to invest in capacity and capabilities (for example,
global knowledge development and information technology resources). Large players have
been able to expand through acquisitions that help them to broaden their service portfolio and
geographic reach, and capture market share; and

    - client preferences: as a result of globalization, there is a preference from clients to work with a
single expert administrative services provider with a full service proposition and a global
reach.

**Historical and Forecasted Industry Growth**

The expert administrative services industry has experienced revenue growth in the period from
2010 to 2017, with different service lines affected differently by general economic growth. The expert
corporate and fund services market has demonstrated a long-term resilient growth above GDP over
the last ten years. The below chart shows the growth trend of the expert corporate and fund solutions

Our main geographic markets, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Jersey and the Americas, which
accounted for 74.1% of our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, grew at a CAGR
of approximately 4% during the period from 2015 to 2017 to reach total revenue of €4.4 billion in 2017.
Historically, the industry has been able to generate a resilient revenue stream, largely due to the fact
that approximately 90% of total revenue is recurring maintenance in nature. The remaining
approximately 10% of revenue consists of formation and implementation services (approximately 5%)
and liquidation services (approximately 5%), which have the characteristics of natural hedge with
opposing correlations with economic growth. Naturally, incorporation activities will demonstrate an
upward trend in booming economy whilst liquidation will subside and the reverse tends to happen in
contracting economy. Between 2018 and 2021, our key geographic markets are expected to show a
CAGR of 4%.

**Regional Market Overview**

**_The Netherlands_**

_Market Size, Growth and Composition_

The total revenue of the expert administrative services market in the Netherlands was
approximately €350 to €380 million in 2017. The majority of the clients in the Dutch expert
administrative services market in 2017 resided in Europe (66%) and North America (15%), with the
remainder mainly from the Asia Pacific region. Clients comprise primarily of Corporates clients (73%),
with the remainder being Funds (12%), Private Wealth (7%) and Capital Markets clients (8%). A key
attraction of the Dutch market for corporate clients is the extensive network of tax treaties and financial
stability of the market.

The Netherlands remains one of the most attractive jurisdictions for the Corporates service line
clients given the high number of tax treaties, although BEPS, the MLI, ATAD and critical public opinion
have recently and are further expected to negatively impact its position. In terms of revenue, the expert
administrative services market in the Netherlands grew at a CAGR of 5% per year in the period from
2011 to 2016, but it experienced downsizing for the first time in 2017 and is expected to continue to
demonstrate a similar pattern until 2020 before picking up in 2021. The principal driver for this
decrease is the decline in the number of entities under maintenance as fewer Corporates clients are
establishing holding companies in the Netherlands and are more quickly liquidating small entities. To
offset the outflow of entities, remaining entities are expected to drive revenue per entity as a result of
increased substance and compliance requirements.

_Competitive Environment_

The expert administrative services market in the Netherlands is fragmented with a relatively stable
group of competitors. We consider ourselves to be the market leader with an estimated market share
of approximately 31% by revenue as of 2017. The only other main global player in the Dutch expert
administrative services market is TMF Group (approximately 18% market share). A few regional
players such as SGG and Vistra also have meaningful market shares in the Corporates service line.
The Funds service line is fragmented with global players such as TMF, Citco and Vistra taking up
approximately 60% of the market, banks with 30% of the market, and other local players the remaining
10%. Typically these players tailor their services to larger clients and manage high volumes of more
complex entities on clients’ behalf. The remainder of the market is comprised of small, local players
which generally service less complex entities with locally based clients.

_Regulatory Environment_

The Netherlands has a long tradition of political and social stability, with sophisticated legislation
and a highly reputable and consistent fiscal system. The Netherlands is a popular location in Europe to
establish a base for international operations and multinational group entities to structure complex
transactions. For example, certain qualifying corporations benefit from the participation exemption in
the Netherlands, which provides a tax exemption for dividends and capital gains of qualifying
subsidiaries. In addition to the strong international business climate and excellent infrastructure, the

86


-----

Netherlands also has high number of tax treaties, jurisdiction-specific tax advantages, liberal foreign
exchange regulations and efficient and flexible incorporation procedures for Dutch legal entities. This
makes the Netherlands an attractive base for domiciling international business operations. The expert
administrative services market is further supported by the availability of a highly skilled workforce,
positioning the Netherlands as an important jurisdiction within the expert administrative services market
globally. Expert administrative services activities are subject to the supervision of the Dutch Central
Bank, which acts as the primary regulator of the industry.

On September 18, 2018, the Dutch government presented the 2019 Dutch central government
budget and the budget memorandum to the Dutch parliament (Staten Generaal) with further clarity on
tax regime changes that will potentially impact the attractiveness of the Netherlands for the expert
administrative services market. On October 5, 2018, the Dutch government announced that it was
reconsidering certain measures included in the 2019 Dutch central government budget to increase the
attractiveness of the Dutch business and investment climate. On October 15, 2018, the Dutch
government officially announced the repeal of the previously announced proposal to eliminate the
dividend withholding tax. At the same time, the Dutch government announced a further gradual
reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 25% in 2018 to 20.5% in 2021, and its plans to revisit
and defer the previously announced proposal to implement a conditional dividend withholding tax. We
expect that companies with real economic activities and holding companies with substance should in
particular benefit from these amendments. However, various anti-abuse provisions were also
introduced in the budget memorandum. In particular, earning stripping rules, controlled foreign
companies (“CFCs”) and anti-hybrid rules will cause challenges for expert administrative service
providers. Overall, the change in Dutch environment is likely to have a mixed effect with more positives
than negatives, given increased requirements for substance, which is expected to lead to more billable
hours and also higher revenue per billable hour.

**_Luxembourg_**

_Market Size, Growth and Composition_

The total revenue of the expert administrative services market in Luxembourg was approximately
€820 to €860 million in 2017. About 37% of the client base is estimated to consist of Corporates
clients, 45% of Funds, 14% of Capital Markets clients and the remaining 5% of Private Wealth clients.
The majority of clients are from Europe (71%) and North America (13%). A key attraction of the
Luxembourg market, predominantly for Funds and Corporates clients, is the attractive regulatory
environment along with a reputation as a stable banking hub.

In terms of revenue, Luxembourg’s expert administrative services market grew at a 7% CAGR
between 2013 and 2017, and is expected to grow at a faster pace of 8% in the period between 2018
and 2021, primarily driven by strong underlying growth in the Funds service line and the relatively
limited impact of BEPS. The total revenue of the expert administrative services market in Luxembourg
is expected to reach a value of approximately €1.1 billion in revenue in 2021.

_Competitive Environment_

The Luxembourg expert administrative services market is fragmented, with the majority of the
market comprised of small players with less than 5% market share each. We are one of the two largest
players in the market based on revenue with an estimated market share of approximately 11%, at par
with Alter Domus (11% market share), followed by SGG (8% market share), TMF Group (6% market
share) and Vistra (3% market share).

_Regulatory Environment_

Luxembourg has a favorable regulatory environment which is promoted by the government as well
as the private sector. Luxembourg has high economic standards and stability, characterized by
banking, fund and tax advisor expertise, a well-educated workforce, high quality resources and
infrastructure, predictable banking and legislative traditions and accommodating policies towards

foreign investments. Similar to the Netherlands, Luxembourg has a favorable participation exemption,
which adds to its attractiveness as an expert administrative services market. Furthermore, Luxembourg
has an extensive tax treaty network, consisting of 83 bilateral tax treaties. The tax regime is facilitated
through four main legal forms of investment vehicles (Société de Participations Financières, Société
_d’investissement en Capital à Risque, Société de Gestion de Patrimoine Familial and the Specialized_
Investment Fund), which offer flexible and tax-efficient holdings, further attracting a global clientele.

The expert administrative services market in Luxembourg is supervised by the Luxembourg
Commission for the Supervision of the Financial Sector (Commission de Surveillance du Secteur
_Financier, or “CSSF”)._

**_The Cayman Islands_**

_Market Size, Growth and Composition_

The total revenue of the expert administrative services market in the Cayman Islands was
approximately €520 to €580 million in 2017. The market is mainly characterized by Funds clients
(52%) with the remainder of the market consisting of Corporates clients (26%), Capital Markets clients
(12%) and Private Wealth clients (10%). The majority of clients are from North America (65%). The
Cayman Islands market is a key jurisdiction for hedge fund domiciliation due to the absence of tax on
income, profits, assets and capital gains. The key attraction of the Cayman Islands market is the
benign tax environment, along with the profound expertise in hedge funds and banking, which makes
the jurisdiction popular for both Corporates as well as Private Wealth clients.

Historically, gross inflow of entities has been impacted by GDP in the country of origin and private
equity, hedge fund and M&A deal activity. Based on revenue, the Cayman Islands market has grown
with a CAGR of 4% between 2013 and 2017. The Cayman Islands is a mature market that is expected
to grow at a stable pace of 4.5% between 2018 and 2021. Revenue from SPV services for hedge funds
are a key part of the market, and so the Cayman Islands are expected to see future growth from capital
flows to hedge funds, private equity and real estate funds. There have been signs of slowed growth in
the Corporates and Private Wealth service line due to the implementation of FATCA requirements. The
total revenue of the expert administrative services market in the Cayman Islands is expected to reach a
value of approximately €650 million in revenue in 2021.

_Competitive Environment_

We are the second largest independent expert administrative service provider in the Cayman
Islands, with an estimated market share of approximately 18% in 2017. The largest player, Maples,
held a market share of approximately 24% in 2017. Other players including DMS (approximately 10%),
Citco (approximately 5%) and Walkers (approximately 5%), whilst other bank fund administrators have
a smaller share of the total Cayman Islands market. The remainder of the market is serviced by local
accounting and law firms as well as niche administrators, which offer a combination of expert
administrative services and legal services.

_Regulatory Environment_

The benefits of the tax neutrality of the Cayman Islands have made it one of the most popular
jurisdictions for funds and tax-efficient client entities for corporations. The Cayman Islands’ financial
attractiveness for the Funds, Corporates and Private Wealth service lines is driven by the absence of
tax on income, profits, assets and capital gains. For global expert administrative service providers, the
Cayman Islands serve as a gateway to access the US client base. The Cayman Islands operates
under a stringent regulatory environment, supervised by the “Cayman Islands Monetary Authority.”

The Cayman Islands expert administrative services market has been impacted by regulatory
changes in certain countries of residency of the ultimate beneficial owners of Cayman-based expert
administrative service client entities, especially in the US. New regulation (such as the FATCA, the
OECD’s Common Reporting Standard (“CRS”) and the AIFMD) drives only a limited shift to US and EU
jurisdictions, since expert administrative service providers in the Cayman Islands are able to offer
FATCA, CRS and AIFMD compliant services.

**_Jersey_**

_Market Size, Growth and Composition_

The total revenue of the expert administrative service market in Jersey was approximately €550 to
€600 million in 2017. Jersey has a solid international reputation regarding provision of expert
administrative services across client categories due to its attractive taxation for Corporates and Private
Wealth clients. The market is split roughly evenly among Private Wealth, Corporates and Funds in
Jersey, who account for 36%, 32% and 31% of revenue of the expert administrative service market in
Jersey in 2017, respectively. Jersey attracts Private Wealth clients with its friendly tax rules (for
example, no capital gain tax or dividend tax) and its government’s desire to maintain an advantageous
tax system. Compared to the Netherlands and Luxembourg, Jersey has limited tax treaties, however it
has an attractive tax policy for Corporates clients, which makes it a popular jurisdiction for companies
to set up entities.

In the past five years, as a mature market, Jersey’s entity volume growth has been broadly flat as
a loss in liquidation activity is largely offset by an increase in incorporation and maintenance activities.
However, increasingly complex regulatory requirements has resulted in significant growth in the hours
required per entity under maintenance. This is reflected by a 3% annualized revenue growth between
2013 and 2017. Total market size is expected to continue to grow at an annualized rate of 3% between
2018 and 2021, reaching a value of approximately €650 million in revenue in 2021.

_Competitive Environment_

The Jersey expert administrative services market is fragmented, with a large number of licensed
providers and no single provider occupying more than 10% of the market share. With an estimated
market share of approximately 10% in 2017, we are the leading provider in Jersey. Sanne and Estera
also hold meaningful positions in Jersey market with 5% and 4% market share respectively. Aztec
Group is the largest player in the Funds service line but does not service all service lines. We are the
only player in the Jersey market with the capability to provide a full range of services across
Corporates, Funds, Capital Markets and Private Wealth service lines. Our scale, reputation and brand
recognition ensure that we are well placed to gain market share in the current regulatory environment.

_Regulatory Environment_

Recent and upcoming legislation, including BEPS, AIFMD and FATCA, is expected to be positive
for the Jersey expert administrative services market. Although not binding by law, the OECD BEPS
action plan is likely to have a mixed impact on the Jersey market, as requirements for local presence
and value-added services may increase revenue per entity whilst perception of jurisdiction
attractiveness may be impacted by increasing political pressure and public scrutiny. Furthermore, the
implementation of AIFMD may cause clients outflow from Jersey to Luxembourg as the EU becomes
more attractive, which is expected to be partially be offset by the additional work required by AIFMD’s
increased compliance requirements. Overall the changing regulatory landscape may lead to a shift in
jurisdictional preference but also an increase the volume of services provided as clients could be
inclined to outsource on the back of increasing complexity.

**OUR KEY STRENGTHS**

**_Leading global provider in the expert administrative services industry with a comprehensive_**
**_service offering_**

We are a leading global provider of expert administrative services to clients operating and
investing internationally and as of December 31, 2017, based on revenue, we were the market leader
in the Netherlands and Jersey, the number two provider in Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands and
we had leading market positions in most of our key jurisdictions in the Rest of the World. As of
September 30, 2018, we operated from a global network of 41 offices in 29 jurisdictions from which we
administered approximately 48,300 entities for our clients, enabling them to grow successfully, operate
their businesses efficiently and responsibly and fulfill their international legal, administrative and
regulatory duties. In addition to our offices, as of September 30, 2018, we had a network of
approximately 40,000 business partner contacts (including in jurisdictions in which we were present),
who referred work to us, and a network of third-party service providers (“TPSPs”) in 144 jurisdictions in
which we did not have a presence, allowing us to assist our clients by referring them to our partners in
jurisdictions where we do not have an operational presence. Our leading global position provides an
advantage over smaller providers who may provide a narrower service offering or who operate in fewer
jurisdictions.

We provide a wide range of expert administrative services to our clients across our service lines:
Corporates; Funds; Capital Markets and Private Wealth. We also provide various regulatory and
compliance services which are offered across all our four service lines. Our services are supported by
our continuously developing technology foundation and include core services offered in nearly all
offices and more specialized services provided from selected locations. We are an experienced and
expert player, servicing our clients for 66 years in an increasingly complex global environment and a

market becoming increasingly focused on quality. Our customers have come to trust our reputable and
global brand to deliver mission critical services.

**_Global secular and sustainable growth factors across highly regulated markets_**

Our addressable market, representing our service lines in the 13 key expert administrative
services jurisdictions (including the US, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the Cayman Islands, Jersey,
Guernsey, Switzerland, Hong Kong, the UK, Ireland, Singapore, Curacao and Spain) which we
primarily focus on is approximately €6.5 billion in size and has grown at approximately 3% to 5%
annually between 2015 and 2018, driven by growth in most of our service lines. Our Funds service line
is currently within the fastest growing market among our service lines, with annualized forecast growth
of 7% to 9% for the period from 2018 to 2021. Our clients operate in an increasingly complex global
environment focused on compliance, business ethics and transparency and we have a strong track
record of successful cooperation with regulators in key jurisdictions. Regulation is an important and
resilient driver of our market growth, in addition to increased complexity and specialization of the
services that our clients require. Historically, we have seen the consistent introduction of regulation,
and the pace and magnitude of change is increasing. As such, our client entities often require
additional services in order to ensure compliance with new regulations, resulting in higher ARPE
across our service lines. There are a number of ongoing and future regulation initiatives which
represent further opportunity, such as the Fourth and Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (“AMLD”)
and the US tax reform as well as potential legislation concerning the upcoming departure of the UK
from the EU (“Brexit”). In addition to increasing global regulation, our addressable market benefits
from a number of other underlying and continued drivers of growth:

    - _Globalization, Economic Growth and M&A Activity. Our markets are continuing to grow due to_
the increased internationalization of corporate and investment activities. As global assets
under management continue to grow, our clients require our services in order to deploy and
monitor capital in a way which is compliant, transparent and ethical and which fulfills specific
legal, administrative and regulatory duties. Corporations investing across numerous
jurisdictions require our services to implement tax efficient entities and assist them in
compliance with both local and international standards. Regulatory developments and
changes in the tax environment (such as the Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting
(“BEPS”), the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (“ATAD”) and the Multilateral Convention to
Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) may
result in greater services per entity to maintain compliance, while reducing entity growth in
certain jurisdictions.

    - _Regulation, Substance Requirements, Complexity of Client Entities, Need of Additional_
_Services and Outsourcing. In addition to increasing regulatory complexity, increasing_
compliance requirements for clients drive the demand for transparency and substance related
services (which in turn drives billable hours per entity and ARPE). Clients are increasingly
relying on expert external providers to handle growing regulatory, risk management and
compliance requirements due to their specialized capabilities and greater scale. This
increased outsourcing allows organizations to focus on their core capabilities, reduce
administrative burden, manage costs and reduce organizational complexity.

**_Resilient business model providing mandatory and “mission critical” services on a recurring_**
**_basis._**

We provide mission critical, non-discretionary services, which help to ensure that clients are
compliant with relevant regulations and are therefore considered critical from a legal, regulatory,
financial, reputational and risk management perspective. For our clients, the costs associated with
providing our range of administrative services are often considered to be non-discretionary, since our
clients generally require these services irrespective of their financial or operational performance, given
the costs of failure can be high, both in terms of the severity of penalties (including fines or criminal
prosecution) and the potential reputational damage suffered as a result of non-compliance.

We estimate that approximately 90% of our total revenue is generated by on-going compliance
and maintenance services of client entities which for the most part can be considered as recurring. The
remaining 10% relates to non-recurring revenue such as revenue generated by incorporations and
liquidations.

92


-----

Our business model benefits from added resilience due to the high-cost of switching administrative
service providers, both financially and through the risk that critical services might not be provided to the
same quality. In addition, the non-discretionary nature of our offering means that macro-economic
fluctuations have historically had limited impact on our industry as expert administrative services
required are not dependent on financial or operational performance. Our wide range of expert
administrative services provides a complete solution for both event driven demands and for the
ongoing requirements of doing business.

**_Diversified client base across service lines and geographies_**

Our longstanding clients are diversified across our service lines: Corporates; Funds; Capital
Markets; and Private Wealth. In addition our clients are also diversified across geographies. As of
September 30, 2018, we had clients based in approximately 140 jurisdictions and were not reliant on
any single jurisdiction for our revenue. The Netherlands accounted for €116.4 million (23.7%),
Luxembourg for €105.2 million (21.4%), the Americas for €85.1 million (17.3%), Jersey for
€57.6 million (11.7%) and the Rest of the World for €126.5 million (25.8%) of our revenue for the
twelve months ended September 30, 2018 amounting to €490.8 million. Similarly, we had a diversified
client portfolio with our ten largest clients accounting for approximately 8% of our revenue for the year
ended December 31, 2017, and none of our clients representing more than 1.6%.

Our wide range of services provides a diversified product offering, including core services such as
incorporation, management, legal and tax compliance, reporting and liquidation, and also specialized
services such as fund administration, depository services, portfolio administrative services, treasury
and investment services and investor reporting. Core services are offered across all our four service
lines, whereas specialized services are more specific to the relevant service line. Core services
represented approximately 75% of our revenue in the twelve months ended September 30, 2018, and
our specialized services represented approximately 25% of our revenue in the twelve months ended
September 30, 2018.

We have a high quality client base representing a broad array of industries and are focused on
multinational corporations, financial institutions, fund managers, high net worth individuals and family
offices. As of September 30, 2018, our client base included 60% of the Top 10 and 50% of the Top 50
Fortune 500 companies as well as 80% of the Top 50 of the Private Equity International Top 300. Our
longstanding relationship with our high quality clients supports our ability to secure multi-year contracts
and to cross-sell our wide range of services.

**_Proven track record of synergetic acquisitions and well positioned for further consolidation in a_**
**_fragmented industry_**

We have a proven track record for successful and value-accretive acquisitions in a historically
fragmented market, completing eight selective and successful acquisitions since 2011. Our number of
client entities grew from approximately 40,000 at the end of 2015 to approximately 50,400 at the end of
2017, primarily as a result of strategic acquisitions. Our number of FTEs grew from approximately
1,700 at the end of 2015 to approximately 2,500 as of September 30, 2018, approximately 650 of
which were attributable to our strategic acquisitions. We aim to capture and diversify our service
offering and our strategic rationale is to further increase scale, provide complementary services,
expand our footprint and acquire technology enablers. For example, our acquisition of Elian in
September 2016 strengthened our capital markets, as well as our private equity and real estate fund
administration services, expanded our geographic presence to Jersey and added scale in other key
jurisdictions such as Ireland, the United Kingdom and the Cayman Islands.

We have instituted acquisition and integration procedures aimed at identifying and assessing
targets against clear strategic rationale and priorities, as well as potential risks and are selective
through strict criteria such as: revenue growth and profitability; potential to fit into and complement our
business; and quality of client portfolio. We have a robust internal M&A process framework in place
with oversight and final sign-off provided at the Parent Guarantor’s supervisory board (“Supervisory
**Board”) level and procedures for integration to ensure risk mitigation. Integration is focused on**
fostering organic growth and our aim is to retain services of key individuals and clients.

93


-----

There are further opportunities for consolidation within the fragmented expert administrative
services market and we are in a strong position to source value-enhancing opportunities and extract
synergies given our global platform and wide-reaching in-jurisdiction presence, with a clear focus on
verticalization and expansion into selected new jurisdictions and regions such as the US and the Asia
Pacific region and expansion and diversification of our services in new and existing sectors such as
private equity and real estate fund administration, compliance services and capital markets.

**_Industry leading risk management standards_**

As a global player, we have enjoyed the reputation of applying high compliance and risk
management standards across our global network as the potential failure by us in this regard could
have a material adverse effect across our business. The responsibility for establishment and oversight
of our risk management framework lies within our management board (“Management Board”), but we
have also adopted a “three lines of defense” model to manage our risk:

_First line of defense—Business: Our business teams bear primary responsibility for identifying,_
controlling and monitoring the risks within their processes, maintaining effective internal control
frameworks and adhering to global compliance policies and standards.

_Second_ _line_ _of_ _defense—Compliance_ _and_ _Risk_ _Management:_ Our compliance and risk
management team (“Compliance and Risk Management team”) is globally responsible for
coordinating, developing and monitoring our risk management processes and adherence to
compliance standards and procedures. The Compliance and Risk Management team is responsible for
providing the independent risk reports to the executive committee (“Executive Committee”), our
Supervisory Board and our audit and risk committee (“Audit and Risk Committee”). The Compliance
and Risk Management team also monitors changes that may impact the risk profile of the business and
whether it is appropriate to provide new services to existing clients. The Compliance and Risk
Management team further ensures that employees in every office receive compliance training, in
addition to the mandatory Group-wide e-learning courses on anti-money laundering (“AML”) and other
relevant topics.

_Third line of defense—Internal Audit: The independent internal audit team (“Internal Audit team”)_
conducts audits that provide insights into how and to what extent we control the risks that may
jeopardize our strategic and other objectives. These audits provide management with additional
assurance on the effectiveness of internal controls and risk management.

**_High margins and strong cash flow generation_**

Our business model has historically demonstrated consistently high and stable margins and is
highly cash generative, with Adjusted EBITDA margins of 40.3% for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2018, and 40.4%, 42.1% and 42.8% for the years ended December 2017, 2016 and
2015, respectively. Similarly, our Adjusted EBITA margins were 38.1% for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2018, and 38.2%, 39.9% and 40.7% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and
2015, respectively.

As a provider of expert administrative services, we have relatively limited requirements for capital
expenditure such as investment in property, plant and equipment. Since 2015, total capital expenditure
has been below 4% of revenue. Operational efficiencies are additionally supported by our continued
focus on and investment in our IT systems and technology foundation, for which we have reduced the
number of data centers in use and have enhanced the speed to market of new applications such as
client portals. We have low effective tax rates in our key markets (the Netherlands, Luxembourg, the
Cayman Islands and Jersey) and low net working capital requirements. As a result, we have strong
cash generation.

**_Experienced management team with a clear strategy, supported by dynamic and engaged talent_**
**_pool_**

The transition of our management team is now complete. Our management team benefits from an
average experience of approximately 20 years in the financial services industry and has implemented a

94


-----

clear strategy focused on clients and services, innovation and technology and our people in order to
achieve operational excellence. In addition, our management was supported by a dynamic and
engaged global talent pool with more than 2,500 employees from 87 nationalities, as of September 30,
2018, the majority of whom have higher education degrees or qualifications. Our employees include
trained financial experts, lawyers, tax lawyers and accountants with 74.6% of employees in billable
FTE roles as of September 30, 2018.

We emphasize the importance of developing and maintaining our talent through strong teams,
creating platforms for personal and professional growth and a values-focused culture based on our four
key values: responsiveness; innovation; collaboration; and excellence. For example, we developed the
Global Mobility Program, in which we seek to support the international mobility of our staff with a view
to further developing the skillsets of our employees and further increasing cooperation, knowledge
sharing and cross-selling across our global network, and the Global Intertrust Academy, in which we
train and educate our employees on technical skills, as well as leadership, business development and
relationship management skills.

**OUR PURPOSE AND STRATEGY**

In an increasingly complex global environment, we help our clients with their administrative
challenges to grow and implement solutions to operate their business efficiently and responsibly.
Focusing on compliance, business ethics and transparency, we support our clients in fulfilling their
legal, administrative and regulatory duties in international business. We seek to consistently and
clearly communicate our strategy to ensure all stakeholders understand how we deliver value.

**_Capture opportunities to expand and diversify our service offering both organically and_**
**_through M&A activity_**

We seek opportunities to expand and diversify our service offering across all service lines in
existing and new jurisdictions. With a more complete service offering, we are able to target increased
levels of cross-selling revenue from other service lines, and increased revenue for clients and entities
requiring more complex service requirements and substance. We recently created a global client
solutions team to further accelerate our services and product development as we aim to adapt to the
changing needs of our clients.

In our Corporates service line, we seek to grow and diversify our service offering primarily within
specialized services in existing jurisdictions. Identified growth areas include the development and
rollout of integrated office solutions (“IOS”) and global corporate secretarial (“CoSec”) solutions; the
rollout of our performance and reward management (“PRM”) services in other key jurisdictions of our
Rest of the World segment; growing our recruitment and payroll services; and expanding our global
footprint to new jurisdictions.

In our Funds service line, we see opportunities in existing and new geographies including
Luxembourg, Ireland, Spain, Jersey and the Americas. Key growth areas include expansion of private
equity and real estate fund administration; broadening our management company (“ManCo”) services
and fund services administration in Luxembourg and Ireland respectively; introducing outsourced
fiduciary services such as assisting the money laundering reporting officer (“MLRO”) and the money
laundering compliance officer (“MLCO”) of our clients with investor onboarding procedures; expanding
our compliance services, especially alternative investment fund managers (“AIFM”), AML and
customer due diligence (“CDD”) compliance; and leveraging our specialized sales force in the UK and
the US.

In our Capital Markets service line, we see the opportunity to offer domestic services in the US
and the Asia Pacific region; grow our debt capital market services in the US and in Europe; and
leverage our specialized sales force in the UK and the US.

In our Private Wealth service line, we see the opportunity to grow our ability to support family
offices with CoSec and accounting services; facilitate the globalization of multi-generational family
wealth and increase cross-selling towards our Corporates service line.

95


-----

In addition to organic initiatives, we aim to increase our scale, complement our service offering,
expand our footprint and enhance our technology by pursuing selective and value enhancing
acquisitions. Over the past eight years, we have demonstrated our ability to identify, execute and
integrate acquisitions in the expert administrative services industry with the acquisitions of Close
Brothers Cayman, WMS, ATC, CRS, CorpNordic, Elian, SFM Spain and Azcona as well as Seed
Outsourcing. We intend to continue to take a disciplined and selective approach to pursue strategic
acquisitions and to apply a strict set of selection criteria when evaluating potential acquisition
candidates with a clear focus on strategic growth.

**_Develop our financial policy to serve our growth strategies_**

We intend to further strengthen and develop our financial policy in order to serve our growth
strategies and the expansion and diversification of our service offering. This includes targeting a net
leverage of approximately 3.0x in the absence of M&A. In terms of liquidity, we expect to have the
borrowings available under the New Revolving Credit Facility, and a minimum cash balance for
operations of €40 million. Under our dividend policy we expect to target a dividend payout of
approximately 40% of adjusted net income, with opportunistic share buy-backs subject to our net
leverage target. Under our M&A strategy we expect to continue to selectively pursue value accretive
acquisitions on the back of a strong M&A track record, and we intend to maintain a strong cash flow
profile supporting inorganic expansion. Under our hedging policy we intend to use interest rate swaps
for approximately 50% of our floating rate debt, with no foreign exchange hedging and an external debt
mix expected to reflect the foreign exchange mix in our Adjusted EBITDA.

**_Further develop our technology foundation to serve changing client needs_**

Our ambition is to further develop our technology foundation to serve client needs. We seek to
provide insight to clients through the consolidation of client data and empowering decision making. We
seek to enhance transparency, providing better and consistent oversight over activities, deadlines and
regulatory changes. We seek to utilize automation to digitize client-facing processes and generate
efficiencies. We seek to provide control through managing risks and ensuring clients operate in a
compliant environment and with security of information. We seek to reap the benefits of new
technology—including regulatory technology (“RegTech”), client onboarding, robotic process
automation and blockchain—in a changing market and regulatory landscape.

Key Intertrust initiatives currently in development include the creation and deployment of a client
and payment portal, a virtual boardroom solution and self-service reporting solutions. These will enable
us to continue to develop as a technology enabled corporate and fund solutions provider.

**_Develop and maintain a dynamic and engaged global talent pool_**

We believe that the knowledge, local expertise and business relationships of our employees are
crucial to delivering high-quality services to our clients and generating new sustainable business. We
intend to continue to focus on attracting, developing and retaining the best talent in our industry. Our
talent strategy is centered on strong teams, platforms for growth and our values-driven culture.
Purpose-led and values-driven teams increase employee engagement, reinforce our strong brand and
positioning in the market and improve performance. To train our employees, we have developed
several platforms for personal and professional growth, such as the Global Mobility Program (in which
we seek to support the international mobility of our staff with a view to further developing the skillsets of
our employees and further increasing cooperation, knowledge sharing and cross-selling across our
global network), the Global Intertrust Academy (in which we train and educate our employees on
technical skills, as well as leadership, business development and relationship management skills),
“One Journey” (a program which aims to develop a positive workplace culture and environment as well
as an “Intertrust way” of working) and our Talent Program (a global talent development program which
offers a range of classes and assignments to develop leadership within the global business
environment).

**_Enable our strategic ambitions through best practice execution, including maintaining industry-_**
**_leading standards on compliance and risk management_**

To best execute our strategy, we adopt best practices including: global process standardization;
the creation of centers of excellence; and the outsourcing of certain business processes to nearby
countries to improve our customer service. The implementation of these strategies is underway and is
expected to support and enhance our Adjusted EBITDA margin and cash generation profile over the
medium term.

We believe that we are recognized by our clients and the business partners who refer new
business opportunities to us as having industry-leading standards on compliance and risk
management. We further believe that our strong relationships and ongoing dialogue with regulators to
discuss new legislative and regulatory developments and to promote best practice standards in relation
to compliance is expected to further improve the quality of our sector. We have four independent risk
monitoring functions: compliance and risk management; legal; tax; and internal audit. Our Compliance
and Risk Management team had approximately 55 FTEs as of September 30, 2018, including HQ and
local teams, and is responsible for developing and monitoring our compliance and risk management
processes and adherence to compliance and risk management standards and procedures. Our Internal
Audit team had two FTEs as of September 30, 2018 at HQ, and our Tax and Legal teams had three
and four FTEs at HQ as of September 30, 2018, respectively, not including local office teams. We
intend to maintain our high standards on compliance and continue to invest in our risk management
functions in order to support further sustainable growth of our business. To this effect, our Supervisory
Board is assisted by its Audit and Risk Committee, which is responsible for ensuring the proper
supervision on our compliance, risk management and audit functions. We believe that our clients value
our services and select us as their preferred expert administrative services provider in part because of
the high standards that we have consistently applied throughout our global network. This has made us
a reliable partner to whom clients can outsource certain of their activities on a global basis and in a
responsible manner.

We offer a comprehensive and integrated set of expert administrative services across Europe, the

tax filings based on advice of external experts and input from our clients. Except for certain limited local
tax advisory services that we provide to certain Private Wealth clients in Guernsey, we do not provide

for the referral of new business opportunities.

draft and submit all the relevant reports for several reporting regimes such as the US Foreign Account

**_Business Development_**

We recently created a global client solutions team to further accelerate our services and product
development as we aim to adapt to the changing needs of our clients. Next to the development of new
regulatory and non-regulatory services and solutions which add value for our clients, this team
enhances our existing services, and looks to expand our existing services globally. The global client
solutions team is based in our headquarters in Europe and serves all segments and service lines
globally.

In addition, we added specialized sales capabilities to our teams in the UK and the US in order to
improve our business development efforts in these regions. With a more complete service offering we
are able to target increased levels of cross-sell revenue from other service lines, and increased
revenue from clients and entities with more complex service requirements and substance.

We also have a marketing team with marketing specialists for each of our service lines and
experts in digital marketing, public relations, marketing content and events. Our marketing team
focuses on increasing and building brand awareness to enhance our market position.

**_Geographic Coverage_**

As of September 30, 2018, we provided our services from 41 offices in 29 jurisdictions across
Europe, the Americas, the Asia Pacific region and the Middle East. In addition to our global network of
offices, as of September 30, 2018, we had relationships with third parties in 144 other jurisdictions,
allowing us to assist our clients with their global expert administrative services needs by referring them
to these operating partners in jurisdictions where we do not have an operational presence. The
following map provides an overview of our global network of offices as of September 30, 2018:

**_The Netherlands_**

_Overview_

The Netherlands has maintained a longstanding tradition of political and social stability as well as
sophisticated legislation and a highly reputable and consistent fiscal system. The Netherlands benefits
from attractive corporate tax legislation, and remains a popular jurisdiction in Europe to establish a
corporate base for international operations, international group structures and for structuring complex
international transactions. The Netherlands has an extensive network of bilateral double tax treaties
(see also “Risk Factors—Certain prospective amendments to double tax treaties may have an adverse
_effect on our business.”), liberal foreign exchange regulations and flexible incorporation procedures for_
Dutch legal entities, making the Netherlands an attractive base for domiciling international business
operations. All trust, corporate and fund services activities are subject to supervision by the Dutch
Central Bank (“DNB”). Moreover, increasingly strict regulation by the DNB, demand for transparency
by regulators and increased compliance costs for trust, corporate and fund services providers have
contributed to further consolidation in the industry, a trend which is expected to continue.

In 2017, we were the leading provider of expert administrative services in the Netherlands with an
estimated market share of approximately 31% based on revenue for the year ended December 31,
2017. In the nine months ended September 30, 2018, the Netherlands accounted for 23.4% of our
revenue.

_Services and Clients_

We provide each of our four service lines in the Netherlands, however, our client base in the
Netherlands predominantly consists of Corporates service line clients. Compared to December 31,
2017, the number of client entities decreased by 6.5% from approximately 3,900 to approximately
3,700 as of September 30, 2018, mainly due to client entities reaching the end of their cycle and client
insourcing.

_Key Initiatives_

We have developed a number of initiatives aimed at facilitating the further growth of our business
in the Netherlands. We intend to increase the number of clients that we provide our services to through
a direct sales approach, through our network of business partners who refer business opportunities to
us and by encouraging cross-selling efforts between the entities in our organization. We aim to sell
additional value-added services to our existing clients with a view to increasing the revenue per client
entity that we service in the Netherlands. We intend to continue to invest in our employees with a view
to maintaining our position as an employer of choice in the expert administrative services industry. One
of the examples to attract young and highly educated talent in the Netherlands was the launch of the
“One Journey” program, which aims to develop a positive workplace culture and environment as well
as an “Intertrust way” of working, and a new career website.

In addition, we are working to further develop and rollout our integrated office solutions (“IOS”) to
provide clients with a permanent presence in the Netherlands with a comprehensive system, built
end-to-end, which can be easily integrated into their current business processes, supported with
complementary services.

**_Luxembourg_**

_Overview_

Luxembourg is an internationally recognized banking hub with a favorable regulatory environment
promoted by both the government and the private sector. It is considered to have a stable and
predictable banking and legislative environment with an educated work force and accommodates
policies toward foreign investments. Luxembourg has an extensive network of bilateral tax treaties,
investment protection treaties and a favorable tax regime (see also “Risk Factors—Certain prospective
_amendments to double tax treaties may have an adverse effect on our business.”). Luxembourg also_
actively promotes the fund industry while maintaining the highest standards in compliance. Local trust,
corporate and fund services activities are subject to supervision by the CSSF.

102


-----

In 2017, we were the second largest provider of expert administrative services in Luxembourg with
an estimated market share of approximately 11% based on revenue for the year ended December 31,
2017. In the nine months ended September 30, 2018, Luxembourg accounted for 22.0% of our
revenue.

_Services and Clients_

We provide each of our four service lines in Luxembourg, however, our client base in Luxembourg
predominantly consists of Funds service line clients. Compared to December 31, 2017, the number of
client entities decreased by 2.5% to approximately 2,800 as of September 30, 2018, mainly due to
client entities reaching the end of their cycle.

_Key Initiatives_

We have developed a number of initiatives aimed at facilitating the further growth of our business
in Luxembourg. We continually look for opportunities to diversify our service offering to enable our
clients to navigate successfully through the ever-changing regulatory landscape. An example of a
regulatory change is the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive. This led to additional reporting
requirements and more work is now required to keep our clients’ entities in good standing by, for
example, supporting clients with mandatory ultimate beneficial owner registrations. In addition,
legislative changes enabled us to expand our service offering in Luxembourg and helped us to obtain a
license from Luxembourg’s regulator CSSF to provide AIFM ManCo services.

**_The Americas_**

_Overview_

The Americas consists primarily of our business in the US, Curacao and the Cayman Islands. In
the nine months ended September 30, 2018, the Americas accounted for 16.8% of our revenue. In the
Cayman Islands, which accounts for the majority of our Americas segment, we were the second largest
provider of expert administrative services in 2017, with an estimated market share of approximately
18% based on revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Curacao expert administrative
services market mainly services Private Wealth clients and small and medium size Corporates clients,
with a total market size of approximately €140 million.

_Services and Clients_

From our offices in the Bahamas, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Curacao and
Delaware, we provide a full range of services to international corporate clients, funds and private
clients. Our other US offices and our offices in Brazil and Canada are representative offices serving as
a first point of contact for clients that have their headquarters or regional headquarters in these
jurisdictions. Compared to December 31, 2017, the number of client entities decreased by 4.1% from
approximately 27,700 to approximately 26,500 as of September 30, 2018, mainly due to client entities
reaching the end of their cycle and a number of competitive losses in the Cayman Islands, as well as
administrative clean-ups in the Cayman Islands.

_Key Initiatives_

We recently added specialized sales capabilities to our teams in the US in order to improve our
business development efforts. As part of our strategic ambitions, we are also growing our presence in
the Americas by expanding our existing services offering to include fund and capital markets
administration services as well as, subject to the approval of the relevant regulator, domestic trustee
and directorship services. We are extending our operating capabilities in Delaware and expect that this
will enable us to provide onshore services to US and international clients operating in every state of the
US.

103


-----

**_Jersey_**

_Overview_

Jersey is a well-established international finance center offering reliability, political and economic
stability and a sophisticated and comprehensive legal system. According to the OECD, Jersey is one of
the best regulated international financial centers. Jersey’s highly skilled and experienced financial
services providers, combined with a world class infrastructure makes it a popular and attractive
jurisdiction for trusts and foundations, as well as for private equity and real estate funds. Jersey has a
flat standard income tax rate for Jersey residents and no capital gains, inheritance, wealth or sales
taxes.

With the acquisition of Elian in 2016, we gained a presence in the Jersey market, particularly in the
capital markets and the private equity and real estate fund administration service lines. See
“Summary—History.” In 2017, our estimated market share in Jersey in the expert administrative
services market was approximately 10% based on revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017,
which made us the largest expert administrative services provider in Jersey. In the nine months ended
September 30, 2018, Jersey accounted for 11.9% of our revenue.

_Services and Clients_

We provide a broad range of services in Jersey, consisting of our Corporates, Funds and Private
Wealth service lines. Our client base in Jersey consists of alternative investment funds, financial
institutions, corporate and private clients. Compared to December 31, 2017, the number of client
entities decreased by 13.9% from approximately 4,300 to approximately 3,700 as of September 30,
2018. This decline was mainly due to the impact of an administrative clean-up in the first half of 2018
(now completed), and also a large client choosing to insource in the second quarter of 2018.

_Key Initiatives_

We aim to maintain our leading market position in Jersey by continuing to invest in our
foundations, specifically our people, and completing the Elian IT integration on schedule. We also
continue to pursue growth opportunities, especially within our Funds service line but also for
specialized services such as performance & reward management, treasury and investment services,
and listing services. In September 2018, we broadened our capabilities in our Capital Markets service
line in Jersey by becoming a Category 1 debt-listing member of The International Stock Exchange, a
service that will be offered across our global network of offices.

On September 23, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Elian. See “Summary—History.” The
integration of Elian in our Jersey business is progressing as planned and is expected to be completed
by mid-2019. We completed merging Elian’s offices with our offices in January 2017 and the related
revenue and cost synergies are on track to be realized within the planned time frame.

**_Rest of the World_**

Our offices in our Rest of the World segment encompass our operational and representative
offices in Europe (which are not otherwise captured and separately reported on), the Asia Pacific
region and the Middle East. As of 2017, Guernsey became part of the Rest of the World segment.

As of September 30, 2018, in the Rest of the World segment, we had leading market positions in
most of our key jurisdictions. In Asia we have strong positions in Singapore and Hong Kong. In Europe
we are the leading provider in Guernsey and we are well positioned in the Nordic countries, Ireland,
Spain and the UK. In the nine months ended September 30, 2018, the Rest of the World segment
(including Guernsey) accounted for 25.9% of our revenue.

_Europe_

In addition to our offices in the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Jersey, we have offices in each of
the major European jurisdictions, including Brussels, Copenhagen, Dublin, Frankfurt, Geneva, Istanbul,
Limassol, London, Madrid, Malmö, Stockholm, St. Peter Port, Zug, Zurich, Oslo and Helsinki.

104


-----

_Asia Pacific_

Our Asia Pacific offices are located in Beijing, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Singapore,
Sydney and Tokyo. Our offices located in China mainly assist our international clients in establishing
their businesses in the Chinese market and our Chinese clients in establishing their businesses
overseas. Our Hong Kong office works closely with our Chinese offices and has a substantial inbound
Chinese client base, but also offers Corporates and Private Wealth services to clients in mainland
China. Our office in Singapore mainly offers expert administrative services to inbound Singapore
clients, either to establish themselves in the Singapore market or to maintain and strengthen their
business in this region. In Japan we operate a sales office only.

_The Middle East_

We also have a Middle East office located in Dubai and have recently opened our second Middle
East office in the United Arab Emirates located in Abu Dhabi.

_Key Initiatives_

In February 2017 we acquired the remaining 25% stake in SFM Spain together with the affiliated
professional services activities of Azcona, a Spanish provider of corporate, funds and capital markets
services, to further grow and improve our Corporates, Funds and Capital Markets service lines in
Spain. See “Summary—History.”

During 2017, we closed our offices in Portugal and in Bahrain.

In July 2018 we expanded into Australia through the acquisition of Seed Outsourcing, a boutique
Australian corporate and fund services firm, providing corporate secretarial, director, domiciliation and
payroll services to private equity and real estate fund managers. See “Summary—History.” We have
been working with Seed Outsourcing for more than five years, enabling our global clients to grow their
business in Australia and New Zealand. The Seed Outsourcing team, led by founder Stephen Tamas,
will now be integrated and work closely with our other offices going forward.

In August 2018, we were granted a Trust or Company Service Provider (“TCSP”) license in Hong
Kong under the new TCSP regime, which requires companies providing trust or corporate services in
Hong Kong to be licensed by the Registrar of Companies and comply with the requirements of the AML
regulation.

We recently added specialized sales capabilities to our teams in the United Kingdom in order to
improve our business development efforts. In addition, we created a global client solutions team to
further accelerate our services and product development as we aim to adapt to the changing needs of
our clients.

**CLIENTS, CLIENT ENTITIES AND CLIENT SERVICE CONTRACTS**

**_Clients_**


We have a large and diversified client portfolio consisting of multinational companies, financial
institutions, alternative investment funds, entrepreneurs and high net worth individuals. We group our
clients in the following categories: Corporates clients; Funds clients; Capital Markets clients; and

We focus on delivering the highest quality, tailored services to our clients with a view to building
long-term relationships with our clients. We believe that client retention is primarily driven by the quality
of our services, the personal relationships we build with our clients, our comprehensive expert
administrative services offering, our global network and our expertise, reliability and responsiveness.
We believe that clients, in particular multinational companies, increasingly prefer to work with a global
service provider that offers an integrated and comprehensive set of expert administrative services.

According to market research carried out by a third-party in 2017 among clients and business
partners, our net promoter score (“NPS”) was 23%, slightly lower than the NPS in 2016 of 25%, but
well above the “Finance B2B” benchmark average of 14%. NPS is a client loyalty metric that is used to
measure the loyalty of a firm’s client relationships. An NPS can range from -100% to +100%.
Respondents are asked to rate the likelihood that they would recommend a company on a zero to ten
scale. An NPS that is positive is perceived to be favorable. Our NPS outperforms our key international
and local competitors which we believe distinguishes us from them.

**_Client Entities_**

As of September 30, 2018 we administered approximately 48,300 client entities on behalf of more
than 16,000 clients. As of September 30, 2018, approximately 3,700 of the client entities we
administered were established in the Netherlands, approximately 2,800 in Luxembourg, approximately
26,500 in the Americas, approximately 3,700 in Jersey and approximately 11,600 in the Rest of the
World.

The following table sets out information relating to the client entities serviced per geographical
segment as of September 30, 2018:

**September 30, 2018[(1)]**

**Number of Entities** **% of Total Entities**
**(in thousands)**
The Netherlands . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3.7 7.6%

(1) Information is based on management’s estimates.
(2) Average Revenue Per Entity is defined as our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 divided by the
number of client entities as of September 30, 2018.

During the lifecycle of a client entity, we provide services relating to the incorporation, ongoing
maintenance, compliance with applicable laws and regulations and liquidation of the entity. We
consider these services to be non-discretionary since our clients require these services irrespective of
a client’s financial or operational performance. The remaining services we offer are what we consider
discretionary services, namely those services that are specific to the occurrence of a certain event or to
a request from a client during the lifetime of a client entity, including services in connection with
restructurings, mergers and other transactions.

We estimate that approximately 90% of our total revenue is generated by on-going compliance
and maintenance services of client entities which for the most part can be considered as recurring. The
remaining 10% relates to non-recurring revenue such as revenue generated by incorporations and
liquidations.

**_Client Service Contracts_**

When entering into a new engagement with a client, we enter into a client service contract which is
based on our standard template client service contract. Our client service contracts generally include
an indemnity given by the client pursuant to which the client indemnifies us against any damages that
we incur in connection with the services that we render for the client, except for damages which are the
result of our fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct. Our client service contracts are generally
entered into for an indefinite period of time and may be terminated upon relatively short notice. Material
deviations from our standard template client service contract must be approved by our in-house legal
department. We provide our services on an hourly rate basis or on a fixed fee basis, or a combination
of both. If we provide our services on an hourly rate basis, our fees are calculated based on the time
spent and direct expenses that are incurred. When we agree with a client to provide services on a fixed
fee basis, we agree on a scope of work for the services to be provided and arrange that any services
provided outside of the agreed scope of work will be invoiced separately or on an hourly rate basis.

**INTERNAL ORGANIZATION AND RISK MANAGEMENT**

**_General_**

Our business is centrally managed by the Executive Committee consisting of 11 members. See
“Management.” Our centralized management organization enables us to initiate and roll-out sales,
marketing, HR, finance, legal, compliance and risk management, internal audit, strategic and other
initiatives in an integrated and coordinated manner throughout our global network and promote that our
organization works together as “One Intertrust, One Team.” We believe that this centralized
management structure distinguishes us from most of our competitors who do not have the same
centralized and coordinated approach on a global basis.

We adopted the “three lines of defense model” that outlines the relationships and responsibilities
of the business, compliance and risk management, and internal audit functions.

First line of defense: Business

Our business teams bear primary responsibility for identifying, controlling and monitoring the risks
within their processes, maintaining effective internal control frameworks and adhering to global
compliance policies and standards.

Second line of defense: Compliance and Risk Management

The Compliance and Risk Management team is globally responsible for coordinating, developing
and monitoring our risk management processes and adherence to compliance standards and
procedures. The Compliance and Risk Management team is responsible for providing the independent
risk reports to the Executive Committee, our Supervisory Board and our Audit and Risk Committee.
The Compliance and Risk Management team also monitors changes that may impact the risk profile of
the business and whether it is appropriate to provide new services to existing clients. The Compliance
and Risk Management team further ensures that employees in every office receive compliance
training, in addition to the mandatory Group-wide e-learning courses on AML and other relevant topics.

Third line of defense: Internal Audit

The independent Internal Audit team conducts audits that provide insights into how and to what
extent we control the risks that may jeopardize our strategic and other objectives. These audits provide
management with additional assurance on the effectiveness of internal controls and risk management.

**_Legal_**

As of September 30, 2018, our in-house legal department consisted of four FTEs at HQ (not
including local teams) headed by our General Counsel who reports to our CEO. We operate in a
regulated and litigation sensitive environment. We acknowledge the importance of managing our legal
risks and monitoring any legal proceedings and potential claims and mitigating any potential risks and
liabilities resulting from such legal proceedings and claims. In order to ensure that we control our legal
risks, we have implemented certain procedures and controls aimed at identifying, reporting and
monitoring the legal risks related to our operations. Our General Counsel is tasked with the observance
of these procedures and controls.

The General Counsel is also heading the General Data Protection Office and has appointed
employees responsible for GDPR or local Data Protection Officers in each jurisdiction, who together
oversee all privacy matters, data protection policies and reporting of the Group.

**_Compliance and Risk Management Function_**

Our compliance and risk management department is headed by our Global Head of Compliance
and Risk Management and consisted of 55 FTEs, including HQ and local teams, as of September 30,
2018. The Global Head of Compliance and Risk Management has the authority to issue binding
instructions and non-binding recommendations to the local compliance teams. Our Global Head of
Compliance and Risk Management reports to our CFO.

108


-----

On a local level, our offices in the Netherlands, Luxembourg, the Cayman Islands, Jersey,
Guernsey, British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, the UK, Curacao, the Bahamas, the Nordics, Spain,
Switzerland, Ireland, Singapore, Dubai, Belgium and China each have their own compliance officers.
The compliance officers of each local office assist our local management in identifying and assessing
potential compliance risks, providing guidance and training on compliance matters, and performing a
monitoring and reporting role. Local compliance managers and directors functionally report to a group
compliance director. Each local compliance director reports to the managing director of its local office.
Offices that do not have a compliance officer are assisted by a group compliance director who in turn
reports to the Global Head of Compliance and Risk Management.

We have a compliance manual which describes our compliance framework and details our risk
assessment and acceptance procedures and policies. Our compliance manual serves as a tool to
guide our employees when performing their tasks and responsibilities in the conduct of our day-to-day
business. In addition, we have a compliance charter which sets forth the principles, roles and
responsibilities of our compliance team in relation to our clients, client entities for which we provide
services, regulators and governmental authorities.

Like in any company, risk is inherent in the decisions that we take to manage and run our business
and in the business processes established to assist in the achievement of our business objectives.
Changes in the way we carry out our operations resulting from, for example, the expansion of our
business organically or through acquisitions or changes in the regulatory framework of our industry,
can place strain on our control mechanisms and become sources of risk. We have established
effective risk and control elements in our overall corporate governance framework to mitigate these
risks.

Our Management Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of our risk
management framework. Our risk management framework is based on the COSO Enterprise Risk
Management Framework provided by the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway
Commission. The framework identifies four risk categories: strategic; operational; reporting/finance;
and compliance. Periodic reporting with respect to the four risk categories takes place on the following
items:

    - reporting on certain pre-defined key risk indicators;

    - reporting on incidents; and

    - reporting on periodic risk self-assessments, which are performed annually.

Local offices prepare and discuss quarterly risk reports in local risk committees. These reports are
also submitted to our Global Head of Compliance and Risk Management who is responsible for
preparing a quarterly consolidated report for the Executive Committee and our Management Board.

**_Know Your Customer Controls_**

In order to comply with applicable KYC requirements we have a client acceptance policy in place,
containing procedures for the assessment of new clients and entities and the review of existing entities
as well as the beneficial owners and directors of such entities. We are required by law to assist in
detecting and preventing activities relating to money laundering, terrorist financing and fraud and
declare suspicious transactions to the local anti-money-laundering authorities. We are required to
verify the identity of our clients and their ultimate beneficial owners and perform diligence on the
source of funds used in transactions. In 2017, following the acquisition of Elian, we initiated the design
and testing of a new process for accepting clients using best practices from both Intertrust and Elian.
This unified process will be applied by the local offices. The aim is to have a more efficient process
resulting in more reliable data in our local ViewPoint or similar database (which is an IT solution for the
administration and management of business entities) and leading to more consistency creating the
possibility of more central oversight. The new process was tested in Luxembourg in the first quarter of
2018 and is currently being further rolled out with IT and workflow support.

An important part of our KYC policy and our risk assessment policy is to gain insight into the
business rationale of the entities and transactions that we service. Consequently, our risk assessment

109


-----

procedures are based on three pillars on which we gather information: (i) the ultimate beneficial owner
or client; (ii) the activities or purpose of the entities or client entity; and (iii) the services to be provided
by us. This risk assessment classifies the risk level of a client entity into high, medium or low risk.
Depending on the risk classification of the relevant client entity, the final decision on client acceptance
is made by the local acceptance committee or local management. Each office that has its own
compliance director has a local acceptance committee to carry out the acceptance procedures for highand medium-risk client entities. We consider client entities to be high-risk when the beneficial owner or
client is a higher risk politically exposed person or a resident of a high-risk jurisdiction, or when the
client or the client entity is engaged in certain high-risk types of business. In addition, a local
acceptance committee is involved in the acceptance process for medium-risk client entities, such as
certain real estate investments or entities with an independent board of directors. The acceptance
procedures for high- and medium-risk clients for offices that do not have their own local acceptance
committee are carried out by our acceptance committee for the Rest of the World. The client
acceptance procedure for low-risk client entities is carried out by local management. In addition, a
more rigid acceptance procedure is applied with respect to the acceptance of clients that are politically
exposed persons. Such acceptance procedure involves unanimous approval of the local managing
director, the local compliance director and the Head of Compliance.

Once accepted, client entities are reviewed on a recurring basis to ensure that the verification
documents are updated and the entity keeps complying with applicable laws, regulations and our own
rules and standards. Depending on the risk qualification, all files are submitted to a periodic review.

**_Internal Audit Function_**

As of September 30, 2018, our Internal Audit team consisted of two FTEs at HQ (not including
local teams) led by our Head of Internal Audit who reports to our CFO and the Audit and Risk
Committee of our Supervisory Board. Like in any company, risk is inherent in the decisions that we
take to manage and run our business and in the business processes established to assist in the
achievement of our business objectives. Changes in the way we carry out our operations resulting
from, for example, the expansion of our business organically or through acquisitions or changes in the
regulatory framework of our industry, can place strain on our control mechanisms and become sources
of risk. We have established effective risk and control elements in our overall corporate governance
framework to mitigate these risks.

**_Tax_**

As of September 30, 2018, we had one FTE at HQ, our Group Head of Tax, supported on an ad
_hoc basis by local tax compliance professionals. We recognize the importance of tax and tax_
compliance in a worldwide environment, which is evolving more and more rapidly and getting more and
more complex. In order to ensure that we are in control of our tax obligations and risks, we have
implemented a system of policies, procedures, processes and controls. As part thereof we have
adopted a tax risk manual, setting forth our procedures for the identification, mitigation, control and
reporting of tax risks related to all entities that form part of our Group. Our Group Head of Tax, who
reports to our CFO, is responsible for the observance of these policies, procedures, processes and
controls. Our tax risk manual is part of our corporate governance model, which provides guidance on
the management and the mitigation of risk across all areas of our business activity. In connection with
the identification, mitigation, control and reporting of tax risks, our risk manual sets forth the roles and
responsibilities for our tax department, as well as our finance department in those jurisdictions where
we do not have a dedicated tax department. These roles and responsibilities include setting our tax
policies, scoping and managing our tax risks, managing our tax basis and compliance requirements
and supporting our senior management in transactions and operational decisions.

**EMPLOYEES**

We believe that the quality of our employees is key to providing our clients with high-quality
services and building long-term relationships with our clients. We have a well-educated workforce,
evidenced by a high proportion of our employees having higher education degrees or qualifications. As
of September 30, 2018, our employees worked across 41 offices and 29 jurisdictions in Europe, the
Americas, Asia Pacific and the Middle East.

110


-----

Our employees include people trained as financial experts, lawyers, tax law professionals and
accountants. Our workforce is comprised of employees of over 87 different nationalities. We put a lot of
emphasis on talent development. To this effect, we have established our Global Intertrust Academy
that provides a variety of training and education programs covering technical training, leadership
development, business development and relationship management skills. Local faculties of the Global
Intertrust Academy provide specific training programs aligned with local development needs. Through
our Global Mobility Program, we seek to support the international mobility of our staff with a view to
further developing the skillsets of our employees and further increasing cooperation, knowledge
sharing and cross-selling across our global network. During 2017 and the nine months ended
September 30, 2018, approximately 4% of our employees have undertaken an international
assignment for a substantial period of time in one of the offices of our global network. We have a
structured, global performance management and talent development process in place that supports
our staff in maximizing their performance, achieve their ambitions and to prepare succession for our
key positions.

In 2017 we launched a new global program called “One Journey” which aims to develop a positive
workplace culture and environment as well as an “Intertrust way” of working. The program will have
sustained delivery over a period of two to three years and result in a culture which we believe will make
us an employer of choice. The launch of “One Journey” focused initially on the theme of building trust
within teams and across the organization by exploring core building blocks of listening, developing a
feedback culture and empowerment. To kick off the program we launched a global training initiative for
600 managers around the world to ensure they have the right skills to drive and embed our culture
within their teams. A series of activities were designed so that every employee across the globe takes
part in creating the workplace environment and culture they want to work in. At the same time, our aim
is to remain an efficient organization. For instance, we therefore launched a headcount alignment
program earlier this year, which involved around 60 employees and is aimed at maintaining efficiency
in relation to the management of our staff related costs.

As of September 30, 2018, we employed 2,532 FTEs worldwide. As of September 30, 2018,
approximately 75% of our employees were categorized as fee earning and assisted in the provision of
services to our clients. The table below shows the number of FTEs per geographical segment at the
dates indicated:

In 2017 we had 754 FTE joiners (excluding acquisitions) and 693 FTE leavers. Our 2017 annual
turnover was 28.1%, of which 23.5% was voluntary (meaning staff who resigned as opposed to leaving
for other reasons). The annual turnover for 2017 was higher than in previous years (25% in 2016 and
22% in 2015). As a result, we have accelerated our retention programs and increased our investment
in recruitment and hiring capabilities (predominantly in the Netherlands and Luxembourg).

During 2017 we analyzed the causes of increased staff turnover further. Following this analysis,
we undertook several initiatives to mitigate this:

    - local employer branding and recruitment drive increased competition in local and international
labor markets requires us to invest more time in local employer branding and recruitment
efforts. Various countries use graduate events and social media to increase access to talent
pools;

    - management skills training and global culture program increased demand for career
development opportunities, especially among younger workers, has led us to prioritize

111


-----

management skills training and to launch our global culture program which will empower our
managers to better guide the careers of their staff; and

    - we believe we can retain staff better by investing more time and effort in onboarding. Various
local initiatives were taken in 2017 to assist new recruits at the start of their Intertrust career
and global initiatives have been taken in 2018 to create minimum standards for onboarding
globally. For example, we are currently developing a global induction program that will ensure
whichever location a new employee joins, they have a consistently positive global experience,
designed to effectively induct them into our organization and allow them to become productive
and settled quickly.

As of September 30, 2018, we had 712 FTE joiners (excluding acquisitions) and 615 FTE leavers.
Our turnover for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was 23%, of which 18% was voluntary
(meaning staff who resigned as opposed to leaving for other reasons). The turnover for the nine
months ended September 30, 2018 was higher than for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.

We operate an annual target setting and appraisal cycle supported by clear guidelines for
performance indicators and a calibration process that is aimed at monitoring development in fixed and
variable pay, ensuring fairness and diversification among our employees. We recognize the importance
of a strong and cohesive corporate culture that is aligned with our strategy. To this effect, we have
defined four corporate values: responsiveness; innovation; collaboration; and excellence. Each
corporate value is paired with certain specific required behaviors which are measured as part of our
annual appraisal cycle. We have a performance based reward policy, “Pay for Performance,” aimed at
incentivizing our employees to participate in the success of our business. Performance is measured
both on behavioral targets, 40%, and quantitative KPI’s, 60%.

Our HR strategy is centered on increasing employee engagement. We believe that the ability of
our managers to speak with their teams about personal development and learning as well as to discuss
feedback, is vital in creating a highly engaged workforce. To assist them, we run our annual global
employee engagement survey and coordinate initiatives to follow up on these survey outcomes. During
this process, each team creates an action plan based on the team results while managing directors
create their own focusing on overall strengths and improvement for the office. The global results are
used as input for the development of our “One Journey” culture program.

We have started to standardize our worldwide recruitment processes in order to maximize the
effectiveness of our recruitment channels, including social networks and referrals. We have defined a
clear communication approach to ensure the consistent messaging of our value proposition towards
the labor market. In order to safeguard the quality of the people we hire and to safeguard our
reputation, we apply strict pre-employment screening measures and use assessment tools in our
selection process.

**CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY**

We are aware of our role as gatekeeper and a facilitator of legitimate international investment and
trade. We therefore make careful choices about the clients we work with and look to foster long-term
relationships with them based on trust and transparency. We interact with our business partners on the
same basis, to ensure our mutual clients’ needs are correctly met. To achieve these goals, we have
nurtured a culture and implemented corresponding systems and procedures across our organization
that are aligned to our values of partnership, people, commitment, integrity and quality. Directive
2013/34/EU also requires us to be increasingly transparent as a business. This directive covers issues
such as: our business model; environmental, social and personnel matters; human rights; corruption
and bribery prevention; and diversity among our leadership.

In addition, the revised corporate governance code puts more emphasis on the development and
implementation of a policy directed at long-term value creation and transparency. In 2018 we
formulated objectives and key performance indicators. In this way, we are able to show that we are
delivering on our goals.

112


-----

Our Corporate Social Responsibility program sets out a global approach to sustainability. It guides
our actions by focusing on three key areas: Business ethics & compliance; People, culture &
environment; and Intertrust Foundation (community).

    - Business ethics & compliance

We recognize that by assisting reputable companies, financial institutions, funds and private
individuals to comply with their legal, financial and regulatory reporting obligations we are creating
conditions for the sound, transparent and lawful conduct of international trade and investment. Making
choices about who we serve and how we serve them is an important part of this process. We therefore
consider compliance and integrity within a stringent regulatory environment to be an integral part of our
business identity.

    - People, culture & environment

We endeavor to be the employer of choice in our sector and are committed to partnership and
integrity in the workplace. We make substantial investments to ensure a sustainable growth path by
fostering a healthy company culture and by developing our employees.

    - Intertrust Foundation (community)

Our Corporate Social Responsibility program also consists of the Intertrust Foundation. The
Intertrust Foundation has been established to support employee-led initiatives for the benefit of certain
youth and education programs. The Intertrust Foundation has Intertrust ambassadors in each office
that engage our staff in corporate giving. The Intertrust Foundation has developed and is maintaining
an Early Childhood and Development Centre in Gambia, in partnership with Child Fund International.
Our leadership development also focuses on corporate social responsibility and two leadership trips for
our senior managers have been organized to Gambia. In 2017, the Intertrust Foundation initiated a
new multi-year global project to mark our 65th anniversary. We announced a three year global
partnership with SOS Children’s Villages. The new corporate social responsibility charity partner was
chosen by employees.

**INSURANCE**

We maintain a comprehensive insurance program for our businesses and operations. Our
insurance program includes a combined directors’ and officers’ and professional indemnity insurance
(including outside directorship liability), comprehensive crime, electronic and computer insurance, and
general liability insurance. Our professional indemnity insurance provides coverage against claims
arising in connection with services provided by our employees on our behalf, including services
provided by our employees as directors of client entities. Pursuant to our standard employment
agreements, we typically indemnify our employees for damages arising out of claims made by third
parties in connection with the services that our employees provide in good faith to our clients on our
behalf, except in the event of gross negligence or willful misconduct. We believe that we maintain
insurance coverage in a manner consistent with customary practices in our industry. We cannot
guarantee, however, that we will not incur any losses or be the subject of any claims that exceed the
scope of the relevant insurance coverage. We continue to re-assess at each renewal the possibility to
optimize our insurance structure taking into account both insurance market conditions and the
expansion of our business.

We provide directors’ and officers’ liability insurance for all members of our Management Board,
our Supervisory Board and the Executive Committee, as well as certain other persons within our
Group.

**INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY**

We believe that a number of capabilities allowing us to differentiate our proposition from those of
our competitors are enabled by our IT systems. Although we create value through people driven
services, IT and technological innovation plays a key role in optimizing our service levels and

113


-----

increasing the interaction and retention of clients. At the same time we use our IT systems to improve
collaboration and achieve efficiency gains. Our IT systems enable effective data processing and the
protection of our clients’ sensitive and confidential information. We mitigate the inherent risks to the
usage of IT systems and the processing and storage of data by network security measures, business
continuity planning, controls, planning and monitoring. For the period 2015 to 2021, our IT cost is
expected to be on average 7.1% of our revenue, which would exceed the expected industry average IT
cost of 4.7% of revenue over the same period. Over the same period, IT cost as a percentage of
revenue in the industry is expected to vary between 2.0% in the lower quartile and 6.0% in the upper
quartile, so our IT cost is expected to also exceed the upper quartile in the industry. This IT investment
ahead of our peers has allowed us to develop the technology foundations of a digitally enabled firm.

Because of the importance of IT for our business, we have set out an IT roadmap (“IT Roadmap”)
pursuant to which we plan to continue to invest in innovation and technology with specific focus on the
improvement of our global IT infrastructure and on the development of a solid and robust technology
foundation to give our clients insight, transparency and controls of their data though portal technology.
With regards to our IT infrastructure developments, we are focusing on a migration strategy to cloud
infrastructures and services (IaaS, SaaS and PaaS) which is expected to enable us to ensure flexibility,
scalability and continuation of critical IT services in the event of a disaster.

Furthermore, our IT Roadmap includes the implementation of a new reliable and easily scalable
workspace hybrid solution consisting of local application installations and virtualization which is
expected to be supported by a completely new network infrastructure. Full IT integration of recent
mergers and acquisitions is also in our agenda, which is expected to benefit us by strengthening
relationship with our clients and consolidating our IT infrastructure. We are in the process of
implementing our IT Roadmap in our various geographical segments, and implementation of certain
aspects of the IT Roadmap is already completed in the Netherlands, Luxembourg and the Rest of the
World. We estimate that the IT Roadmap will be fully implemented by the end of 2019.

From a security perspective, we fully recognize the importance of maintaining a comprehensive
information security program to protect confidential information in an integrated financial services
environment. IT security is embedded in our information security policy and framework. The security
policies are deeply integrated within all IT activities in our IT department. In addition, information
security is not just an IT matter but is discussed globally between various functions, including audit,
risk, compliance and legal, and there is regular communication with local management and local IT on
security matters.

**INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY**

We are the owner of several trademarks, trade names and logos worldwide, including several
trademarks for Intertrust and ATC, a provider of expert administrative services in various jurisdictions,
based and registered in Luxembourg. We believe that our core intellectual property rights are
adequately protected. Trademarks for the words and the word-and-picture combinations used by our
Group companies have been registered, or are in the process of registration, in the countries in which
they are located.

**LEGAL AND ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS**

As a provider of expert administrative services, we operate in a litigation sensitive environment
and the amounts of damages claimed from us can be material. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to
_our Business and Industry—As a provider of expert administrative services, we operate in a litigation_
_sensitive environment and are susceptible to litigation and claims.” We are involved in a number of_
legal proceedings that have arisen in the ordinary course of our business. Other than as discussed
below, we believe that there are no material legal, arbitration or governmental proceedings in which we
are involved and which are currently pending or with which we have been threatened that may have a
material adverse effect on our financial position or profitability. We intend to continue to defend the
matters discussed below vigorously and although we believe that we have good arguments to defend
ourselves against these claims, the outcome of legal proceedings can be extremely difficult to predict
with certainty and we can offer no assurances as to the outcome. We maintain professional indemnity

insurance and outside directors’ and officers’ insurance to protect ourselves against legal claims. Our
professional indemnity insurance provides coverage against claims arising in connection with services
provided by our employees on our behalf, including services provided by our employees as directors of
client entities. See “—Insurance.” Where appropriate, we record a provision for legal and arbitration
proceedings when there is a sufficient probability that a dispute or claim will result in a loss and the
amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated.

**_Legal Proceedings_**

In September 2012, a former managing director of a client entity involved two of our subsidiaries in
Luxembourg in their respective capacities as former domiciliation agent and former supervisory auditor
of the client entity in legal proceedings before the courts of Luxembourg relating to the bankruptcy of
the client entity. Initially, the claimant sought damages in an amount of €33.8 million, alleging failure by
the first subsidiary to forward the initial summons to court regarding the bankruptcy proceedings of the
client entity in a timely fashion, as a result of which it is claimed that the client entity was prevented
from taking action to avoid its bankruptcy. The claim further alleges that the subsidiary failed to prepare
the annual accounts and failed to convene the shareholders’ meetings of the client entity appropriately.
A second subsidiary was joined to the proceedings in its capacity as former supervisory auditor of the
client entity. In March 2014, the court of first instance dismissed all claims against our subsidiaries. In
March 2018, the Luxembourg court of appeal confirmed the first judgment and dismissed the claims
against one of our subsidiaries. The claimant may still file an appeal with the Luxembourg Supreme
Court. Furthermore, there is one remaining claim against one of the subsidiaries, however, the
Luxembourg court of appeal stayed the case until such subsidiary regularizes its legal representation.
We have notified our insurance company and believe that the claim is covered by our professional
indemnity insurance.

In August 2005, one of the shareholders of a client entity initiated legal proceedings before the
courts of Switzerland against one of our subsidiaries in Switzerland which provided corporate director
services to the client entity. The claimant demanded the return of 50% of the shares in the client entity
to which he claimed to be entitled. In June 2012, the courts of Switzerland ruled that the relevant
shares in the client entity had been wrongfully transferred and that the shares had to be transferred
back to the claimant. The shares were subsequently transferred back. In June 2013, the claimant filed
a preliminary claim before the courts of Switzerland, seeking compensation for damages in an amount
of CHF 133.4 million. The claim alleged that our subsidiary, in its capacity as (former) director of the
client entity, facilitated the aforementioned transfer of shares. In November 2013, the court granted the
claimant three months to initiate formal legal proceedings, but no formal claim was filed. In January
2014, the claimant filed a second preliminary claim before the courts of Switzerland for a total amount
of CHF 62.3 million in relation to the aforementioned transfer of shares. In April 2014, the court granted
the claimant a further three months to initiate formal legal proceedings against our subsidiary. No legal
proceedings have been initiated since. The claimant could, however, start legal proceedings against
our subsidiary in the future. We believe that under the share purchase agreement with respect to the
acquisition of our Group by Waterland Private Equity Investments in January 2010, our former
shareholders are obliged to indemnify us for any liability arising out of this claim, although this
indemnity is being contested by these former shareholders.

In June 2013, certain pension funds brought suit in the United States District Court in the Middle
District of Louisiana against a number of parties, including one of our former employees who had
provided director services to one of the funds, alleging, among other things, violation of the Louisiana
Securities Act, breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation and unfair trade practices. The plaintiffs
are seeking damages for lost investments in the amount of $100 million. Our former employee is one of
many defendants in these proceedings and performed only a minor role with respect to the relevant
funds. Consequently, we believe that the quantum of the claim bears no direct relation to any alleged
culpability of our former employee. Our former employee has not been served with a formal claim. We
have notified our insurance company and believe that the claim is covered by our professional
indemnity insurance.

In August 2014, a publishing and communication company in Spain instituted legal proceedings
before the Luxembourg courts against, among others, one of our client entities, two of our employees

115


-----

in Luxembourg (in their capacity as directors of that client entity) and a former employee of one of our
subsidiaries in Luxembourg, who acted as a director of that client entity in the past. The claimant, a
minority shareholder of the client entity, is seeking cancellation of a transaction regarding the transfer
of shares that the client entity held in a Spanish company to a newly incorporated Dutch company in
return for shares in that Dutch company. The claim is based on an alleged failure of the client entity’s
board of directors to comply with its articles of association and to convene an extraordinary general
meeting of shareholders in order to approve the relevant transaction prior to implementation. The
claimant alleges that, as a result of this transaction, its investment in the assets held through the client
entity has reduced in value and claims an amount of approximately €10 million in damages in case the
transaction cannot be annulled. We believe that the underlying matter is primarily a dispute between
the relevant shareholders of the client entity. We have notified our insurance company and believe that
the claim is covered by our professional indemnity insurance.

Since February 2015, one of our subsidiaries in the British Virgin Islands has received a number of
notices from lenders under loan agreements entered into between such lenders and such subsidiary,
acting in its capacity as trustee of a trust, as borrower. There are approximately 220 loan agreements
concluded under the laws of Hong Kong with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of
approximately $27.7 million. The loan proceeds received by the borrower/trustee were used to invest
for the benefit of the trust in two funds managed by a third-party investment manager of the trust and of
the two funds. As of June 2015, the trust had cash of approximately $1.9 million and the investments in
the two funds had an estimated net value of approximately $1.5 million. The lenders’ notices request
full repayment of their loans and interest. The loan agreements provide that the borrower’s liabilities
under the loan agreements shall only be settled out of the borrower’s claim to indemnity from the trust
and the amount the borrower may receive from the undertaking provided by the trust’s unit holder (i.e.,
the beneficiary of the trust which is in turn beneficially owned by the same natural person as the trust’s
investment manager) to repay the loan and interest in the event the borrower is unable to repay the
same from the funds of the trust. Some lenders’ notices have commented on the unusual structure of
the trust and included allegations against our subsidiary, including allegations of misrepresentations,
breaches of trust, failure to supervise the investment manager, failure to notify the lenders on a timely
basis of losses incurred by the trust, and wrongful assistance to the investment manager and the unit
holder in issuing and selling the loan agreements. No legal proceedings have been initiated against our
subsidiary. We have notified our insurance company of the matter and believe that any claim that may
arise from the matter should be covered by our professional indemnity insurance.

In November 2013, a beneficiary of a client entity established in Curacao filed a claim before the
courts of Curacao against both the client entity and one of our subsidiaries in Liechtenstein which
provided corporate director services to the client entity. The other beneficiary of the entity joined the
proceedings, also filing a claim against the client entity and our subsidiary. The claims relate to past
and future distributions made and to be made out of the client entity and other entities managed by our
subsidiary to the beneficiaries and related entities. Both beneficiaries claim to be prejudiced and have
requested the court to order our subsidiary to render account, while requests for declaratory judgments
holding our subsidiary liable for an unspecified amount of damages have been commenced as well.
The claims are based on allegations that our subsidiary breached its fiduciary duties by authorizing or
failing to prevent certain unequal distributions made to the beneficiaries, for not providing required
information and for treating the beneficiaries unequally. In July 2015, one of the beneficiaries filed
another claim before the courts of Curacao and requested the reopening of proceedings that the
relevant beneficiary started in 2000 before the courts of Curacao which resulted in a final judgment in
2007 (the “2000 Legal Proceedings”). In the 2000 Legal Proceedings, the beneficiary requested,
among other things, a declaratory judgment that the assets of the foundation formed part of the
inheritance of the beneficiary’s testator and claimed that the client entity and our subsidiary be jointly
and severally held liable to transfer the assets of the foundation to the legal heirs of the beneficiary’s
testator. Such claims were dismissed in 2007 as the beneficiary was unable to prove that the testator
deposited funds in the foundation. Since then, a French court established that according to French law
the capital of the foundation forms part of the testator’s inheritance and information in relation to the
foundation was made available to the beneficiaries. The relevant beneficiary saw cause for reopening
the 2000 Legal Proceedings and the revocation of the judgments rendered therein. The request for
reopening has lead the beneficiary to request the Court to stay the proceedings started in November
2013 until a final decision has been rendered upon the claims in the revocation proceedings. In

116


-----

September 2017, the Court in Curacao ordered that the 2000 Legal Proceedings should be reopened.
The other legal proceedings in Curacao are stayed. In 2016, the beneficiary initiated legal proceedings
in Paris against the other beneficiary in order to have the inheritance reopened as it is alleged that
assets would have been concealed. Two of our subsidiaries, together with the client entity, were
summoned to intervene in these legal proceedings in May 2017. The Paris court has decided to stay
the legal proceedings until decision in the Curacao legal proceedings is rendered. We have reasonable
grounds to believe that under the share purchase agreement with respect to the acquisition of our
Group by Waterland Private Equity Investments in January 2010, our former shareholders are obliged
to indemnify us for any liability arising out of the claim related to the reopening.

In June 2015, a client company initiated legal proceedings in Luxembourg against the trustee of
two trusts, in relation to two share and purchase agreements that were signed between the client
company, as seller, and the trustee of two trusts, as buyers, whereby the client company was
represented by its managing director, one of our former employees. The client company is contesting
the validity of the share and purchase agreements and is therefore requesting the annulment or
alternatively damages from the buyers in the amount of €10 million. One of the buyers has summoned,
among others, our former employee, in March 2016 to be fully indemnified for any adverse judgment
rendered against it and is also claiming an amount of €1 million as compensation for moral prejudice.
We have notified our insurance company and believe that the claim is covered by our professional
indemnity insurance.

In October 2018, a Dutch law firm filed a report at the Dutch Public Prosecution Office on behalf of
an international campaign organization. The report is targeted at a number of entities that are alleged
to be involved in money laundering activities. A company acquired by Intertrust in 2013 provided
services to some of these entities from 2007 to 2008. Neither we nor any of our affiliates have had any
dealings with these entities since 2008. While we do not believe that there has been any wrongdoing
by us (including any member of the Group) in connection with this matter, we are continuing to monitor
further developments.

**_Tax Matters_**

In 2015, the Belgian tax authorities delivered a notice to the third-party liquidator of one of our
former subsidiaries for tax and penalties in the amount of approximately €16.4 million (to be increased
with a late payment interest accruing as of May 1, 2012) in connection with Belgian dividend
withholding tax over the payment of liquidation proceeds to a Swiss holding company in connection
with the liquidation of the former subsidiary in 2012. No withholding tax was paid over the liquidation
proceeds based on the EU/Switzerland agreement dated October 26, 2004 providing for measures
equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive 2003/48/EC on taxation of savings income in the
form of interest payments. The application of the exemption under this agreement has been challenged
by the Belgian tax authorities on technical grounds. Formal tax complaints were filed as we believed
we had good grounds to challenge the tax assessment and obtain either a full release or a
considerable reduction of the tax amount and annulment of the penalties imposed. In 2017, the Belgian
tax authorities delivered a formal decision containing a partial rescission of the imposed tax, and
cancellation of the imposed penalties. The remaining assessment amounts to €9.8 million (to be
increased with a late payment interest accruing as of May 1, 2012). The case was submitted to the
relevant court in 2017 and the court procedure is ongoing. The outcome of the administrative
proceedings or any appeal proceedings before the courts remains uncertain.

**REGULATION**

**GENERAL**

Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory oversight. Applicable rules and regulations
require us to obtain licenses to perform certain of our business activities. In certain jurisdictions, we are
subject to prudential supervision and certain business conduct requirements, such as minimum capital,
solvency and liquidity requirements. In other jurisdictions without such requirements, we are
supervised primarily through regulation governing corporate integrity and rules on accepting client
business. A discussion of the regulatory requirements applicable to us in the Netherlands,
Luxembourg, the Cayman Islands and Jersey is set out below.

**THE NETHERLANDS**

In the Netherlands, a number of our subsidiaries provide services that are regulated and subject to
supervision by the Dutch Central Bank (De Nederlandsche Bank, the “DNB”) and the Netherlands
Authority for the Financial Markets (“AFM”) in accordance with the Act on Supervision of Trust Offices
(Wet toezicht trustkantoren, the “Wtt”), the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel
_toezicht, the “Wft”) and the Dutch Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Act (Wet ter_
_voorkoming van witwassen en financieren van terrorisme, the “Dutch AML Act”)._

**_Trust Activities_**

Pursuant to the Wtt, our subsidiaries that provide trust services in the Netherlands must obtain a
license from DNB.

DNB has granted a group license to a number of our Group companies that provide trust services
in the Netherlands. These licensed subsidiaries are subject to continuous supervision by DNB. The
services which these subsidiaries provide include acting as a director for client companies and
providing domiciliation services, corporate secretarial assistance, preparing tax returns, preparing
annual accounts and bookkeeping.

The Wtt and associated regulations require for each of these subsidiaries that:

    - the integrity of all members of the management board and supervisory board and factual
policy makers is without doubt and each such person meets the applicable suitability and
integrity requirements;

    - any individual or entity, whether residing or established in the Netherlands or abroad, obtains
prior approval from DNB for the acquiring or holding directly or indirectly of an equity interest
of 10% or more in its capital;

    - any change to the formal and actual control structure of the group of companies of which it is
part obtains prior approval from DNB; and

    - its business activities are carried out in accordance with the applicable provisions on integrity
of business operations and administration, as well as the applicable requirements regarding
administrative organization and internal control.

In addition, DNB must be informed in advance of any material changes in the direct or indirect
shareholding structure of any of our subsidiaries that provide trust services. Significant changes in our
business activities are discussed with DNB.

Pursuant to the Wtt, the formal and actual control structure of our subsidiaries that are licensed to
provide trust services in the Netherlands must be sufficiently transparent to allow DNB to effectively
supervise its business.

Non-compliance with the requirements promulgated under the Wtt may result in enforcement
action being taken by DNB. Such action may take the form of, among other things, formal instructions
(aanwijzingen), administrative fines, orders subject to an incremental penalty, increased regulatory

118


-----

compliance requirements or other potential regulatory restrictions on the our business, enforced
suspension of operations and in extreme cases, withdrawal of licenses, removal of board members or
criminal prosecution in certain circumstances. Accordingly, DNB can instruct the licensed trust
company or its corporate bodies to implement certain changes in the composition of its management
board or to replace certain policy makers that do not meet the applicable integrity requirements, may
require that such persons no longer co-determine or determine the business policy of that licensed
trust company, or require that the policy makers follow a certain course of action as determined by
DNB.

**_Dutch Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing and Dutch Sanctions Act_**

Pursuant to the Wtt and the Dutch AML Act, trust offices regulated pursuant to the Wtt must,
among other things: (i) perform a customer due diligence on all of its clients (either a simple or
extensive due diligence, depending on the profile of the potential client) prior to entering into an
agreement to provide services; (ii) perform an investigation on any ultimate beneficial owners that hold
more than 25% of a client; (iii) monitor transactions by or on behalf of the client; (iv) report suspicious
transactions to the Dutch Financial Intelligence Unit; and (iv) obtain significant knowledge on the
purpose of and rationale for a structure. Non-compliance with the requirements promulgated under the
Dutch AML Act may result in enforcement actions being taken by DNB or the AFM, which measures
may take the form of, among other things, formal instructions (aanwijzingen), administrative fines,
orders subject to an incremental penalty, increased regulatory compliance requirements or other
potential regulatory restrictions on our business and in extreme cases, withdrawal of licenses, or
criminal prosecution in certain circumstances.

**_Sanctions Act 1977_**

In accordance with the Dutch Sanctions Act 1977 (Sanctiewet 1977) our subsidiaries that provide
trust services in the Netherlands must, in addition to their obligations under the Dutch AML Act, screen
potential customers and transactions and take measures to verify whether their relationships appear on
any sanction lists (such as EU decisions and/or regulations, decisions by the Dutch Minister of Foreign
Affairs or UN Security Council Resolutions). The AFM and DNB, in their capacity of supervisory
authorities, assess and enforce the effectiveness of the procedures and measures undertaken by
institutions aimed at compliance with sanctions laws. A violation of the Dutch Sanctions Act 1977
constitutes a criminal offense and may have material implications such as criminal penalties and
administrative fines.

**_AIFMD depositary Services_**

_AIFMD-depositary Services_

The depositary services provided by certain of our subsidiaries in the Netherlands are offered
solely to open and closed-end alternative investment funds and their respective management
companies as per the Alternative Investment Fund Management Directive (“AIFMD”). Intertrust
Depositary Services B.V. (“Intertrust Depositary Services”) is licensed by the AFM as a depositary in
accordance with the Wft and it must comply with the applicable license requirements.

_Legal Framework applicable to AIFMD-depositary and Custodian Services_

The Wft and the rules promulgated thereunder require, among other things, that Intertrust
Depositary Services:

    - maintains a minimum capital of €730,000;

    - ensures that the members of its management board and supervisory board and factual policy
makers meet the applicable suitability and integrity requirements;

    - requests the AFM’s approval for any change to the formal and actual control structure of the
group of companies of which it is part;

    - pursues an adequate policy that safeguards controlled and sound business operations;

119


-----

in the fund; and

    - files its annual, audited financial statements with the AFM no later than four months after the
end of the financial year.

(“Luxembourg FS Act”) and subject to supervision by the Luxembourg Commission for the
Supervision of the Financial Sector (Commission de Surveillance Secteur Financier, the “CSSF”).
Certain of our subsidiaries hold a license as a specialized professional of the financial sector. Failure to
comply with the Luxembourg FS Act and associated rules and regulations may result in criminal and
administrative sanctions and fines in the case of significant breaches, or may result in limitations on the
activities of or loss of license, each of which may result in an inability to perform a significant portion of
our business in Luxembourg. The Luxembourg FS Act and associated rules and regulations are from
time to time amended and we monitor such developments.

**_Trust Offices_**

Certain of our Luxembourg subsidiaries provide trust services, including services that are
regulated under the Luxembourg FS Act, being the corporate domiciliation of client entities and the

companies and investment funds. Accordingly, they are authorized to maintain confidential documents,
transmit documents or information relating to client assets and services, manage mail granting access
to confidential data, and consolidate financial positions held with different financial institutions.

    - have sound administrative and accounting procedures, control and safeguard arrangements
for electronic data processing, and adequate internal control mechanisms including, in
particular, rules for personal transactions by its employees;

    - be adequately structured and organized to minimize the risk of prejudicing its clients’ interests
as a result of a conflict of interest;

adequate internal organization; and (iii) cooperate with the Luxembourg public authorities. Failure to
comply with these rules may result in criminal sanctions.

**_Reporting and Supervision_**

Pursuant to the Luxembourg FS Act, certain of our Luxembourg subsidiaries are subject to certain
reporting obligations. They may be subject to reviews and on-site audit processes conducted by the
CSSF to verify their compliance with applicable laws, regulations and circulars.

result in the inability to perform a significant portion of our business in the Cayman Islands. The
relevant laws and statements of regulatory guidance as issued by the CIMA are periodically amended
and we monitor such amendments and developments.

Although the regulation requirements vary per regulated sector, the Cayman subsidiaries subject
to Cayman regulation must comply with the applicable minimum standard of corporate governance and
administration and are required to monitor the controlling shareholdings in their share capital, in order
to establish the fitness and propriety of its management and ownership. In addition, any acquisition of
an interest in or control over such subsidiary requires approval from CIMA.

Certain of our Cayman subsidiaries are subject to review and on-site inspection by CIMA to

subsidiaries may require prior approval of CIMA. However, because our shares are listed on Euronext

122


-----

Amsterdam, the requirement for prior approval may be waived by CIMA, provided that CIMA is
informed of any change of control or acquisition of more than 10% of issued share capital or total
voting rights. CIMA has the authority to make the waiver of prior approval subject to other conditions.

**_Cayman Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing_**

Certain of our Cayman subsidiaries are required to comply with the anti-money laundering and
terrorist financing provisions imposed under the Proceeds of Crime Law (as revised) of the Cayman

ensure the operation of proper and adequate internal protocols and to pro-actively report suspicious
activities to the relevant Cayman authorities. Certain of our Cayman subsidiaries are also required to
ensure that client relationships and transactions do not infringe any sanction list which extends to the

Kingdom will generally extend to the Cayman Islands.

**JERSEY**

Certain of our Jersey subsidiaries provide services, and are registered for, financial services
business within the meaning of Article 2 of the Financial Services (Jersey) Law 1998 (“FSJL”). These
subsidiaries have been registered under Article 9 of FSJL for fund services business, investment
business and/or trust company business.

As regulated entities, such Jersey subsidiaries are subject to supervision in Jersey by the Jersey
Financial Services Commission (the “JFSC”) pursuant to FSJL and its subordinate legislation, including
the codes of practice issued by the JFSC (“Codes of Practice”) which sets out the principles and
detailed requirements that must be complied with in the conduct of financial services business. Failure
to comply with the legislation and applicable Codes of Practice may result in criminal, administrative
and monetary sanctions which may result in the inability to perform a significant portion of our business
in Jersey. In addition to the Codes of Practice, the JFSC has issued various policy statements which it
expects all regulated entities to comply with.

**_Fund Services Business_**

Certain of our Jersey subsidiaries are registered pursuant to Article 9 of FSJL to provide various
classes of fund services business, including to act as manager, administrator, registrar and manager of
a managed entity to funds that require a regulated service provider.

Our Jersey subsidiaries which hold a registration certificate for fund services business are required
to comply with the relevant articles of FSJL as well as the code of practice for fund services business
(“Code of Practice for Fund Services Business”). The Code of Practice for Fund Services Business
includes eight core principles:

(1) a registered person must conduct its business with integrity;

(2) a registered person must have due regard for the interests of the fund;

(3) a registered person must organize and control its affairs effectively for the proper performance of
its business activities and be able to demonstrate the existence of adequate risk management
systems;

(4) a registered person must be transparent in its business arrangements with the fund;

Bank AG, London Branch, Goldman Sachs Bank USA, ABN Amro Bank N.V., HSBC Bank plc. ING
Bank N.V. (as mandated lead arrangers), certain lenders named therein and Deutsche Bank

Facilities Agreement; and (ii) pay costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with the New
Facilities, including certain financing fees with respect to the New Facilities, legal and accounting
expenses and other transaction costs.

The New Facilities include the US dollar-denominated bank loan in an amount of $200,000,000
and the pound sterling-denominated bank loan in an amount of £100,000,000 (together, the “New
**Term Facilities”) and a multicurrency revolving credit facility in an amount of €150,000,000 (the “New**
**Revolving Credit Facility” and, together with the Term Facilities, the “New Facilities”). The New**
Term Facilities are borrowed by the Issuer and the New Revolving Credit Facility may be borrowed by
the Issuer and certain other members of the Group.

**_Interest and Fees_**

Loans under the New Revolving Credit Facility will initially bear interest at rates per annum equal
to EURIBOR (subject to a 0% floor), for loans denominated in euro, or for loans denominated in a
currency other than euro, LIBOR plus a margin of 1.85% per annum (which shall be subject to
reduction in accordance with a ratchet linked to the net leverage of the Group).

Loans under the New Term Facilities will initially bear interest at rates per annum equal to LIBOR
plus a margin of 2.25% per annum (which shall be subject to reduction in accordance with a ratchet
linked to the net leverage of the Group).

The Issuer is also required to pay a commitment fee, quarterly in arrear, on available but unused
commitments under the New Revolving Credit Facility at a rate of 35% per annum of the applicable
New Revolving Credit Facility margin for the period commencing on the Issue Date and ending on the
last day of the relevant availability period.

The Issuer is also required to pay a utilization fee, quarterly in arrear, which accrues on the loans
drawn under the New Revolving Credit Facility until the maturity date of the New Revolving Credit
Facility and is based on the amount of drawn New Revolving Credit Facility loans (and excluding any
drawn ancillary facility loans and/or letters of credit) as a percentage of the total commitments under
the New Revolving Credit Facility. If more than two-thirds of the New Revolving Credit Facility is drawn
by way of loans, a utilization fee equal to 0.40% is payable on such drawn loans, if less than two-thirds
but more than one-third of the New Revolving Credit Facility is drawn by way of loans, 0.30% is
payable on such drawn loans and if less than one-third of the New Revolving Credit Facility is drawn by
way of loans, a utilization fee equal to 0.15% is payable on such drawn loans.

**_Repayments_**

Each loan under the New Revolving Credit Facility will be repaid on the last day of the interest
period relating thereto, subject to a netting mechanism applicable to amounts being drawn on the same
date. Amounts made available under the New Revolving Credit Facility may be repaid and re-borrowed
during the availability period for the New Revolving Credit Facility subject to certain conditions.

the New Term Facilities.

The New Facilities Agreement contains a mechanism for incremental debt to be incurred, by way
of additional facilities, under the New Facilities Agreement. The termination date for a facility under an
additional facility commitment is the date agreed between the Issuer and the relevant lenders, provided
that (subject to limited exceptions) it shall be no earlier than (a) the maturity date for the New Term
Facilities in respect of additional term facilities ranking pari passu with the New Term Facilities, (b) the
day after the maturity date of the New Term Facilities in respect of additional term facilities ranking
junior to the New Term Facilities and (c) the maturity date for the New Revolving Credit Facility in
respect of additional revolving facilities (unless the New Revolving Facility is to be cancelled and repaid
in full after giving effect to the proceeds of such facilities).

**_Voluntary Prepayment and Mandatory Prepayment_**

The New Facilities Agreement allows for voluntary prepayments (subject to minimum amounts).
The New Facilities Agreement also permits each lender to require the mandatory prepayment of all
amounts due to that lender under the New Facilities Agreement upon a Change of Control (as defined
in the New Facilities Agreement) or illegality.

**_Guarantees_**

The Issuer and the Guarantors have (subject to certain limitations) provided guarantees of all
amounts payable to the finance parties under the New Facilities Agreement.

Group, under the New Facilities Agreement to observe certain covenants, subject to certain agreed
exceptions, including but not limited to, covenants relating to:

    - authorizations;

    - compliance with laws;

    - prohibition on entry into certain amalgamations, demergers, mergers or corporate
reconstructions;

    - prohibition on certain disposals;

    - prohibition on certain dividends, share redemptions and other restricted payments; and

    - compliance with a guarantor coverage test (see “—Guarantees”).

In addition, under the New Facilities Agreement, the Issuer must comply with a leverage finance
covenant (being the ratio of the Group’s total net debt to EBITDA (as defined in the New Facilities
Agreement)) tested on a semi-annual basis on a rolling last twelve month basis by reference to the
Group financial statements. The Issuer shall ensure that the leverage financial covenant on each
testing date shall not exceed 4.50:1 provided where the Group has completed one or more acquisitions
in the preceding 12 months with an aggregate enterprise value of €50 million or more, the Issuer may,
on three separate occasions over the life of the New Facilities, designate (in the relevant compliance
certificate) that the leverage financial covenant applicable on the relevant test date will be 5.00:1.

**_Events of Default_**

The New Facilities Agreement contains events of default which apply to the obligors, or in some cases
other members of the Group, under the New Facilities Agreement (which are subject to certain
materiality exceptions and cure periods):

    - non-payment;

    - breach of leverage financial covenant;

    - breach of other obligations under the New Facilities Agreement or any other finance
documents entered into in connection with it;

    - inaccuracy of a representation or statement when made;

    - cross-default;

    - insolvency, insolvency proceedings and similar events and elsewhere;

    - creditors’ process;

    - unlawfulness, repudiation, rescission, invalidity or unenforceability of the New Facilities

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this description under the subheading “Certain
_Definitions.” In this description, the word “Issuer” refers only to Intertrust Group B.V. and not to any of_
its subsidiaries, and the phrase “Parent Guarantor” refers only to Intertrust N.V. and not to any of its
subsidiaries.

The Issuer will issue €500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of % Senior Notes due
2025 (the “Notes”) under an indenture (the “Indenture”), to be dated on or about November,
2018, among itself, the Guarantors, Deutsche Trustee Company Limited, as trustee (the “Trustee”),
Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as paying agent, and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. as
registrar and transfer agent, in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements
of the Securities Act. See “Notice to Investors.” The Indenture is not required to be, nor will it be,
qualified under or subject to, and it will not incorporate provisions of, the United States Trust Indenture
Act of 1939, as amended.

The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and the Notes. It
does not restate those agreements in their entirety. We urge you to read the Indenture because it, and
not this description, defines your rights as Holders. Copies of the Indenture are available as set forth
below under “Additional Information.” Certain defined terms used in this description but not defined
below under “Certain Definitions” have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

**Brief Description of the Notes and the Guarantees**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes will:

    - be general unsecured obligations of the Issuer;

    - rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s existing and future senior
obligations that are not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including obligations
under the New Facilities Agreement;

    - rank senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s future obligations that are expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, if any;

    - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future secured obligations of the Issuer, the
Parent Guarantor and the Subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor to the extent of the value of
the property and assets securing such obligations;

    - be structurally subordinated to all obligations of the Parent Guarantor’s Subsidiaries that do
not guarantee the Notes; and

    - be guaranteed by the Guarantors, subject to contractual limitations that reflect limitations
under applicable law.

**_The Guarantees_**

The Notes will be, subject to contractual limitations that reflect limitations under applicable law,
guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis, by each Guarantor and each existing
and future Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor that is required to become a Guarantor in accordance
with the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Issuance of Guarantees of
_Indebtedness by Subsidiaries.” As of the Issue Date, the Guarantors will include the Parent Guarantor_
and the following Subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor: Intertrust (Netherlands) B.V., Intertrust
Administrative Services B.V., Intertrust Management B.V., Intertrust Corporate Services (Cayman)
Limited, Intertrust SPV (Cayman) Limited, Intertrust Fiduciary Services (Jersey) Limited and Intertrust
International Management Limited.

Each Guarantee of each Guarantor will:

    - be a general obligation of such Guarantor;

137


-----

    - rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior obligations of such
Guarantor that are not expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantor’s
Guarantee, including obligations under the New Facilities Agreement;

    - rank senior in right of payment to all future obligations of such Guarantor that are expressly
subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantor’s Guarantee, if any; and

    - be effectively subordinated to all existing and future secured obligations of such Guarantor to
the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such obligations.

Not all of the Parent Guarantor’s Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. In the event of a
bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor
Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to
distribute any of their assets to their parent entity. As of September 30, 2018, the Issuer and the
Guarantors represented 70% of the Group’s net assets (excluding investments in subsidiaries,
intangibles arising on business combination, intercompany balances and clearing-related assets). For
the twelve months ended September 30, 2018, the Guarantors (excluding the Parent Guarantor and
the Issuer, both of which are holding companies and had negative Adjusted EBITDA) represented 92%
of the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA and 47% of the Group’s revenue. As of September 30, 2018, after
giving effect to the Transactions, the non-Guarantor subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor would not
have had any external financial indebtedness outstanding.

The Issuer has limited operations on its own and the majority of its operating activities are
conducted through the operating Subsidiaries of the Issuer. Therefore, the Issuer depends on the cash
flow of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including obligations under the Notes. The
Notes will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all Indebtedness and other liabilities and
commitments (including trade payables and lease obligations) of the Parent Guarantor’s Subsidiaries
that do not guarantee the Notes (other than the Issuer). Any right of the Issuer or any Guarantor to
receive assets of any non-guarantor Subsidiary upon that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s liquidation or
reorganization (and the consequent right of the Holders to participate in those assets) will be effectively
subordinated to the claims of that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s creditors (including their trade creditors),
except to the extent that the Issuer or such Guarantor is itself recognized as a creditor of the
non-guarantor Subsidiary, in which case the claims of the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may
be, would still be subordinate in right of payment to any obligations secured on the assets of the
non-guarantor Subsidiary and any Indebtedness of the non-guarantor Subsidiary senior to that held by
the Issuer or such Guarantor. As of September 30, 2018, after giving effect to the offering of the Notes
and the use of proceeds therefrom, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor would
have had no external financial indebtedness.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Issuer will issue €500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes under the Indenture on
the Issue Date. The Issuer may issue Additional Notes (defined below) under the Indenture from time
to time after this offering. Such Additional Notes may not be fungible for US federal income tax
purposes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Notes and any Additional Notes subsequently issued
under the Indenture will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including,
without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. The Issuer will only be
permitted to issue Additional Notes in compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture. For all
purposes herein unless expressly stated otherwise, the term “Notes” shall include references to any
Additional Notes.

The Issuer will issue the Notes in denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in
excess thereof.

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum. Interest on the Notes will:

    - be payable, in cash, semi-annually in arrear on and, in each year, commencing
on, 2019;

    - be payable to the Holders of record of the Notes on the Business Day immediately preceding
and respectively;

138


-----

    - be payable on the aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding;

    - accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most
recently paid;

    - be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months; and

    - each interest period shall end on (but not include) the relevant interest payment date.

The Notes will be payable at % of their face amount at maturity. The Notes will mature on
, 2025.

**Additional Notes**

From time to time, subject to the Issuer’s compliance with the covenants described under the
headings “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Issuance of Guarantees of Indebtedness by Subsidiaries,”
the Issuer is permitted to issue additional Notes, which shall have terms substantially identical to the
Notes except in respect of any of the following terms which shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate
delivered by the Issuer to the Trustee (“Additional Notes”):

(1) the title of such Additional Notes;

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Notes;

(3) the date or dates on which such Additional Notes will be issued;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Notes shall bear interest
and, if applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such interest rate
or rates, the date or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment dates on
which such interest shall be payable or the method by which such dates will be determined, the
record dates for the determination of holders thereof to whom such interest is payable and the
basis upon which such interest will be calculated;

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Notes shall be denominated and the currency
in which cash or government obligations in connection with such series of Additional Notes may be
payable;

(6) the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which, and the terms
and conditions upon which, such Additional Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part;

(7) if other than in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess
thereof, the denominations in which such Additional Notes shall be issued and redeemed; and

(8) the ISIN, Common Code or other securities identification numbers with respect to such Additional
Notes.

Such Additional Notes will be treated, along with all other Notes, as a single class for the purposes
of the Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments and all other matters which are not specifically
distinguished for such series. Unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes of the Indenture
and this Description of the Notes, references to “Notes” shall be deemed to include references to the
Notes initially issued on the Issue Date as well as any Additional Notes. However, in order for any
Additional Notes to have the same ISIN, CUSIP or Common Code, as applicable, as the Notes, such
Additional Notes must be fungible with the Notes for US federal income tax purposes.

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes**

Methods of receiving payments on global Notes are described under “Book-Entry; Delivery and
_Form—Payments on Global Notes.”_

The rights of holders of beneficial interests in the Notes to receive the payments on such Notes
are subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream. If the due date for any payment in
respect of any Notes is not a Business Day, such holders will not be entitled to payment of the amount
due until the next succeeding Business Day, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other
payment as a result of any such delay.

139


-----

In the case of certificated Notes, if a Holder has given wire transfer instructions to the Issuer, the
Issuer will pay all interest, premium, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, on that Holder’s Note in
accordance with those instructions. Payments on Notes will be made through the office or agency of
one or more paying agents maintained for such purposes in London, United Kingdom, as described
under “Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes” for the Notes.

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents for the Notes, including one paying agent in
London, United Kingdom (the “Paying Agent”). Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, will initially act as
the Paying Agent for the Notes.

The Issuer will also maintain one or more registrars (each, a “Registrar”) for so long as the Notes
are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. will
act as Registrar for the Notes. The Issuer will also maintain a transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”) in
Luxembourg. Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. will initially act as the Transfer Agent for the Notes.

The Issuer may change the Paying Agent, the Registrar or the Transfer Agent without prior notice
to the Holders. The Parent Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent, Registrar or
Transfer Agent in respect of the Notes; provided that if and for so long as the Notes are listed on the
Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Global Exchange
Market thereof and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish a
notice of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent in a newspaper having a general
circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the
manner permitted by such rules, post such notice on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange (www.bourse.lu).

**Transfer and Exchange**

A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The Registrar, the
Trustee and any Paying Agent may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate
endorsements and transfer documents. The Issuer is not required to transfer or exchange any Note
selected for redemption. No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of
the Notes, but the Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge payable in connection with the transfer or exchange. The Holder of a Note will be
treated as the owner of it for all purposes. See “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form”.

**Guarantees**

The Notes, subject to contractual limitations that reflect limitations under applicable law, will be
guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior basis by the Guarantors. As of the Issue Date, the
Guarantors will be the entities set forth above under “Brief Description of the Notes and the
_Guarantees—The Guarantees.”_

The Indenture will limit the obligation to grant guarantees in favor of obligations under the Notes.
The Indenture will include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such
grant would be restricted by general statutory limitations, financial assistance, capital maintenance,
corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, retention of title claims and similar
principles. The obligations of the Guarantors will be contractually limited under the applicable
Guarantees to reflect these limitations and other legal restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and
their respective shareholders, directors and general partners. See “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_Guarantees Release_**

The Guarantee of any Guarantor will be released upon repayment in full of the Notes or upon legal
defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture, as provided under
“Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” and “Satisfaction and Discharge.”

140


-----

The Guarantee of a Subsidiary Guarantor will be released:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of that
Subsidiary Guarantor (including by way of merger or consolidation) to a Person that is not (either
before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Parent Guarantor or a Subsidiary of the Parent
Guarantor;

(2) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Capital Stock of that Subsidiary Guarantor or its
direct or indirect parent entity to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such
transaction) the Parent Guarantor or a Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor, if the Subsidiary
Guarantor ceases to be a Subsidiary as a result of the sale or other disposition;

(3) upon the release of its guarantee by a Subsidiary Guarantor under the New Facilities Agreement
(including, without limitation, upon repayment of obligations outstanding under the New Facilities
Agreement); provided that no other Indebtedness is at that time guaranteed by the relevant
Subsidiary Guarantor that would have otherwise given rise to an obligation to guarantee the Notes
pursuant to the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Issuance of
_Guarantees of Indebtedness by Subsidiaries” had the relevant Subsidiary not already been a_
Subsidiary Guarantor; _provided_ _further_ that should such Subsidiary Guarantor thereafter
guarantee obligations under the New Facilities Agreement (or such guarantee under the New
Facilities Agreement is reinstated or renewed), then such Subsidiary Guarantor will guarantee the
Notes on the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture;

(4) upon repayment in full of the Notes or upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction
and discharge of the Indenture, as provided under “Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance”
and “Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(5) as described under “Amendment, Supplement and Waiver”; or

(6) upon the release of the guarantee that gave rise to the requirement to guarantee the Notes
pursuant to the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Issuance of
_Guarantees of Indebtedness by Subsidiaries,” so long as no Event of Default exists at the time of_
such release or would arise as a result thereof, and so long as no other Indebtedness is at that
time guaranteed by the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor that would have otherwise given rise to an
obligation to guarantee the Notes pursuant to such covenant had the relevant Subsidiary not
already been a Subsidiary Guarantor.

Upon any occurrence giving rise to a release as specified above, the Trustee will, at the request
and expense of the Issuer, and subject to the receipt of certain documents reasonably requested by
the Trustee, execute any documents reasonably necessary in order to evidence or effect such release,
discharge and termination in respect of such guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to
customary protections and indemnifications. Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will be required to
make a notation on the Notes to reflect any such release, termination or discharge. Each of the
releases and amendments set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee without any consent of the
Holders or any other action or consent on the part of the Trustee.

**Optional Redemption**

At any time prior to, 2021, the Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole or in part, at its
option, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice to the Holders as described
under the heading “Selection and Notice” at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount
of such Notes plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date occurring on or prior
to, but excluding, the redemption date).

141


-----

At any time and from time to time on or after, 2021, the Issuer may redeem the Notes in
whole or in part, at its option, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice to the
Holders as described under the heading “Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to the
percentage of principal amount set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the
redemption date:

**Twelve month period commencing** **in** **Percentage**

2021 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . %
2022 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . %
2023 and thereafter . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 100.000%

At any time and from time to time prior to, 2021, the Issuer may, at its option, upon notice
as described under the heading “Selection and Notice”, redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal
amount of Notes (including Additional Notes) at a redemption price equal to (i) % of the
aggregate principal amount thereof, with an amount equal to or less than the net cash proceeds of one
or more Equity Offerings to the extent such net cash proceeds are received by or contributed to the
Parent Guarantor, plus (ii) accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable
redemption date; provided that:

(1) in each case the redemption takes place not later than 180 days after the closing of the related
Equity Offering; and

(2) not less than 50% of the principal amount of the Notes originally issued on the Issue Date
(excluding the principal amount of any Additional Notes) remain outstanding immediately
thereafter (unless all such Notes are redeemed substantially concurrently).

Notice of any redemption upon any Equity Offering may be given prior to the completion thereof.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Notes, if Holders of not
less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes validly tender and do not
withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third-party making such a tender offer
in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the
Issuer or such third-party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice
to the Holders, given not more than 30 days following such purchase date, to redeem all Notes that
remain outstanding following such purchase at a price equal to the price paid to each other Holder in
such tender offer (other than any incentive payment for early tenders), plus, to the extent not included
in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to,
but not including, the redemption date. In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the
aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have validly tendered and not withdrawn
Notes in a tender offer or other offer to purchase for all of the Notes, as applicable, Notes owned by an
Affiliate of the Issuer or by funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor
thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer or other offer, as
applicable.

Notwithstanding anything else in the Indenture or the Notes, redemption notices may be given
more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is in connection with a defeasance of a
series of Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture.

Any redemption and notice of redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the
satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent (including, in the case of a redemption of the Notes
related to an Equity Offering, the consummation of such Equity Offering); provided that in no case shall
such notice have been delivered less than 10 days or more than 60 days prior to the date on which
such redemption, if any, occurs. In addition, if such redemption or notice is subject to satisfaction of
one or more conditions precedent, such notice may state that, at the Issuer’s discretion, the
redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such
redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such
conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed;
_provided further that in no case shall the notice have been delivered less than 10 days or more than_
60 days prior to the date on which such redemption, if any, occurs (except that redemption notices may

142


-----

be mailed or otherwise transmitted more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued
in connection with a defeasance of a series of Notes as provided in “Legal Defeasance and Covenant
_Defeasance” or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as provided in “Satisfaction and_
_Discharge”)._

If the Issuer effects an optional redemption of the Notes, it will, for so long as the Notes are listed
on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Authority so require, inform
the Authority of such optional redemption and confirm the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that
will remain outstanding immediately after such redemption.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related
interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the
Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be
payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

If a redemption date is not a Business Day, payment may be made on the next succeeding day
that is a Business Day, and no interest shall accrue on any amount that would have been otherwise
payable on such redemption date if it were a Business Day for the intervening period.

We may repurchase Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or otherwise.

**Selection and Notice**

If fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit
their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions)
or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate unless otherwise required by law or
applicable stock exchange or depositary requirements, provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest
of less than €100,000 principal amount may be redeemed in part. If the Notes are not held through
Euroclear or Clearstream, or Euroclear or Clearstream prescribes no method of selection, the Notes
will be selected on a pro rata basis; provided that no Note of €100,000 in aggregate principal amount
or less, or other than in an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof, shall be redeemed in part. The
Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Registrar shall not be liable for selections of Notes made in
accordance with this paragraph.

If the Issuer elects to redeem the Notes or portions thereof and requests the Trustee to distribute
to the Holders any amounts deposited in trust (which, for the avoidance of doubt, will include accrued
and unpaid interest to the date fixed for redemption) prior to the date fixed for redemption in
accordance with the provisions set forth under “Satisfaction and Discharge,” the applicable redemption
notice will state that Holders will receive such amounts deposited in trust prior to the date fixed for
redemption and mention the payment date.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
and admitted for trading on the Global Exchange Market and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange so require, not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, the Issuer
will, if the Notes are in certificated form, mail notice of redemption to Holders by first-class mail,
postage prepaid, at their respective addresses as they appear on the registration books of the
Registrar.

For Notes which are represented by global Notes held on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream,
notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear or Clearstream for communication
to entitled account holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing. So long as any Notes are listed on
the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Global Exchange
Market and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, any such notice to the Holders of
the relevant Notes shall also be published in a newspaper having a general circulation in Luxembourg
(which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such
rules, posted on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu) and, in
connection with any redemption, the Issuer will notify the Luxembourg Stock Exchange of any change
in the principal amount of Notes outstanding.

143


-----

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall
state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a certificated Note, a
new Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note will be issued in the
name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. In the case of a global Note, an
appropriate notation will be made on such Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount
equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for
redemption. On and after the redemption date, unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the
redemption price, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer may, at its option, redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving
not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice to the Holders (which notice will be irrevocable), at
a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of
Holders of record of certificated Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts (see “Withholding Taxes”), if any, then due
and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if
the Issuer, a Surviving Entity, any Guarantor or a successor of any of the foregoing (a “Payor”)
reasonably determines that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the laws or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any change in, or amendment to, or the introduction of, an official position regarding the
application, administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including
a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in administrative
practice) (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

the relevant Payor is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Notes would be, required to
pay Additional Amounts, and the Payor cannot avoid such obligation by taking reasonable measures
available to it (which does not include, for the avoidance of doubt, assignment of the obligation to make
payment with respect to the Notes). In the case of redemption due to withholding as a result of a
Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that is a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at the date of this Offering
Memorandum, such Change in Tax Law must become effective after the date of this Offering
Memorandum. In the case of redemption due to withholding as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a
jurisdiction that becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction after the date of this Offering Memorandum,
such Change in Tax Law must become effective on or after the date the jurisdiction becomes a
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction. Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance
with the procedures under “Notices.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will
be given earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor or Note Guarantor, as
applicable, would be obligated to make such payment or withholding if a payment in respect of the
Notes were then due. Prior to the giving of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the
foregoing, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to
effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of fact showing that the conditions precedent to its
right to redeem have been satisfied and that it would not be able to avoid the obligation to pay
Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it and (b) an opinion of an independent
tax counsel of recognized standing qualified under the laws of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee to the effect that such Payor has been or will become obligated
to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be
entitled to rely absolutely and without further inquiry on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as
sufficient existence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, in which event it
will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**Mandatory Redemption**

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to
the Notes.

-----

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of a Payor on the Notes or any Note Guarantee will be made
free and clear of, and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future
taxes, duties, levies, imposts, assessments or other governmental charges of whatever nature
including penalties, interest and any other additions thereto (“Taxes”), unless the withholding or
deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of,
any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of (1) any jurisdiction in which the Payor is incorporated,
organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise considered resident for tax purposes or
any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having power to tax, or (2) any
jurisdiction from or through which payment under or with respect to the Notes or any of the Note
Guarantees is made by or on behalf of the Payor or any political subdivision or governmental authority
thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing
**Jurisdiction”) will at any time be required from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor under**
or with respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee, including, without limitation, payments of principal,
redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such
additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts
received in respect of such payments by the Holders after such withholding or deduction (including any
such deduction or withholding from such Additional Amounts) equal the amounts which would have
been received in respect of such payments in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided
that no such Additional Amounts will be payable with respect to:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been imposed but for the Holder (or a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary,
member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over, the relevant Holder, if the relevant
Holder is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) or
beneficial owner having any present or former connection with such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
(including, without limitation, being resident for tax purposes, being a citizen or resident or national
of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being physically
present in, such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) other than a connection arising from the acquisition,
ownership or holding of such Note or enforcement of rights thereunder or the receipt of payments
in respect of the Notes or with respect to any Guarantee;

(2) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial
owner of the Note to comply with a written request of the Payor addressed to the Holder or
beneficial owner, after reasonable notice, to provide certification, information, documents or other
evidence concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or
satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a statute,
treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to
exemption from all or part of such Taxes, but only to the extent that the Holder or beneficial owner
is legally eligible to provide such certification or other evidence;

(3) any Taxes imposed as a result of the presentation of any Note for payment (where presentation is
required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the
Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had
the Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period);

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from payments made
under or with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar Tax;

(6) any Taxes imposed, deducted or withheld pursuant to section 1471(b) of the Code or otherwise
imposed pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, in each case, as of the Issue Date
(and any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable and not materially more
onerous to comply with), any current or future regulations or agreements thereunder, official
interpretations thereof or any law implementing an intergovernmental agreement relating thereto;
or

(7) any combination of clauses (1) through (6) above.

145


-----

Such Additional Amounts will also not be payable where, had the beneficial owner of the Note
been the Holder of the Note, it would not have been entitled to payment of Additional Amounts by
reason of clauses (1) to (7) inclusive above.

The applicable withholding agent will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit
the full amount deducted or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable
law. Upon written request, the Payor will use reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts
evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
imposing such Taxes. The Payor will provide such certified copies or, if certified copies are not
available notwithstanding such person’s attempt to obtain them, other evidence of payment reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee, as soon as reasonably practical to the Trustee and the Paying Agent.

Wherever in the Indenture or this Description of the Notes there is mentioned, in any context, the
payment of (1) principal, (2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes, (3) interest or
(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to the Notes or the Guarantees, such reference shall
be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under this heading to the extent
that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment made under or
with respect to any Note or Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor
will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional
Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information
necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment
date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant
payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable
thereafter). The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s
Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

The Payor will pay, and reimburse the Holder, for any present or future stamp, issue, registration,
transfer, court or documentary taxes, or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies
(including any penalties, interest and any other reasonable expenses related thereto) which arise in
any jurisdiction from the execution, delivery, issuance or registration of any Notes, the Guarantees, the
Indenture or any other document or instrument referred to therein, upon original issuance and initial
resale of the Notes (other than a transfer of the Notes subsequent to this offering), or in connection
with the enforcement of the Notes, any Guarantee, the Indenture or any other document or instrument
referred to therein or in connection with the receipt of any payments under or with respect to the Notes
(limited to any such taxes, charges or similar levies that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (3)
or (5) through (7) above or any combination thereof), excluding, in each case, any such taxes, charges
or similar levies imposed by any jurisdiction outside a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, other than those
resulting from, or required to be paid in connection with, the enforcement of the Notes, the Guarantees
or any other such document or instrument following the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect
to the Notes.

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture
and any transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner.

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

**_Change of Control_**

If a Change of Control occurs, each Holder of the Notes will have the right to require the Issuer to
repurchase all or any part (equal to €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof in the
case of Notes that have denominations larger than €100,000) of that Holder’s Notes pursuant to an
offer (the “Change of Control Offer”) on the terms set forth in the Indenture. In the Change of Control
Offer, the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor will offer a payment (the “Change of Control Payment”) in
cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of each of the Notes repurchased plus accrued
and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to the date of repurchase.

Unless the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the
Notes and given notice of redemption as described under “Optional Redemption” and all conditions to

146


-----

such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change
of Control, the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor will deliver a notice to each Holder and the Trustee
describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to
repurchase Notes on a date (the “Change of Control Payment Date”) specified in such notice, which
date shall be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered,
pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice. The Issuer or the
Parent Guarantor will comply with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act to the extent
applicable and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and
regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of
Control. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change
of Control provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor will comply with applicable
securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the
Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such conflict.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor will, to the extent
lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof validly tendered pursuant to the Change of
Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the relevant Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in
respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered; and

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Registrar or the Paying Agent the Notes so accepted
together with an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of such Notes or
portions thereof being purchased by the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor.

The Paying Agent will promptly deliver to each Holder of Notes so tendered the Change of Control
Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee or the Registrar will, upon receipt of an Issuer order,
promptly authenticate and deliver (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder a new Note
equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that
each such new Note will be in a principal amount of €100,000 or an integral multiple of €1,000 in
excess thereof.

If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of all of the then outstanding Notes
validly tender and do not validly withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer, and the Issuer, or
any third-party making an offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Notes
validly tendered and not validly withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third-party will have the
right, upon not less than 10 days’ nor more than 60 days’ prior notice; provided that such notice is
given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer
described above, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase on a date (the
“Second Change of Control Payment Date”) at a price in cash equal to the Change of Control
Payment in respect of the Second Change of Control Payment Date. In determining whether the
Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of all of the then outstanding Notes have
validly tendered and not withdrawn Notes in a Change of Control Offer to purchase all of the Notes,
Notes owned by an Affiliate of the Issuer or by funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the
Issuer, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such Change
of Control Offer.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
and admitted for trading on the Global Exchange Market and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish a public announcement with respect to the results of any
Change of Control Offer in a leading newspaper having a general circulation in Luxembourg (which is
expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules,
post such notice on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu).

The provisions described above that require the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor to make a Change
of Control Offer following a Change of Control will be applicable regardless of whether any other
provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of

147


-----

Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer or
the Parent Guarantor repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or
similar transaction.

The Issuer or the Parent Guarantor will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer
following a Change of Control if (i) a third-party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at
the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a
Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor and purchases all Notes validly
tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption for all of
the outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture under “Optional Redemption” unless
and until there is a default in the payment of the applicable redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid
interest to the proposed redemption date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the
Indenture or the Notes, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control,
conditional upon the consummation of the Change of Control, so long as a definitive agreement has
been executed that contains terms and provisions that would otherwise result in a Change of Control
upon completion of the transactions contemplated thereby.

The Issuer or the Parent Guarantor’s ability to repurchase Notes pursuant to a Change of Control
Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a
Change of Control may constitute a default, or constitute a mandatory prepayment event, under the
New Facilities Agreement. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under the
New Facilities Agreement and cause a default may not constitute a Change of Control under the
Indenture. In addition, future Indebtedness of the Parent Guarantor and its Subsidiaries may also
contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such
Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. The exercise by the Holders of their right
to require the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under
such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such
repurchase on the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor. Finally, the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor’s ability
to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor’s
then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available
when necessary to make any required repurchases.

Even if sufficient funds were otherwise available, the terms of other Indebtedness may prohibit the
Issuer or the Parent Guarantor’s prepayment of Notes prior to their scheduled maturity. Consequently,
if the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor is not able to prepay such Indebtedness or obtain requisite
consents, the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor will be unable to fulfill its repurchase obligations if
Holders of Notes exercise their repurchase rights following a Change of Control, thereby resulting in a
default under the Indenture. A default under the Indenture may result in a cross-default under such
other Indebtedness.

The Change of Control provisions described above may deter certain mergers, tender offers and
other takeover attempts involving the Parent Guarantor by increasing the capital required to effectuate
such transactions. The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or
indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the
properties or assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited
body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of
the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a Holder of Notes to require the Issuer or
the Parent Guarantor to repurchase such Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or
other disposition of less than all of the assets of the Parent Guarantor and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole to another Person or group may be uncertain.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Negative Pledge_**

The Parent Guarantor will not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, secure any
Indebtedness for money borrowed by placing a Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) on any Principal
Property now or hereafter owned or leased by the Parent Guarantor or any Subsidiary of the Parent

148


-----

Guarantor or on any shares of stock of any Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor without equally and
ratably securing (or securing on a senior basis, in the case of a Lien securing Indebtedness for money
borrowed that is by its terms expressly subordinated to the Notes or any Guarantee) all of the Notes.
The restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence will not apply to any Permitted Lien.

Any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall provide
by its terms that such Lien shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon
the release and discharge of the Lien relating to such Indebtedness that gave rise to the obligation to
so secure the Notes.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness
at the time of the incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any
Increased Amount of such Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean
any increase in the amount of such Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the
accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the
form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of original issue discount or liquidation
preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations
in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Issuance of Guarantees of Indebtedness by Subsidiaries_**

The Parent Guarantor will not cause or permit any of its Subsidiaries that is not the Issuer or a
Guarantor, directly or indirectly, to guarantee, assume or in any other manner become liable for the
payment of any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor (a) under the New Facilities Agreement or
any other Credit Facilities or (b) that constitutes Public Indebtedness, unless such Subsidiary executes
and delivers a supplemental indenture to the Indenture providing for a Guarantee of payment of the
Notes by such Subsidiary on the same terms as the guarantee of such Indebtedness within
30 Business Days thereof; provided that if such Indebtedness is by its terms expressly subordinated in
right of payment to the Notes or any Guarantee, any such guarantee, assumption or other liability of
such Subsidiary with respect to such Indebtedness shall be subordinated to such Subsidiary’s
Guarantee of the Notes at least to the same extent as such Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes
or any other Guarantee; provided further that (x) this covenant shall not be applicable to any
Indebtedness arising from Permitted Intercompany Activities and (y) such Subsidiary shall not be
obliged to become a Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the granting of such Guarantee could
give rise to or result in: (i) any breach or violation of general statutory limitations, financial assistance,
capital maintenance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference or thin capitalization rules, retention of
title to claims or the laws, rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; or
(ii) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or shareholders of such Subsidiary (or, in the case of a
Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or
(iii) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) to the extent such
cost, expense, liability or obligation are disproportionate to the benefit obtained by the Holders with
respect to the receipt of the guarantee (as determined in good faith by the Parent Guarantor).

In addition, the Parent Guarantor shall procure that, in the event Intertrust (Luxembourg) S.à r.l.
(“Intertrust Luxembourg”) makes an intercompany loan of an aggregate outstanding principal amount
in excess of €10 million from the proceeds of third-party Indebtedness in the nature of loan facilities,
bonds, notes or other debt securities borrowed or incurred by Intertrust Luxembourg to the Issuer or a
Guarantor where such intercompany loan will remain outstanding for more than 364 calendar days (but
excluding any trade credit in the ordinary course of trading), Intertrust Luxembourg will subordinate its
claims under such intercompany loan in favor of the Holders in respect of all obligations under the
Indenture, on customary terms for subordinating intercompany loans, within 45 days of making any
such intercompany loan.

To the extent the Parent Guarantor becomes aware of a change in the regulatory environment in
Luxembourg such that Intertrust Luxembourg would be permitted to provide a Guarantee and
guarantee the borrowings under the New Facilities Agreement, it shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide such guarantees as soon as reasonably practicable.

149


-----

To the extent any Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor is required to provide a Guarantee, such
Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors
(including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial
assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting
the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

**_Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets_**

_The Issuer_

The Issuer may not, directly or indirectly: (1) consolidate or merge with or into another Person
(whether or not the Issuer is the surviving corporation); or (2) sell, assign, transfer, convey, lease or
otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to another Person; unless:

(1) either: (a) the Issuer is the surviving corporation; or (b) the Person formed by or surviving any such
consolidation or merger (if other than the Issuer) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer,
conveyance, lease or other disposition shall have been made (the “Surviving Entity”) is a
company organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District
of Columbia, the United Kingdom, Switzerland or any member of the European Economic Area;

(2) the Surviving Entity (if other than the Issuer) assumes all the obligations of the Issuer under the
Notes and the Indenture pursuant to the execution and delivery to the Trustee of a supplemental
indenture and other applicable agreements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee;

(3) immediately after such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists;

(4) each Guarantor (unless it is the other party to the transactions above, in which case clause
(1) shall apply) shall have by supplemental indenture confirmed that its Guarantee shall apply to
such Person’s obligations in respect of the Indenture and the Notes (unless such Guarantee shall
be released in connection with the transaction and otherwise in compliance with the Indenture);
and

(5) the Issuer or the Surviving Entity shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an
Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such
supplemental indenture, if any, comply with the terms of the Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel
to the effect that in the case of the Surviving Entity, such supplemental indenture, if any, has been
duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and binding agreement enforceable
against the Surviving Entity (in each case, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee); provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officers’
Certificate as to any matters of fact.

Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (3) and (5) and the provisions described below under
“—The Parent Guarantor” (which do not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence), (a) any
Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer
all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer and (b) any Subsidiary other than the Issuer or a
Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties
and assets to any other Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor. Notwithstanding the preceding
clauses (3) and (5) (which shall not apply to the transactions referred to in this sentence), the Issuer
may consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the
purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Issuer, reincorporating the Issuer in another jurisdiction
or changing the legal form of the Issuer.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (3) of the first paragraph of this
covenant) will not apply to the creation of a new subsidiary of the Issuer that becomes a parent of one
or more of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries.

_The Parent Guarantor_

The Parent Guarantor may not, directly or indirectly: (1) consolidate or merge with or into another
Person (whether or not the Parent Guarantor is the surviving corporation); or (2) sell, assign, transfer,
convey, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Parent

150


-----

Guarantor and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to another
Person; unless:

(1) either: (a) the Parent Guarantor is the surviving corporation; or (b) the Surviving Entity is a
company organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District
of Columbia, the United Kingdom, Switzerland or any member of the European Economic Area;

(2) the Surviving Entity (if other than the Parent Guarantor) assumes all the obligations of the Parent
Guarantor under the Indenture pursuant to the execution and delivery to the Trustee of a
supplemental indenture and other applicable agreements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee;

(3) immediately after such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists; and

(4) the Parent Guarantor or the Surviving Entity shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or
transfer and such supplemental indenture, if any, comply with the terms of the Indenture and an
Opinion of Counsel to the effect that in the case of the Surviving Entity, such supplemental
indenture, if any, has been duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and
binding agreement enforceable against the Surviving Entity (in each case, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee); provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel
may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact.

Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (3) and (4) and the provisions described above under
“—The Issuer” (which do not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence), (a) any Subsidiary of
the Parent Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of
its properties and assets to the Parent Guarantor and (b) any Subsidiary other than the Issuer or a
Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties
and assets to any other Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor. Notwithstanding the preceding
clauses (3) and (4) (which shall not apply to the transactions referred to in this sentence), the Parent
Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or
organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Parent Guarantor, reincorporating the
Parent Guarantor in another jurisdiction or changing the legal form of the Parent Guarantor.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (3) of the first paragraph of this
covenant) will not apply to the creation of a new subsidiary as a Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor.

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of a
Person, which properties and assets, if held by such Person instead of such Subsidiaries, would
constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of such Person on a consolidated basis,
shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of such
Person.

**_Reports_**

For so long as any Notes are outstanding and subject to the paragraphs that follow, the Parent
Guarantor will provide to each of the Trustee and the Holders of Notes and potential purchasers of
Notes:

(1) within 120 days after the end of the Parent Guarantor’s fiscal year, annual reports containing the
following information: (a) audited consolidated balance sheet of the Parent Guarantor as of the
end of the two most recent fiscal years and audited consolidated income statements and
statements of cash flow of the Parent Guarantor for the two most recent fiscal years, including
footnotes to such financial statements and the report of the independent auditors on the financial
statements; (b) an operating and financial review of the audited financial statements, including a
discussion of the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital resources, and
a discussion of material commitments and contingencies and critical accounting policies; (c) a
description of the business, management and shareholders of the Parent Guarantor, all material
affiliate transactions, Indebtedness and material financing arrangements and a description of all
material contractual arrangements, including material debt instruments; and (d) risk factors and
material recent developments;

151


-----

(2) within 90 days following the end of the second quarter in each of the Parent Guarantor’s fiscal
years, reports containing the following information: (a) an unaudited condensed consolidated
balance sheet as of the end of such semi-annual period and unaudited condensed statements of
income and cash flow for the year-to-date periods ending on the unaudited condensed balance
sheet date, and the comparable prior year periods for the Parent Guarantor, together with
condensed footnote disclosure; (b) an operating and financial review of the unaudited financial
statements, including a discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations
of the Parent Guarantor and any material change between the current period and the
corresponding period of the prior year; (c) material developments in the business of the Parent
Guarantor and its Subsidiaries; (d) financial developments and trends in the business in which the
Parent Guarantor and its Subsidiaries are engaged; and (e) material recent developments; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of (a) any senior executive officer change at the Parent Guarantor;
(b) any change in the auditors of the Parent Guarantor; (c) any resignation of a member of the
Board of Directors of the Parent Guarantor as a result of a disagreement with the Parent
Guarantor; (d) the entering into an agreement that will result in a Change of Control; or (e) any
material events that the Parent Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries announces publicly, in each
case, a report containing a description of such events.

The Parent Guarantor will furnish to the Trustee such other information that it is required to make
publicly available under the requirements of Euronext Amsterdam as a result of having its ordinary
shares admitted for trading on such exchange. Notwithstanding the first paragraph of this covenant,
upon the Parent Guarantor complying with the public reporting requirements of Euronext Amsterdam
(regardless of whether the Parent Guarantor’s ordinary shares are admitted for trading on such
exchange), to the extent that such requirements include an obligation to prepare and make publicly
available annual reports, information, documents and other reports with Euronext Amsterdam, the
Parent Guarantor will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in clauses (1) through
(3) of the preceding paragraph.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent Guarantor will be deemed to have provided such
information to the Trustee, the Holders and prospective purchasers of the Notes if such information
referenced above in clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph above or alternatively, in the
preceding paragraph, has been posted on the Parent Guarantor’s website.

Delivery of any information, documents and reports to the Trustee pursuant to this “Reports”
covenant is for informational purposes only and the Trustee’s receipt of such shall not constitute
constructive notice of any information contained therein, including the Parent Guarantor’s compliance
with any of its covenants under the Indenture.

**Events of Default and Remedies**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Indenture:

(1) default for 30 days in the payment when due of interest on, or Additional Amounts with respect to,
the Notes;

(2) default in payment when due and payable of the principal of, or premium, if any, on the Notes;

(3) failure by the Parent Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries for 60 days after receipt of written notice
by the Trustee or by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes to
comply with any of the other agreements in the Indenture;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued and outstanding
any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Parent Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries (or the
payment of which is guaranteed by the Parent Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries) whether such
Indebtedness or guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, if that default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at the final stated maturity of such Indebtedness (after
giving effect to any applicable grace period provided in the Indebtedness) (a “Payment
**Default”); or**

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express maturity,

152


-----

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal
amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a Payment Default or the
maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates the greater of €35.0 million and 18.0% of
Consolidated Pro Forma EBITDA or more; and

(5) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Issuer, the Parent Guarantor or any
of its Significant Subsidiaries.

In the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with
respect to the Issuer, the Parent Guarantor or a Significant Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor, all
outstanding Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any
other Event of Default occurs and is continuing of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has
received written notice in accordance with the Indenture, the Trustee (upon request of Holders of at
least 30% in principal amount of Notes then outstanding) shall, by notice in writing to the Issuer and the
Parent Guarantor, or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes
may, by notice in writing to the Issuer, the Parent Guarantor and the Trustee, declare the principal of,
premium, if applicable, and accrued and unpaid interest, and Additional Amounts, if any, on all Notes
under the Indenture to be due and payable and such notice shall specify the respective Event of
Default and that such notice is a “notice of acceleration,” and such principal, premium, accrued and
unpaid interest and Additional Amounts shall become immediately due and payable. In the event of
any Event of Default specified in clause (4), above, such Event of Default and all consequences
thereof (including, without limitation, any acceleration or resulting payment default) shall be annulled,
waived and rescinded automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders, if within 30
days after such Event of Default arose, (1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such
Event of Default has been discharged, (2) the creditors on such Indebtedness have rescinded or
waived the acceleration, notice or action, as the case may be, giving rise to such Event of Default or
(3) if the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured.

Subject to conditions specified in the Indenture, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding by written notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of
all Notes waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture
except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal, interest, premium, if any,
and Additional Amounts, if any with respect to the Notes. Holders of Notes may not enforce the
Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any
trust or power.

The Trustee shall be obligated to notify the Holders of Notes of all Defaults actually known to the
Trustee within 60 days after receiving written notice from the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor of the
occurrence of a Default unless the applicable Default shall have been cured. The Trustee may withhold
from Holders notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default (except a Default or Event of Default
relating to the payment of principal or interest or Additional Amounts) if it determines that withholding
notice is in their interest.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of
Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or
powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have
offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to the
Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense caused by taking or not taking such
action. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, interest when due,
and Additional Amounts, if any, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the
Notes, unless:

(1) the Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee
to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee indemnity and/or security (including by way of pre-funding)
satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense;

153


-----

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and
the offer of the indemnity and/or security (including by way of pre-funding); and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a
direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day
period.

The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or
that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve
the Trustee in personal liability.

It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and,
accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the
provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.

The Parent Guarantor is required to deliver to the Trustee annually an Officer’s Certificate
regarding compliance with the Indenture within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year. Upon
becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, the Parent Guarantor is required to deliver, within
30 days after the occurrence thereof, to the Trustee a written statement specifying such Default or
Event of Default, their status and what action the Parent Guarantor is taking or proposes to take in
respect thereof.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Issuer or any Guarantor, as such,
shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor under the Notes, the
Guarantees or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations
or their creation. Each Holder of Notes by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The
waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. The waiver may not be
effective to waive liabilities under the United States federal or other applicable securities laws.

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have all of its obligations discharged with
respect to the outstanding Notes and all obligations of the Guarantors discharged with respect to their
Guarantees (“Legal Defeasance”) except for:

(1) the rights of Holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, or
interest, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on such Notes when such payments are due
(including on a redemption date) from the trust referred to below;

(2) the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes, mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and
money for security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuer’s and the
Guarantors’ obligations in connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

If the Issuer exercises its Legal Defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated
because of an Event of Default. In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have
its obligations and the obligations of the Guarantors released with respect to certain covenants that are
described in the Indenture (“Covenant Defeasance”) and thereafter payment on the Notes may not be
accelerated because of an Event of Default relating to any omission to comply with those covenants. In
the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, payment on the Notes may not be accelerated because of an
Event of Default relating to certain events (not including non-payment, bankruptcy, receivership,
rehabilitation and insolvency events) described under “Events of Default and Remedies” with respect to
the Notes.

154


-----

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(1) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee or such entity designated or appointed (as
agent) by the Trustee for this purpose, in trust, for the benefit of the Holders, cash in euro,
European Government Obligations or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient,
in the opinion of an internationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, to pay the
principal of, interest, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on the outstanding Notes on the
stated maturity or on the applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and the Issuer must
specify whether the Notes are being defeased to maturity or to a particular redemption date;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of
Counsel qualified in the United States in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee confirming that (i) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the
United States Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (ii) since the Issue Date, there has been a
change in the applicable United States federal income tax law, in either case, to the effect that,
and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, the beneficial owners of the
outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for United States federal income tax
purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to United States federal income
tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the
case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of
Counsel qualified in the United States in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee confirming that the beneficial owners of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income,
gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant
Defeasance and will be subject to United States federal income tax on the same amounts, in the
same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance
had not occurred;

(4) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit
(other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to
such deposit);

(5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not result in a breach or violation of, or
constitute a default under any material agreement or instrument (other than the Indenture) to
which the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Issuer or any of its
Subsidiaries is bound;

(6) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made
by the Issuer with the intent of preferring the Holders over the other creditors of the Issuer with the
intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors of the Issuer or others;

(7) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, each stating that all conditions precedent
relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance have been complied with; and

(8) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee all other documents or other information that the Trustee may
require in connection with either defeasance option.

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Except as provided in the next three succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture, the Notes or the
Guarantees may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes), and any existing Default,
an Event of Default or its consequences or compliance with any provision thereof may be waived with
the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (including,
without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer
for, Notes).

Unless consented to by Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or

155


-----

tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) without the consent of each Holder affected, an amendment
or waiver may not (with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder):

(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement
or waiver;

(2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any Note;

(3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any Note;

(4) reduce the premium or amount payable upon the redemption of any Note or change the time at
which any Note may be redeemed as described under “Optional Redemption” or “Redemption for
_Taxation Reasons”;_

(5) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, or interest, premium or
Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the
Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes and a waiver of the
payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

(6) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Notes;

(7) amend the contractual right of any Holder to bring suit for the payment of principal, premium, if
any, and interest on its Note, on or after the respective due dates expressed or provided for in
such Note;

(8) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note (other than a payment required by one of
the covenants described under “Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control”);

(9) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture described under “Withholding Taxes” that
adversely affects the rights of any Holder or amends the terms of the Notes in a way that would
result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an exemption from
any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder unless the Payor agrees to
pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof; or

(10) make any change in the preceding amendment and waiver provisions.

Without the consent of the Holders of at least 66 2/3% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes
then outstanding, an amendment or waiver may not (with respect to any Notes held by a
non-consenting Holder) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Guarantee or the
Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.

Notwithstanding the preceding, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Guarantors and
the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture, the Notes or the Guarantees:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes; provided that
such uncertificated Notes are properly treated as in registered form for US federal income tax
purposes;

(3) to comply with the covenant relating to mergers, amalgamations, consolidations and sales of
assets;

(4) to provide for the assumption of the Issuer’s or a Guarantor’s obligations to Holders;

(5) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders or that does
not adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any Holder in any material respect;

(6) to add covenants for the benefit of the Holders or to surrender any right or power conferred upon
the Issuer or any Guarantor;

(7) to allow any Guarantor to execute a supplemental indenture and/or a Guarantee with respect to
the Notes and be added as Guarantor under the Indenture;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment of a successor Trustee or Paying
Agent under the Indenture;

156


-----

(9) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Notes or any Guarantees to any provision of this
Description of the Notes to the extent such provision in this Description of the Notes was intended
to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Notes or any Guarantees;

(10) to provide for the release or addition of Guarantees in accordance with the terms of the Indenture;

(11) to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the terms set forth in the
Indenture; or

(12) to the extent necessary to provide for the granting of a Lien to secure the Notes and/or any
Guarantee as contemplated under “Certain Covenants—Negative Pledge.”

In formulating its decision on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and rely
absolutely on such evidence as it deems necessary, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of
Counsel.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the paragraph above, in order to effect an amendment
authorized by clause (7) above, it shall only be necessary for the supplemental indenture to be duly
authorized and executed by the Issuer, such additional Guarantor and the Trustee. Any other
amendments permitted by the Indenture need only be duly authorized and executed by the Issuer and
the Trustee.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes issued
thereunder, when:

(1) either:

(a) all Notes that have been authenticated (except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes that have been
replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust
and thereafter repaid to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

(b) all Notes that have not been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and
payable by reason of the making of a notice of redemption or otherwise or will become due
and payable at their stated maturity within one year or are to be called for redemption within
one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption
by the Paying Agent or Registrar, and the Issuer has irrevocably deposited or caused to be
deposited with the Trustee (or such other entity designated or appointed (as agent) by it for
this purpose) in trust for the benefit of the Holders of Notes, cash in euro, European
Government Obligations or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient
without consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to pay and discharge the entire
Indebtedness on the Notes not delivered to the Trustee or the Registrar for cancellation for
principal, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest to the
date of maturity or redemption;

(2) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit
or shall occur as a result of such deposit;

(3) the Issuer and/or a Guarantor has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it under the
Indenture; and

(4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the
deposited money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or the redemption date, as the case
may be.

In addition, the Issuer must deliver an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the
Trustee in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee stating that all conditions precedent to
satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied. If requested by the Issuer, the Trustee shall distribute
any amounts deposited in trust to the Holders prior to maturity or the redemption date, as the case may
be; provided that the Holders shall have received at least five Business Days’ notice from the Issuer of
such earlier payment date (which shall be included in a notice of redemption); provided further that, for

157


-----

the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall not distribute such amounts deposited in trust to Holders prior
to the fifth Business Day following the date of publication of any such redemption notice, to the extent
applicable. The Trustee shall not be liable to any Person (including, without limitation, any Holder) for
making any payments at the request of the Issuer and the indemnities from the Issuer and/or
Guarantors contained in the Indentures shall extend to any actions of the Trustee taken, and any
losses and liabilities incurred by the Trustee (including, without limitation, any claims that may be
brought by Holders), in connection with such request.

**Concerning the Trustee**

The Trustee, the Paying Agent or any other such agent in its individual or any other capacity, may
become the owner or pledgee of Notes, may make loans to, accept deposits from, and perform
services for the Issuer or any of its Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Issuer with the same
rights it would have if it were not Trustee, any Paying Agent or any other such agent. The Trustee, any
Paying Agent or any other such agent will be permitted to engage in other transactions. However, if it
acquires any conflicting interest of which it has actual knowledge it must eliminate such conflict within
90 days or resign.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes will have the right to
direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to
the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture provides that in case an Event of Default shall
occur and be continuing of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice in
accordance with the Indenture, the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the
same degree of care and skill a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the
conduct of his or her own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the Trustee will be under no obligation to
exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any Holder of Notes, unless
the conditions enumerated in “Events of Default and Remedies,” above, are met. The permissive rights
of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be
construed as an obligation or duty.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability,
Taxes or expenses incurred without negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Listing**

Application has been made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
and to admit the Notes to trading on the Global Exchange Market thereof. Deutsche Bank Luxembourg
S.A. will initially act as the listing agent for the Notes.

**Additional Information**

Anyone who receives this Offering Memorandum may obtain a copy of the Indenture without
charge by contacting us through our investor relations website (www.intertrustgroup.com/investors).
Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture contains provisions for the indemnification of each of the
Trustee, the Paying Agent and any Registrar, co-Registrar, authenticating agent or Transfer Agent in
connection with their respective actions taken under the Indenture.

**Notices**

In the case of certificated Notes, all notices to Holders will be validly given if mailed to them at their
respective addresses in the register of the Holders of such Notes, if any, maintained by the Registrar.
And, so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and
admitted for trading on the Global Exchange Market and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
so require, all notices will be published in a newspaper having a general circulation in Luxembourg
(which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such
rules, posted on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu). Each such
notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication, or, if published more than

158


-----

once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are
mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of publication and the seventh
day after being so mailed. For so long as any Notes are represented by global Notes, all notices to
Holders will be delivered to Euroclear and Clearstream, each of which will give notice of such notice to
the holders of beneficial interests in the Notes. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall
be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to
such Person if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to mail a notice or communication to a
Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or
communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee
receives it.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of principal or Additional Amounts, if
any, on the Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof.
Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed
five years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro Denominated Restrictions**

The euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the
Guarantors under or in connection with the Notes and the Guarantees, including damages. Any
amount received or recovered in a currency other than euro, whether as a result of, or the enforcement
of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any
Guarantor or otherwise, by any Holder or by the Trustee, as the case may be, in respect of any sum
expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or
the Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the euro amount which the recipient is able to purchase
with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery
(or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable
to do so).

If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient under any
Note, any Guarantee or to the Trustee, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them on a joint
and several basis against any loss sustained by such recipient as a result. In any event, the Issuer and
the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient on a joint and several basis against the cost of making any
such purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be sufficient for the Holder
of a Note or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the
sources of information used) the loss it incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities
constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other
obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any
indulgence granted by any Holder of a Note or the Trustee and will continue in full force and effect
despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due
under any Note, any Guarantee or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any
euro-denominated restriction herein, the euro-denominated-equivalent amount for purposes hereof that
is denominated in a non-euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange
rate in effect on the date such non-euro amount is incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since a substantial portion of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors incorporated in non-US
jurisdictions are outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the
Issuer or any non-US Guarantor, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal,
premium, interest, Additional Amounts and any redemption price and any purchase price with respect
to the Notes or the Guarantees, may not be collectable within the United States.

159


-----

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture, the
Notes and the Guarantees, the Issuer and each Guarantor will in the Indenture irrevocably submit to
the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York,
County and State of New York, United States of America.

**Governing Law**

Each of the Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees and the rights and duties of the parties
thereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

this definition, “control,” as used with respect to any Person, shall mean the possession, directly or
indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management or policies of such Person,
whether through the ownership of voting securities, by agreement or otherwise. For purposes of this
definition, the terms “controlling,” “controlled by” and “under common control with” shall have
correlative meanings.

such Note through, 2021 (excluding accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption date),
computed using a discount rate equal to the Bund Rate as of the date of such redemption notice
plus 50 basis points (subject to a 0.0% floor) over (b) the then outstanding principal amount of
such Note,

in each case, as calculated by the Issuer or on behalf of the Issuer by such Person as the Issuer shall
designate. Calculation or verification of the Applicable Premium shall not be an obligation or duty of the
Trustee, any Paying Agents, the Registrar or the Transfer Agent.

“Beneficial Owner” has the meaning assigned to such term in Rule 13d-3 and Rule 13d-5 under
the Exchange Act, except that in calculating the beneficial ownership of any particular “person” (as that
term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), such “person” shall be deemed to have
beneficial ownership of all securities that such “person” has the right to acquire by conversion or
exercise of other securities, whether such right is currently exercisable or is exercisable only upon the

_Bundesanleihen) with a constant maturity (as officially compiled and published in the most recent_
financial statistics that has become publicly available at least two Business Days (but not more than

**BOOK-ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM**

**GENERAL**

The Notes sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A will initially be represented
by a global note in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Rule 144A Global Notes”).
The Notes sold to non-US persons outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S will initially be
represented by a global note in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S
**Global Notes” and, together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The Global Notes**
will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common depositary and registered in the name of the
nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the “Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests”)
and ownership of interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry
**Interests” and, together with the Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be**
limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that hold interests
through such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf
of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of
their respective depositories. Except under the limited circumstances described below, Book-Entry
Interests will not be issued in definitive form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records
maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The Book-Entry
Interests in Global Notes will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the
United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of those
securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge
Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will
not be considered the registered owners or “holders” of Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary for Euroclear and/or
Clearstream (or its nominee), as applicable, will be considered the sole holder of the Global Notes for
all purposes under the Indenture. In addition, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and
the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise
any rights of holders of Notes under the Indenture.

None of the Parent Guarantor, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar or the
Transfer Agent or any of their respective affiliates will have any responsibility, or be liable, for any
aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**REDEMPTION OF THE GLOBAL NOTES**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global
Note from the amount received by them in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The
redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal
to the amount received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption
of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). We understand that, under the existing practices of
Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear
and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with
adjustments to prevent fractions) or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate unless
otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or depositary requirements, provided,
however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000 principal amount may be redeemed in part.

**PAYMENTS ON GLOBAL NOTES**

We will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal,
premium, interest and additional amounts, if any) to the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent will, in turn,

176


-----

make such payments to the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream, which
will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their respective customary procedures.
All payments required to be made by us with respect to the Notes will be made free and clear of, and
without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments
or governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by law and as described
under “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes.” If any such deduction or withholding is required
to be made, then, to the extent described under “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes” above,
as the case may be, we will pay additional amounts as may be necessary in order for the net amounts
received by any holder of the Global Notes or owner of Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or
withholding to equal the net amounts that such holder or owner would have otherwise received in
respect of such Global Note or Book-Entry Interest, as the case may be, absent such withholding or
deduction. We expect that standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern
payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar, the
Transfer Agent and the relevant agents will treat the registered holders of the Global Notes (i.e., the
common depositary for Euroclear or Clearstream (or their respective nominees)) as the owner thereof
for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the
Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent or any of their respective agents has or
will have any responsibility or liability for:

    - any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear or Clearstream or any participant or indirect
participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

    - Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant; or

    - the records of the common depositary.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the
responsibility of such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of
subscribers registered in “street name.”

**CURRENCY OF PAYMENT FOR THE GLOBAL NOTES**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the
Global Notes, will be paid to holders of Book-Entry Interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or
Clearstream in euro.

**ACTION BY OWNERS OF BOOK-ENTRY INTERESTS**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken by
a holder of a Note (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described above) only at the
direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are
credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which
such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not
exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect
of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the Notes, each of Euroclear and
Clearstream, at the request of the holders of such Notes, reserve the right to require the Issuer to
exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes in certificated form, and to distribute such
Definitive Registered Notes to their participants.

**TRANSFERS**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and/or Clearstream will be effected in accordance with
Euroclear and Clearstream’s rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder of a
Note requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes to
persons in states that require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such

177


-----

holder of Notes must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the procedures to be set forth in the
Indenture.

The Global Notes will each bear a legend to the effect set forth under “Transfer Restrictions.”
Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification
requirements discussed under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Transfers of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interests will at all times be subject to such transfer restrictions.

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the
form to be provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with
Regulation S or Rule 144A or any other exemption (if available under the US Securities Act).

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form
of a Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the
form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the
transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a
transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer
restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable securities
laws of any other jurisdiction.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a
Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the
principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount
of the Rule 144A Global Note.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a
Global Note only as described below as the case may be and, if required, only if the transferor first
delivers to the Registrar a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that
such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See
“Transfer Restrictions.”

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes
delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a
Book-Entry Interest in the first-mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in the other
Global Note, and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other
procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such
a Book-Entry Interest.

**DEFINITIVE REGISTERED NOTES**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive
Registered Notes:

(1) if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary
and a successor depositary is not appointed by us within 120 days; or

(2) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through
Euroclear or Clearstream following an event of default under the Indenture and enforcement action
is being taken in respect thereof under the Indenture.

In such an event, the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or
names of the holder(s) and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of
Euroclear and/or Clearstream or us (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and
based upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry
Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the
Indenture, unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable law.

178


-----

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the Paying Agent and
the Registrar shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner
thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global
Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time at our registered office, and such
registration is a means of evidencing title to the Notes.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the
Book-Entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of
accounts in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable.

**INFORMATION CONCERNING EUROCLEAR AND CLEARSTREAM**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable. We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures
solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of the settlement system are
controlled by the settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither we nor the Trustee, the
Paying Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent or any of the Initial Purchasers are responsible for
those operations or procedures.

We understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream

banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream
is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or
maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or
indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can act only on behalf of participants, who in turn act on
behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge
such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear and/or Clearstream systems,
or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate
for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of
securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons
may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream
systems will receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or
Clearstream participants.

**GLOBAL CLEARANCE AND SETTLEMENT UNDER THE BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange. Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in
Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective
system’s rules and operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case
may be, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such
procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the
Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or the Paying Agent will have any responsibility for the
performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants of their respective
obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**INITIAL SETTLEMENT**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear
or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional eurobonds in

179


-----

registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear
and Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value
on the settlement date.

**SECONDARY MARKET TRADING**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle
in same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at
the time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts
are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

**TAXATION IN THE NETHERLANDS**

The information set out below is a general summary of certain material Dutch tax consequences in
connection with the acquisition, ownership and transfer of the Notes. This summary is not a
comprehensive or complete description of all the Dutch tax considerations that may be relevant for a
particular holder of Notes and it does not address the tax consequences that may arise in any
jurisdiction other than the Netherlands in connection with the acquisition, ownership and transfer of the
Notes. For Dutch tax purposes, a holder of Notes may include an individual who or an entity that does
not have the legal title to the Notes, but to whom nevertheless the Notes, or the income thereof, are
attributed based either on such individual or entity holding a beneficial interest in the Notes or based on
specific statutory provisions.

This summary is based on the tax laws of the Netherlands as in effect on the date of this Offering
Memorandum, including regulations, rulings and decisions of the Netherlands and its taxing and other
authorities available in printed form on or before this date and now in effect, and as applied and
interpreted by Dutch courts, without prejudice to any developments or amendments introduced at a
later date and implemented with or without retroactive effect.

Any reference in this summary to the Netherlands and to Netherlands or Dutch tax law are to the
European part of the Netherlands and its law, respectively, only.

As this summary is intended as general information only, holders of Notes should consult their
own tax advisors as to the Dutch or other tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and transfer
of Notes, including, in particular, the application to their particular situations of the tax considerations
discussed below. Holders of Notes may be subject to a special tax treatment under any applicable law
and this summary is not intended to be applicable in respect of all categories of holders of Notes.

**_Withholding Tax_**

Any payments of interest and principal to be made by the Issuer under the Notes may be made
free of withholding or deduction of any taxes of whatsoever nature imposed, levied, withheld or
assessed by the Netherlands or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein.

For developments and risks in relation to the application of the proposed withholding tax on
interest payments see “Risk Factors—The introduction of a Dutch conditional withholding tax on
_interest payments may increase the amounts that we are obliged to pay under the Notes.”_

**_Taxes on Income and Capital Gains_**

This summary is not intended for any holder of Notes:

    - who is an individual and for whom the income or capital gains derived from the Notes are
attributable to employment activities, the income from which is taxable in the Netherlands;

    - who has, or that has, a Substantial Interest (as defined below) or a deemed Substantial
Interest in the Issuer;

    - that is an entity that is resident or deemed to be resident in the Netherlands and that is, in
whole or in part, not subject to or exempt from Dutch corporate income tax (such as qualifying
pension funds);

    - that is an exempt investment institution (vrijgestelde beleggingsinstelling) or a fiscal
investment institution (fiscale beleggingsinstelling) as meant in Articles 6a and 28 of the
Netherlands Corporate Income Tax Act 1969 (Wet op de vennootschapsbelasting 1969,
“CITA”), respectively; or

    - who is, or that is, not considered the beneficial owner (uiteindelijk gerechtigde) of the Notes
and/or the income and/or capital gains derived from the Notes.

181


-----

Generally a holder of Notes will have a substantial interest (aanmerkelijk belang) in the Issuer if he
holds, alone or, in case the holder is an individual, together with his partner (statutorily defined term in
Dutch tax law), whether directly or indirectly, the ownership of, or certain other rights over, shares
representing 5% or more of the total issued and outstanding capital (or the issued and outstanding
capital of any class of shares) of the Issuer, or rights to acquire shares, whether or not already issued,
that represent at any time 5% or more of the total issued and outstanding capital (or the issued and
outstanding capital of any class of shares) of the Issuer, or the ownership of certain profit participating
certificates that relate to 5% or more of the annual profit or to 5% or more of the liquidation proceeds of
the Issuer (a “Substantial Interest”).

A holder of Notes will also have a Substantial Interest in the Issuer if one of certain relatives of that
holder or of his partner has a Substantial Interest in the Issuer. If a holder of Notes does not have a
Substantial Interest, a deemed Substantial Interest will be present if (part of) a Substantial Interest has
been disposed of, or is deemed to have been disposed of, without recognizing a taxable gain.

_Dutch Resident Individuals_

A holder of Notes who is an individual and who is resident or deemed to be resident in the
Netherlands for purposes of Dutch taxation (a “Dutch Resident Individual”), will generally be subject
to Dutch income tax with respect to income and capital gains derived or deemed to be derived from the
Notes at the progressive rates up to 51.95% (maximum rate for 2018) if:

(i) the holder derives profits from an enterprise or deemed enterprise, whether as an entrepreneur
(ondernemer) or pursuant to a co-entitlement to the net worth of such enterprise (other than as an
entrepreneur or a shareholder), to which enterprise the Notes are attributable or deemed to be
attributable; or

(ii) the holder derives income or capital gains from the Notes, as the case may be, that are taxable as
benefits from miscellaneous activities (resultaat uit overige werkzaamheden, as defined in the
Netherlands Income Tax Act 2001 (Wet _inkomstenbelasting_ _2001)),_ which include the
performance of activities with respect to the Notes, that exceed regular, active portfolio
management (normaal, actief vermogensbeheer) and also include benefits resulting from a
lucrative interest (lucratief belang).

If neither condition (i) nor condition (ii) mentioned above applies, a Dutch Resident Individual will
generally be subject to Dutch income tax on a deemed return, regardless of the actual income or
capital gains derived from the Notes. This deemed return is calculated by applying the applicable
deemed return percentage(s) to the individual’s yield basis (rendementsgrondslag), insofar this
exceeds a certain threshold (heffingvrij vermogen). The individual’s yield basis is determined as the fair
market value of certain qualifying assets (including, as the case may be, the Notes) held by the Dutch
Resident Individual less the fair market value of certain qualifying liabilities, both determined on
January 1 of the relevant year. The deemed return percentages to be applied to the yield basis
increases progressively from 2.02% to 5.38% (rates for 2018), depending on such individual’s yield
basis. The deemed return percentages will be adjusted annually. The deemed return will be taxed at a
rate of 30% (rate for 2018).

_Dutch Resident Entities_

A holder of Notes that is an entity and that is resident or deemed to be resident in the Netherlands
for purposes of Dutch taxation (a “Dutch Resident Entity”), will generally be subject to Dutch
corporate income tax with respect to income and capital gains derived or deemed to be derived from
the Notes. The Dutch corporate income tax rate is 20% for the first €200,000 of taxable profits and
25% for the taxable amount exceeding €200,000 (rates for 2018).

182


-----

_Non-Dutch Residents_

A holder of Notes who is not, nor deemed to be, a Dutch Resident Individual or a Dutch Resident
Entity (a “Non-Dutch Resident”), is generally not subject to Dutch income tax or Dutch corporate
income tax with respect to income and capital gains derived from the Notes, provided that:

    - such Non-Dutch Resident does not derive profits from an enterprise or deemed enterprise,
whether as an entrepreneur or pursuant to a co-entitlement to the net worth of such enterprise
(other than as an entrepreneur or a shareholder) which enterprise is, in whole or in part,
carried on through a permanent establishment (vaste _inrichting)_ or a permanent
representative (vaste vertegenwoordiger) in the Netherlands and to which enterprise or part of
an enterprise, as the case may be, the Notes are attributable or deemed attributable;

    - in case of a Non-Dutch Resident who is an individual, such individual does not derive income
or capital gains from the Notes, as the case may be, that are taxable as benefits from
miscellaneous activities performed in the Netherlands, which include the performance of
activities in respect of the Notes, that exceed regular, active portfolio management and also
includes benefits resulting from a lucrative interest;

    - in case of a Non-Dutch Resident who is an individual, such individual is not entitled to a share
in the profits of an enterprise effectively managed in the Netherlands, other than by way of the
holding of securities or through an employment relationship, to which enterprise the Notes or
payments in respect of the Notes are attributable; and

    - in case of a Non-Dutch Resident that is an entity, such entity is neither entitled to a share in
the profits of an enterprise nor co-entitled to the net worth of an enterprise effectively
managed in the Netherlands, other than by way of the holding of securities, to which
enterprise the Notes or payments in respect of the Notes are attributable.

**_Gift and Inheritance Taxes_**

_Dutch Residents_

Generally, gift taxes (schenkbelasting) and inheritance taxes (erfbelasting) may arise in the
Netherlands with respect to a transfer of the Notes by way of a gift by, or on the death of, a holder of
Notes who is resident or deemed to be resident in the Netherlands for the purpose of the Netherlands
Gift and Inheritance Tax Act 1956 (Successiewet 1965) at the time of the gift or his/her death.

_Non-Dutch Residents_

No Dutch gift or inheritance taxes will be levied on the transfer of Notes by way of gift by, or on the
death of, a holder who is neither resident nor deemed to be resident in the Netherlands for the purpose
of the relevant provisions, unless:

(i) the transfer is construed as an inheritance or bequest, or as a gift made by or on behalf of a
person who, at the time of the gift or death, is or is deemed to be resident in the Netherlands for
the purpose of the relevant provisions;

(ii) such holder dies while being resident or deemed resident in the Netherlands within 180 days after
the date of a gift of the Notes; or

(iii) the gift is made under a condition precedent and such holder is or is deemed to be resident in the
Netherlands at the time the condition is fulfilled.

For purposes of the Netherlands Gift and Inheritance Tax Act 1956, an individual who is of the
Dutch nationality will be deemed to be resident in the Netherlands if he has been resident in the
Netherlands at any time during the ten years preceding the date of the gift or his death. For purposes
of Dutch gift tax, an individual will, irrespective of his nationality, be deemed to be resident in the
Netherlands if he has been resident in the Netherlands at any time during the twelve months preceding
the date of the gift. The same twelve-month rule may apply to entities that have transferred their seat
of residence out of the Netherlands. Applicable tax treaties concluded by the Netherlands may override
such deemed residency.

183


-----

**_Value Added Tax_**

No Dutch value added tax (omzetbelasting) is payable by a holder of Notes in respect of the
purchase of the Notes pursuant to this offering (other than value added tax due on fees payable in
respect of additional services not exempt from Dutch value added tax).

**_Other Taxes and Duties_**

No Dutch registration tax, capital tax, customs duty, stamp duty or any other similar tax or duty,
other than court fees, will be payable in the Netherlands by a holder of Notes in respect of or in
connection with the acquisition, ownership or transfer of the Notes.

**_Residence_**

A holder of Notes will not become or be deemed to become resident in the Netherlands for tax
purposes solely by reason of the acquisition, ownership or transfer of the Notes.

**CERTAIN US FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences of the
purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes. This summary deals only with Notes held as capital
assets (within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
“Code”)) by US holders (as defined below) who purchase the Notes for cash pursuant to the Offering
at their “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes of the applicable series
is sold for money to investors, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or
organizations acting in the capacity of underwriter, placement agent or wholesaler).

As used herein, a “US holder” means a beneficial owner of the Notes that is, for United States
federal income tax purposes, any of the following:

    - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

    - a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax
purposes) that is created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state
thereof or the District of Columbia;

    - an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless
of its source; or

    - a trust if it (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one
or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the
trust or (ii) has a valid election in effect under applicable United States Treasury regulations to
be treated as a United States person.

If any entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for United States federal income tax
purposes holds Notes, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the
partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partnership or a partner in a partnership
considering an investment in the Notes, you should consult your own tax advisors.

This summary does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income tax
consequences applicable to you if you are a person subject to special tax treatment under the United
States federal income tax laws, including, without limitation:

    - a dealer in securities or currencies;

    - a financial institution;

    - a regulated investment company;

    - a real estate investment trust;

    - a tax-exempt organization;

    - an insurance company;

184


-----

    - a person holding the Notes as part of a hedging, integrated, conversion or constructive sale
transaction or a straddle;

    - a trader in securities that has elected the mark-to-market method of accounting for your
securities;

    - a person liable for alternative minimum tax;

    - a partnership or other pass-through entity (or an investor in such an entity);

    - a person whose “functional currency” is not the US dollar;

    - a person required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to the
Notes as a result of such income being recognized on an applicable financial statement; or

    - a United States expatriate.

This summary is based on the Code, United States Treasury regulations, administrative rulings
and judicial decisions as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed, possibly on a
retroactive basis, so as to result in United States federal income tax consequences different from those
summarized below. We have not and will not seek any rulings from the Internal Revenue Service
(“IRS”) regarding the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take
positions concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes that
are different from those discussed below.

This summary does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income tax
consequences to you in light of your particular circumstances and does not address the Medicare
contribution tax on net investment income or the effects of any state, local or non-United States tax
laws. It is not intended to be, and should not be construed to be, legal or tax advice to any particular
purchaser of Notes.

**If you are considering the purchase of Notes, you should consult your own tax advisors**
**concerning the particular United States federal income tax consequences to you of the**
**purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes, as well as the consequences to you arising**
**under other United States federal tax laws and the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.**

**_Payments of interest_**

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, interest on a Note will generally be taxable
to you as ordinary income at the time it is paid or accrued in accordance with your method of
accounting for United States federal income tax purposes. Interest income on a Note will generally be
considered foreign source income and, for purposes of the United States foreign tax credit, will
generally be considered passive category income. You will generally be denied a foreign tax credit for
foreign taxes imposed with respect to the Notes where you do not meet a minimum holding period
requirement during which you are not protected from risk of loss. The rules governing the foreign tax
credit are complex. You are urged to consult your tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign
tax credit under your particular circumstances.

Interest on the Notes will be payable in euro. If you use the cash basis method of accounting for
United States federal income tax purposes, you will be required to include in income (as ordinary
income) the US dollar value of the amount of interest received on the Notes, determined by translating
the amount of euro received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received, regardless of
whether the payment is in fact converted into US dollars. You will not recognize exchange gain or loss
with respect to the receipt of such payment (other than exchange gain or loss realized on the
disposition of the euro so received).

If you use the accrual method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, you
may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to interest on the Notes in accordance
with either of two methods. Under the first method you will be required to include in income (as
ordinary income) for each taxable year the US dollar value of the interest that has accrued on the
Notes held during such year, determined by translating such interest at the average rate of exchange

185


-----

for the period or periods (or portions thereof) during which such interest accrued. Under the second
method, you may translate interest income at the spot rate on:

    - the last day of the accrual period;

    - the last day of the taxable year if the accrual period straddles your taxable year; or

    - the date the interest payment is received if such date is within five business days of the end of
the accrual period.

If you elect to use the second method, the election must be consistently applied by you to all debt
instruments from year to year and can be changed only with the consent of the IRS. In addition, if you
use the accrual method of accounting, upon receipt of an interest payment on a Note (including, upon
the sale of a Note, the receipt of proceeds which include amounts attributable to accrued interest
previously included in income), you will recognize ordinary gain or loss in an amount equal to the
difference between the US dollar value of such payment (determined by translating the amount of euro
received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received) and the US dollar value of the interest
income you previously included in income with respect to such payment.

**_Sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, you
generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized upon the sale,
exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition (less any amount attributable to accrued
and unpaid interest, which will be taxable as interest income as discussed above under “—Payments
_of interest”) and the adjusted tax basis of the Note. Your adjusted tax basis in a Note will generally be_
your cost for that Note. If you purchased a Note with euro, your cost generally will be the US dollar
value of the amount of foreign currency paid for such Note determined at the spot rate on the date of
such purchase (or, in the case of a cash basis or electing accrual basis taxpayer, the settlement date
of the purchase, if the Note is treated as traded on an established securities market for US federal
income tax purposes). If your Note is sold, exchanged, retired or otherwise disposed of in a taxable
transaction for euro, then your amount realized generally will be based on the spot rate in effect on the
date of such sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition (or, in the case of a cash basis or
electing accrual basis taxpayer, the settlement date of the sale, exchange, retirement or disposition, if
the Note is treated as traded on an established securities market for US federal income tax purposes).
If you use the accrual method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, you may
elect the same treatment with respect to the purchase and sale of Notes traded on an established
securities market, provided that such election is applied consistently to all debt instruments held by you
from year to year. Such election cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS.

Except with respect to gain or loss attributable to changes in exchange rates as discussed below,
any gain or loss you recognize will generally be capital gain or loss and will generally be long-term
capital gain or loss if you have held the Note for more than one year. Long-term capital gains of
non-corporate US holders (including individuals) are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Any gain or loss you recognize will generally be
treated as United States source gain or loss.

A portion of your gain or loss with respect to the principal amount of a Note may be treated as
exchange gain or loss. Exchange gain or loss will generally be treated as United States source
ordinary income or loss. For these purposes, the principal amount of the Note is your purchase price
for the Note calculated in euro on the date of purchase, and the amount of exchange gain or loss
recognized is equal to the difference between (i) the US dollar value of the principal amount
determined at the spot rate on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of
the Note and (ii) the US dollar value of the principal amount determined at the spot rate on the date
you purchased the Note (or, possibly, in the case of cash basis or electing accrual basis taxpayers, the
settlement dates of such purchase and taxable disposition, if the Note is treated as traded on an
established securities market for US federal income tax purposes). The amount of exchange gain or
loss recognized on the disposition of the Note (with respect to both principal and accrued interest) will
be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss realized on the disposition of the Note.

186


-----

**_Disposition of foreign currency_**

Your tax basis in euro received as interest on a Note or on the sale, exchange, retirement or other
taxable disposition of a Note will be the US dollar value thereof at the spot rate in effect on the date the
euro are received. Any gain or loss recognized by you on a sale, exchange or other disposition of the
euro will generally be treated as US source ordinary income or loss.

**_Reportable transactions_**

United States Treasury regulations issued under the Code meant to require the reporting of certain
tax shelter transactions could be interpreted to cover transactions generally not regarded as tax
shelters, including certain foreign currency transactions. Under the United States Treasury regulations,
certain transactions are required to be reported to the IRS, including, in certain circumstances, a sale,
exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a foreign currency note or foreign currency
received in respect of a foreign currency note to the extent that such sale, exchange, retirement or
other taxable disposition results in a tax loss in excess of a threshold amount. If you are considering
the purchase of a Note, you should consult with your own tax advisors to determine the tax return
obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Notes, including any requirement to file IRS
Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).

**_Backup withholding and information reporting_**

Generally, information reporting will apply to all payments of interest and principal on a Note and
the proceeds from a sale or other disposition of a Note paid to you, unless you are an exempt recipient.
Additionally, if you fail to provide your taxpayer identification number, or in the case of interest
payments, fail either to report in full dividend and interest income or to make certain certifications, you
may be subject to backup withholding on any such payments or proceeds.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup
withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against your United States federal income tax
liability provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND CERTAIN**
**INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS**

_Set out below is a summary of certain limitations on the enforceability of the Guarantees in each of_
_the jurisdictions in which the Issuer and the Guarantors are organized (other than the United States). It_
_is a summary only, and bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or a similar event could be initiated in_
_any of these jurisdictions and in the jurisdiction of organization of a future guarantor of the Notes. The_
_application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s_
_law should apply and could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights and to collect payment in_
_full under the Notes and the Guarantees. Also set forth below is a brief description of certain aspects of_
_insolvency law in the EU, the Netherlands, the Cayman Islands, Jersey and Guernsey._

**EUROPEAN UNION**

The Issuer and several of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Member States. As
such, they are subject to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council
dated May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (recast) (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), which
entered into force on June 26, 2015, and applies to insolvency proceedings opened on or after
June 26, 2017. It has replaced Council Regulation (EC) no. 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings, as
amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 663/2014 of June 5, 2014 (the “Old EU Insolvency
**Regulation”).**

Pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court which has jurisdiction to open “main
insolvency proceedings” in relation to a company is the court of the Member State (other than
Denmark) where the company concerned has its “centre of main interests” (as that term is used in
Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation). The determination of where any such company has its
“centre of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may
have differing and even conflicting views.

The term “centre of main interests” is not a static concept and may change from time to time.
Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that any
company or legal person has its “centre of main interests” in the Member State in which it has its
registered office, Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the “centre of main interests”
of a debtor shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular
basis and “which is ascertainable by third parties.” In that respect, factors such as where board
meetings are held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its business and the
location where the large majority of the company’s creditors are established may all be relevant in the
determination of the place where the company has its “centre of main interests.”

The point at which a company’s “centre of main interests” is determined is at the time that the
relevant insolvency proceedings are opened. The rebuttable presumption that a company has its
“centre of main interests” in the Member State in which it has its registered office shall only apply if the
registered office has not been moved to another Member State within a three-month period prior to the
request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Specifically, it should be possible to rebut this
presumption if the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its
registered office, and if a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a
manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and
supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. In this
regard, special consideration should be given to creditors and their perception as to where a debtor
conducts the administration of its interests. The EU Insolvency Regulation has thereby basically
implemented the existing case law of the European Court of Justice regarding the assessment of the
place of the company’s “centre of main interests” into the text of the law. It has also, however,
increased the requirements for a shift of the “centre of main interests” shortly prior to the filing for
insolvency. In the event of a shift in the “centre of main interests,” this may require informing the
creditors of the new location from which the debtor is carrying out its activities in due course (for
example, by drawing attention to the change of address in commercial correspondence or otherwise
making the new location public through other appropriate means).

188


-----

Where the “centre of main interests” of a company is located in a Member State (other than
Denmark), the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the EU Insolvency
Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would
be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU
Insolvency Regulation. Main insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the EU
Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized and given effect to (subject to some exceptions) in all the
other Member States (other than Denmark), although “secondary proceedings” may be opened in
another Member State (other than Denmark), in the circumstances described below. If the company
does not have an establishment in any other Member State, no court of any other Member State has
jurisdiction to open secondary proceedings in respect of such company under the EU Insolvency
Regulation.

The courts of a Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open “territorial
proceedings” (before the opening of main insolvency proceedings) or “secondary proceedings” (after
the opening of main insolvency proceedings) only in the event that a debtor has an “establishment” in
the territory of such other Member State (not being the Member State in which such debtor has its
“centre of main interests”). The effects of “territorial proceedings” or “secondary proceedings” shall be
restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of the Member State where such
proceedings are opened. The determination of whether a company has an “establishment” and where
it is situated is also a question of fact and is not a static concept. As such, an establishment could be
created and may change from time to time. According to Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation,
an “establishment” means any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the
three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory
economic activity with human means and assets. A “place of operations” is likely to be construed as a
place from which economic activities are conducted on the market using human resources which
requires a minimum level of organization so that a purely occasional place of operations is unlikely to
be classified as an “establishment,” rather a certain level of stability of such operations is necessary. In
its judgment dated October 20, 2011 (“Interedil”), rendered under the Old EU Insolvency Regulation,
the European Court of Justice confirmed that the creation of an “establishment” within the meaning of
the Old EU Insolvency Regulation requires the existence of a structure which is designated for the
performance of business activities with a minimum level of organization and a certain degree of
stability.

In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, any of its subsidiaries or a Guarantor experience
financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions
insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings.
Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations of, and the security granted
by, the Issuer, any of its subsidiaries and/or any Guarantor. The insolvency and other laws of the
jurisdictions in which the respective companies are organized or operate may be materially different
from, or (subject to the framework provided for under the EU Insolvency Regulation) conflict with, each
other and there is no assurance as to how the insolvency laws of the potentially involved jurisdictions
will be applied in relation to one another.

On June 23, 2016, the UK held a referendum to decide on the UK’s membership of the EU. The
UK vote was to leave the EU. The terms on which the UK will exit the EU are not certain and therefore
it is not possible to know what impact any exit by the UK of the EU will have on the application of the
EU Insolvency Regulation to any insolvency proceedings (including, without limitation, the
commencement of such insolvency proceedings and the jurisdiction of the UK courts to open such
insolvency proceedings) to which the Issuer or any Guarantor may be subject.

**THE NETHERLANDS**

**_Insolvency_**

Subject to the limitations described under “—European Union,” where a company (incorporated in
the Netherlands or elsewhere) has its “centre of main interests” or an “establishment” in the
Netherlands, it may be subjected to Dutch insolvency proceedings. This is particularly relevant for the
Issuer and certain of the Guarantors, which have their corporate seats (statutaire zetel) in the

189


-----

Netherlands, and are therefore each presumed (subject to proof to the contrary) to have their “centre of
main interests” in the Netherlands.

Dutch insolvency law differs significantly from insolvency proceedings in the US and other
jurisdictions, and may make it more difficult for holders of Notes to recover the amount they would
normally expect to recover in a liquidation or bankruptcy proceeding in the US or another jurisdiction.

There are two primary insolvency regimes under Dutch law applicable to legal entities: the first,
suspension of payments (surseance van betaling), is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a
debtor’s indebtedness and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern. The second, bankruptcy
(faillissement), is primarily designed to liquidate and distribute the proceeds of the assets of a debtor to
its creditors. Both insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act. A general description
of the principles of both insolvency regimes is set forth below.

Unlike Chapter 11 proceedings under US bankruptcy law, in which both secured and unsecured
creditors are generally barred from seeking to exercise remedies against the debtor without court
approval, in suspension of payments and bankruptcy proceedings under Dutch law, secured creditors
(and in case of suspension of payments also preferential creditors (including tax and social security
authorities)) may enforce their rights against assets of the company to satisfy their claims as if there
were no insolvency proceedings. A recovery under Dutch law could, therefore, involve a sale of assets
that does not reflect the going concern value of the debtor. Consequently, your potential recovery could
be reduced in Dutch insolvency proceedings.

Restrictions on the enforcement of security interests may apply. For instance, higher ranking rights
must be respected. These may include secured creditors and tax and social security authorities.
A statutory stay of execution of security rights and other rights of up to two months, extendable by
another period of up to two months, may be imposed. Further, a receiver in bankruptcy can force a
secured creditor to enforce its security interest within a reasonable period of time, failing which the
receiver will be entitled to sell the secured assets, if any, and the secured creditor will have a preferred
claim in respect of the proceeds, meaning that the secured creditor will have to share in the bankruptcy
costs, which may be significant. Also, in this case, the secured creditor will have to wait until the
distribution plan becomes final for payment. Excess proceeds of any enforcement must be returned to
the bankrupt estate; they may not be set-off against an unsecured claim of the secured creditor. Such
set-off may be allowed prior to the bankruptcy, although it may be subject to clawback in the event of a
fraudulent conveyance or bad faith in obtaining the claim used for set-off.

Any pending executions of judgments against the debtor will be suspended by operation of law
when suspension of payments is granted and terminated by operation of law when bankruptcy is
declared. In addition, all attachments on the debtor’s assets will cease to have effect upon the
suspension of payments having become definitive, a composition having been ratified by the court or
the declaration of bankruptcy (as the case may be) subject to the ability of the court to set an earlier
date for such termination. Litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically
stayed.

In a suspension of payments and in bankruptcy, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to
creditors. A composition will be binding on all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is
(i) approved by a simple majority of the creditors being present or represented at the creditors’
meeting, representing at least 50% of the amount of the claims that are admitted for voting purposes,
and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the Dutch courts. Consequently, Dutch insolvency
laws could preclude or inhibit the ability of the holders of the Notes to effect a restructuring and could
reduce the recovery of a holder of Notes.

Claims against a company subject to Dutch insolvency proceedings will have to be verified in the
insolvency proceedings in order to be entitled to vote and, in a bankruptcy liquidation, to be entitled to
distributions. “Verification” under Dutch law means, in the case of a suspension of payments, that the
treatment of a disputed claim for voting purposes is determined and, in the case of a bankruptcy, that
the value of the claim is determined and whether and to what extent it will be admitted in the insolvency
proceedings. The valuation of claims that would not otherwise have been payable at the time of the

190


-----

proceedings may be based on a net present value analysis. Unless secured by a pledge or a
mortgage, interest accruing after the date on which insolvency proceedings are opened cannot be
verified. Where interest is accruing after the date of opening of the proceedings, it can be admitted
_pro memoria._

The existence, value and ranking of any claims submitted by the holders of the Notes may be
challenged in the Dutch insolvency proceedings. Generally, in a creditors’ meeting
(verificatievergadering), the receiver in bankruptcy, the administrator in suspension of payment
proceedings, the insolvent debtor and all verified creditors may dispute the verification of claims of
other creditors. Creditors whose claims or value thereof are disputed in the creditors meeting may be
referred to separate court proceedings (renvooiprocedure) in bankruptcy, while in suspension of
payments the court will decide how a disputed claim will be treated for voting purposes. These
situations could cause holders of Notes to recover less than the principal amount of their Notes.
_Renvooiprocedures could also cause payments to the holders of Notes to be delayed compared to_
holders of undisputed claims.

The Dutch Bankruptcy Act does not in itself recognize the concept of classes of creditors.
Remaining amounts, if any, after satisfaction of the secured and the preferential creditors are
distributed among the unsecured non-preferential creditors, who will be satisfied on a pro rata basis.
Contractual subordination will generally be given effect in Dutch insolvency proceedings, with the
actual effect largely depending on the way such subordination is construed.

**_Fraudulent transfer / conveyance_**

Under Dutch law, a legal act performed by a person (including, without limitation, an agreement
pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third-party or agrees to provide
or provides security for any of its or a third-party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements
benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having a similar effect) can be challenged in an
insolvency proceeding or otherwise and may be nullified by any of its creditors or its receiver in
bankruptcy, if (a) it performed such act without an obligation to do so (onverplicht), (b) the creditor
concerned or, in the case of its bankruptcy, any creditor was prejudiced as a consequence of the act,
and (c) at the time the act was performed both it and (unless the act was for no consideration
(om niet)) the party with or towards which it acted, knew or should have known that one or more of its
creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced (actio pauliana). In the case of a bankruptcy, the
beneficiary of the guarantee or security interest is presumed (subject to evidence to the contrary) to
have known that creditors of the debtor would be prejudiced if the bankruptcy follows within a year of
the granting and for no consideration. In addition, the bankruptcy receiver may challenge the guarantee
or security interest if it was granted on the basis of a prior existing legal obligation to do so (verplichte
_rechtshandeling), if (i) the guarantee or security interest was granted at a time that the beneficiary of_
such guarantee or security interest knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed or (ii) if such
guarantee or security interest was granted as a result of collusion between the debtor and the
beneficiary of such guarantee or security interest with a view to give preference to the beneficiary over
the debtor’s other creditors. Consequently, the validity of any guarantees or security interests granted
by a Dutch legal entity may be challenged and it is possible that such challenge would be successful.

**_Further Limitations on Enforcement_**

Whether or not a Guarantor is subject to insolvency proceedings in the Netherlands, a guarantee
or a security document governed by Dutch law may be affected by, and a payment thereunder may be
withheld based on, the principles of reasonableness and fairness (redelijkheid en billijkheid), force
majeure (niet-toerekenbare _tekortkoming)_ and unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene
_omstandigheden) and other general defenses available to debtors under Dutch law. Other general_
defenses include claims that a guarantee or security interest should be avoided on grounds of abuse of
circumstances (misbruik van omstandigheden), deceit (bedrog), intimidation (bedreiging), mistake
(dwaling) or the right to set off (verrekening) and the right to suspend performance (opschortingsrecht)
or dissolve (ontbinding) a contract if the other party is in default in respect of its obligations.

The validity, binding effect and enforceability of a guarantee may also be successfully contested
by a Dutch company (or its receiver in bankruptcy or administrator in a suspension of payments) on the

191


-----

basis of an ultra vires claim. Such a claim will be successful if (i) the granting of a guarantee is
_ultra vires (i.e., exceeds the scope the entity’s objects or is not in the entity’s corporate interest) and_
(ii) the counterparty of such Dutch company under the relevant guarantee knew or should have known
(without inquiry) of this fact. In determining whether the granting of such guarantee is ultra vires, the
Dutch courts would not only consider the text of the objects clause in the articles of association of the
company but all relevant circumstances including whether the company derives certain commercial
benefits from the transaction in respect of which the guarantee was granted. If and to the extent that it
is determined that there is an imbalance, to the disadvantage of the company, between the value of the
commercial benefit and the amount for which the company is held liable, then irrespective of the
wording of the objects clause in its articles of association the company (and any bankruptcy receiver or
administrator in suspension of payments) may contest the validity or enforceability of the act and it is
possible that such contestation will be honored by the Dutch courts. Benefit may, according to Dutch
case law, consist of an indirect benefit derived by the company as a consequence of the
interdependence of such company with the group of companies to which it belongs. In addition, it is
relevant whether, as a consequence of the granting of the guarantee, the continuity of such company
would foreseeably be endangered by the granting of such guarantee. It remains possible that even if
such strong financial and commercial interdependence exists, the transaction may be declared void if it
appears that the granting of the guarantee cannot serve the realization of the relevant company’s
objects. The foregoing applies mutatis mutandis to the acceptance of joint and several liability for, or
providing or agreeing to provide security for, obligations of a third-party, whether or not affiliated, and
any other legal act having similar effect.

In connection with the removal of the prohibition on financial assistance for Dutch private
companies with limited liability as per October 1, 2012, it was mentioned in Dutch Parliament that the
granting of security, providing of a guarantee or accepting of liability with a view to the acquisition (or
the refinancing thereof) by any party of shares in the company’s share capital or the shares of its
(direct or indirect) parent company could, depending on the further circumstances, constitute an ultra
_vires act. At present, there is no Dutch case law on this subject._

A guarantee granted by a Dutch company and a security interest provided by a Dutch company
may be suspended or avoided by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam
(Ondernemingskamer van het Gerechtshof te Amsterdam) on the motion of the holder or holders of
10% or more of the shares in such company or who are entitled to an amount in shares or depositary
receipts issued therefor with a nominal value of €225,000 or such lesser amount as is provided by the
articles of association of such company. If the company has an issued share capital of at least
€22.5 million such motion may be made by a holder or holders of 1% or more of the shares in such
company or, provided those are listed on a qualifying trading venue, shares or depositary receipts
issued therefor with a value of €20 million or more or such lesser amount as provided in the
company’s articles of association. A trade union or other entities entitled thereto in the articles of
association of the relevant Dutch company may also submit a motion to the Enterprise Chamber of the
Court of Appeal in Amsterdam for this purpose. The guarantee or security itself may further be upheld
by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam, yet actual payment under it may be
suspended or avoided.

**THE CAYMAN ISLANDS**

Two of the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands (the “Cayman
**Obligors” and each of them a “Cayman Obligor”). Therefore, any insolvency proceedings by or**
against the Cayman Obligors would likely be based on Cayman Islands insolvency laws. However, it is
possible that the courts of other places may seek to assert jurisdiction over the Cayman Obligors for
the purpose of insolvency or restructuring proceedings (either as well as, or instead of, insolvency
proceedings in the Cayman Islands).

**_Winding up of a Cayman Island Company and Insolvency considerations_**

Cayman Islands insolvency law provides for three different systems for winding up companies,
namely (i) winding-up by order of the court; (ii) voluntary winding-up and (iii) voluntary winding-up
which becomes subject to the supervision of the court and then proceeds in the same manner as a

192


-----

winding-up by order of the court. Each system requires the appointment of a liquidator, who assumes
control of the company and whose function it is to collect, realize and distribute the assets of the
company to its creditors in accordance with the statutory order of priority and thereafter to distribute
any surplus among the company’s shareholders.

Generally speaking as a matter of Cayman Islands law, contracts to which a Cayman Islands
company is party are not automatically terminated and nor is the counterparty released from its
obligations, by the company’s entry into liquidation. The question of whether, as a contractual matter,
the commencement of a liquidation has any effect on the parties’ contractual obligations will fall to be
determined according to the governing law of each contract to which the company is a party. The
liquidator of a Cayman Islands company has no statutory right to disclaim onerous contracts.

A petition to the Court for a winding-up order may be presented by the company itself or by a
creditor or shareholder of the company. One of the grounds upon which a winding-up order may be
sought is that the company is unable to pay its debts as defined in Section 93 of the Cayman Islands
Companies Law (2018 Revision) (the “Companies Law”). Cayman Islands law emphasizes a cash
flow test in this regard.

When a winding-up order is made by the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands (the “Court”) or a
voluntary winding-up is continued under the supervision of the Court (i.e., in an official liquidation), an
automatic moratorium on litigation against the company is imposed pursuant to Section 97 of the
Companies Law—that is, proceedings may not be commenced or continued against the company
without the permission of the Court. Pursuant to Section 99 of the Companies Law, dispositions of
property, transfers of shares and alterations in the status of shareholders after the date of the
winding-up petition are void, unless the Court orders otherwise. The moratorium does not prevent a
secured creditor from realizing its security as set out below, nor does it affect any valid contractual
subordination rights, or rights of set off or netting of claims which were granted before the
commencement of the official liquidation.

It is a fundamental rule of Cayman Islands insolvency law that all ordinary unsecured and
unsubordinated creditors are treated equally irrespective of the nature of their claims. This is referred
to as the pari passu rule. This rule applies to the claims of ordinary unsecured and unsubordinated
creditors existing as of the date of the commencement of the winding up of the company, or whose
claims arise out of causes of action that accrued before the commencement of the winding up. Subject
to certain exceptions, the winding up is deemed to have commenced from the time of the presentation
of a winding-up petition. Generally speaking, a creditor having a validly created security interest over
property of a company in liquidation is entitled to enforce their security in accordance with its terms
without reference to the official liquidators and without the leave of the Court pursuant to section 142(1)
of the Companies Law. The liquidator may also in accordance with section 142(2) of the Companies
Law realize the security on behalf of the secured creditors, but for their benefit only.

The claims of preferred creditors under Cayman Islands law will rank ahead of unsecured creditors
and secured creditors holding security in the nature of a floating charge. All costs, charges and
expenses properly incurred in the winding up of the company, including the remuneration of the
liquidators, are payable out of the assets of the company in priority to unsecured claims.

An official liquidator must be a qualified insolvency practitioner who meets independence,
insurance and residence requirements (and as such a foreign receiver or liquidator may not act as the
sole liquidator of a Cayman Islands company). A liquidator is an officer of the Court and has fiduciary
duties to the company to act in good faith, for a proper purpose and for the benefit of the company at
all times.

A voluntary liquidation is most commonly instituted by way of special resolution of the voting
shareholders of the company. There is no automatic moratorium on litigation against the company in a
voluntary liquidation and no equivalent to Section 99 of the Companies Law; although Section 125 of
the Companies Law provides that a transfer of shares or alteration in the status of shareholders made
after the commencement of the winding up is void unless sanctioned by the liquidator. As with an
official liquidation, a voluntary liquidation does not prevent a secured creditor from enforcing their

193


-----

security in accordance with its terms. There are no restrictions on who may act as the voluntary
liquidator of a Cayman Islands company.

If, within 28 days of the commencement of the voluntary liquidation, the directors of the company
do not provide a declaration of solvency to the liquidator (which is then filed with the Registrar of
Companies), the liquidator is obliged by law to apply to the Court for a supervision order. The practical
effect of this is that, upon a supervision order being made, the voluntary liquidation proceeds as if it
were an official liquidation in all respects. This could lead to substantially increased costs of the
liquidation since, among other things, the liquidator will be obliged to provide the Court and the
stakeholders with regular reports detailing the assets and liabilities of the company and all of the steps
taken in the liquidation to date. A declaration of solvency takes into account the ability of the company
to pay its debts within a period of twelve months of the declaration being made. Even if the directors do
provide such a declaration, a voluntary liquidator may still apply to the Court for supervision in
circumstances where he thinks that such an order will facilitate a more effective, economic or
expeditious liquidation of the company in the interests of its creditors and shareholders.

**_Setting aside or avoiding a payment_**

A payment made by a Cayman Islands company may be set aside or avoided if the pre-conditions
discussed below are present. In addition, as referred to above, under Section 99 of the Companies
Law, any disposition of the company’s property made after the commencement of an official liquidation
is, unless sanctioned by the court, void.

_Fraudulent dispositions_

Under section 146 of the Companies Law, if a company goes into liquidation and it has entered
into a disposition at an undervalue with the intent to defraud its creditors, the Court may, on the
application of the liquidator, set the disposition aside.

A disposition will constitute a disposition at an undervalue if the disposition is on terms that provide
for the company to receive no consideration or a disposition for a consideration the value of which (in
money or money’s worth) is significantly less than the value (in money or money’s worth) of the
property which is the subject of the disposition.

The liquidator must show that there was intent to defraud a creditor, meaning an intention to
willfully defeat an obligation owed to a creditor. Unlike preferences below, there is no requirement to
show insolvency at the time of the disposition (however, it is unlikely that any creditors will be
prejudiced by any such disposition unless the company is insolvent).

Under section 4 of the Fraudulent Dispositions Law (1996 Revision) (the “Fraudulent
**Dispositions Law”), a disposition of property made with an intent to defraud (again defined as an**
intention of a transferor willfully to defeat an obligation owed to a creditor) and at an undervalue is
voidable at the instance of a creditor thereby prejudiced.

Under both the Companies Law and the Fraudulent Dispositions Law, an application to set aside a
disposition must be made within six years of the date of the disposition.

_Preferences_

If a company goes into liquidation but has previously granted a preference the Court may, on the
application of the liquidator, set the transaction aside.

If, within six months before the commencement of the winding up of a company, at a time when it
cannot pay its debts, the company makes a payment, or transfers or charges any of its property, or
takes or suffers any judicial proceedings, in favour of any of its creditors with a view to giving that
creditor a preference over the other creditors of the company, the transaction will be void. This is the
effect of section 145 of the Companies Law.

194


-----

The essence of a voidable preference is that the company, knowing that it cannot pay all its debts
in full, voluntarily and improperly makes a payment or gives a benefit to one creditor which results in an
inequality between him and the company’s other creditors. A transaction will only be set aside as a
voidable preference if the company’s act was undertaken voluntarily (as opposed to under the threat of
legal proceedings), the company’s dominant intention was to prefer the creditor (Cayman Islands law
imposes a subjective test) and the company was insolvent at the time the payment was made.

_Orders_

In the case of any of the above applying and where a court order is required, the court has very
wide statutory powers to make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to that which existed
before the transaction was entered into.

_Common law remedies_

Depending on the circumstances, in addition to the above statutory provisions the Court may
effectively reverse certain antecedent transactions based on common law and/or equitable principles.
For example, in the event a transaction amounts to a breach of the directors’ fiduciary duties, and if a
person knowingly receives the company’s property as a result of that breach in circumstances where it
would be unconscionable for them to retain the property, the Court may order that this property is being
held on constructive trust for the company. The application of these principles can be complex and
highly fact-sensitive.

There is no statutory provision dealing directly with insolvent trading in the Cayman Islands.
Directors may be liable for breach of their fiduciary obligations, however, if the company continues to
incur liabilities to the prejudice of the company’s creditors at a time when there is no reasonable
prospect of the company trading out of its financial difficulties.

**_Financial assistance_**

Under Cayman Islands law there is no statutory or common law rule which prohibits a company
from giving financial assistance to any person for the acquisition of the company’s shares. The
directors of the company must ensure the transaction is in the best interests of the company and is
carried out on a proper commercial basis, otherwise the transaction may be impugned on the basis of
breach of fiduciary duty.

**_Limitation on enforcement against a Cayman Islands Company—Schemes of arrangements_**

Enforcement against a Cayman Islands company may be limited by section 86 of the Companies
Law which provides that a compromise or arrangement between a company and its creditors or any
class of them shall, if sanctioned by the Court, be binding on all the creditors or a class of creditors. If
there are creditors who form a class, the class will be bound by the scheme if a majority representing
75% in value of the class who attended (whether in person or by proxy) and voted, approved the
scheme. Cayman Islands authority suggests that a class is constituted by “those persons whose rights
are not so dissimilar as to make it impossible for them to consult together with a view to their acting in
their common interest.” Two or more creditors are likely to constitute separate classes in a compromise
or arrangement if they hold security over different assets or hold security over the same asset but do
not rank equally.

Enforcement may also be limited by the principles of Cayman Islands law relating to the avoidance
of transactions discussed in section titled “—Setting Aside or Avoiding a Payment.”

**JERSEY**

**_Insolvency_**

One of the Guarantors is incorporated under the laws of Jersey (the “Jersey Guarantor”).
Consequently, in the event of an insolvency of the Jersey Guarantor, insolvency proceedings may be

195


-----

initiated in Jersey. There are two principal regimes for corporate insolvency in Jersey: “désastre” and
winding up (including just and equitable winding up and creditors’ winding up). The principal type of
insolvency procedure available to creditors under Jersey law is the application for an Act of the Royal
Court of Jersey (the “Royal Court”) under the Bankruptcy (Désastre) (Jersey) Law 1990, as amended
(the “Jersey Bankruptcy Law”) declaring the property of a debtor to be “en désastre” (a “declaration”).
On a declaration of “désastre,” title and possession of the property of the debtor (save for any property
held on trust) vests automatically in the Viscount, an official of the Royal Court (the “Viscount”). With
effect from the date of declaration, a creditor has no other remedy against the property or person of the
debtor, and may not commence or, except with the consent of the Viscount or the Royal Court,
continue any legal proceedings to recover the debt. With effect from the date of declaration, a secured
party may, however, without the consent of the Viscount and without an order of the court, exercise
any power of enforcement it may have under Part 7 (Enforcement of Security Interests) of the Security
Interests (Jersey) Law 2012 (the “2012 Law”) or Article 8 of the Security Interests (Jersey) Law 1983
(the “1983 Law”). To the extent that the proceeds of such enforcement are insufficient to discharge
liabilities owed, that secured party has no other remedy against the property or person of the debtor,
and may not commence any legal proceedings or, except with the consent of the Viscount or the Royal
Court, continue any legal proceedings to recover the balance of the debt.

Additionally, the shareholders of a Jersey company (but not its creditors) can instigate a
winding-up of an insolvent company (provided a declaration of “en désastre” has not been made in
respect of that Jersey company), which is known as a “creditors’ winding up” pursuant to Chapter 4 of
Part 21 of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended (the “Jersey Companies Law”). On a
creditors’ winding up, a liquidator is nominated by the shareholders. The creditors may approve such a
liquidator or apply to appoint a different liquidator. The liquidator will stand in the shoes of the directors
and administer the winding up, gather assets, make appropriate disposals of assets, settle claims and
distribute assets as appropriate. After the commencement of the winding up, no action can be taken or
continued against the company except with the leave of court. The shareholders must give creditors at
least 14 days’ notice of the meeting to commence the creditors’ winding up. After the commencement
of the creditors’ winding up, a secured party may, however, without the sanction of a liquidator and
without an order of the court, exercise any power of enforcement it may have under Part 7
(Enforcement of Security Interests) of the 2012 Law or Article 8 of the 1983 Law. To the extent that the
proceeds of such enforcement are insufficient to discharge liabilities owed, the secured party has no
other remedy against the company without the leave of the court. The corporate state and capacity of
the company continues until the end of the winding up procedure, when the company is dissolved. The
Jersey Companies Law requires a creditor of a company (subject to appeal) to be bound by an
arrangement entered into by the company and its creditors immediately before or in the course of its
winding up if, among other things, three quarters in number and value of the creditors acceded to the
arrangement.

**_Transactions at an undervalue_**

Under Article 17 of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 176 of the Jersey Companies Law, the
court may, on the application of the Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been
declared “en désastre”) or liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding up, a procedure which is
instigated by shareholders not creditors), set aside a transaction (including any guarantee or security
interest) entered into by a company with any person at an undervalue. There is a five-year look-back
period from the date of commencement of the winding up or declaration of “désastre” during which
transactions are susceptible to examination pursuant to this rule (the “relevant time”). The Jersey
Bankruptcy Law and Jersey Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without limitation)
those that define what constitutes a transaction at an undervalue, the operation of the relevant time
and the effect of entering into such a transaction with a person connected with the company or with an
associate of the company.

**_Preferences_**

Under Article 17A of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 176A of the Jersey Companies Law,
the court may, on the application of the Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been
declared “en désastre”) or liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding up, a procedure which is

196


-----

instigated by shareholders not creditors), set aside a preference (including any guarantee or security
interest) given by the company to any person. There is a 12 month look-back period from the date of
commencement of the winding up or declaration of “désastre” during which transactions are
susceptible to examination pursuant to this rule (the “relevant time”). The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and
Jersey Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without limitation) those that define what
constitutes a preference, the operation of the relevant time and the effect of entering into a preference
with a person connected with the company or with an associate of the company.

**_Extortionate_** **_transactions,_** **_onerous_** **_property,_** **_disclaimer_** **_and_** **_customary_** **_law_** **_fraudulent_**
**_dispositions_**

Under Article 17C of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 179 of the Jersey Companies Law,
the court may, on the application of the Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been
declared “en désastre”) or liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding up, a procedure which is
instigated by shareholders not creditors), set aside a transaction providing credit to the debtor
company which is or was extortionate. There is a three-year look-back period from the date of
commencement of the winding up or declaration of “désastre” during which transactions are
susceptible to examination pursuant to this rule. The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey Companies
Law contain detailed provisions, including (without limitation) those that define what constitutes a
transaction which is extortionate.

Under Article 15 of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law, the Viscount may within six months following the
date of the declaration of “désastre” and under Article 171 of the Jersey Companies Law, a liquidator
may within six months following the commencement of a creditors’ winding up, disclaim any onerous
property of the company. “Onerous property” is defined to include any moveable property, a contract
lease or other immoveable property if it is situated outside of Jersey that is unsaleable or not readily
saleable or is such that it might give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act,
and includes an unprofitable contract.

A disclaimer operates to determine, as of the date it is made, the rights, interests and liabilities of
the company in or in respect of the property disclaimed and discharges the company/Viscount from all
liability in respect of the property as of the date of the commencement of the creditors’ winding up from
the date of the declaration but shall not, except so far as is necessary for the purpose of releasing the
company from liability, affect the rights or liabilities of any other person. A person sustaining loss or
damage as a result of a disclaimer is deemed to be a creditor of the company to the extent of the loss
or damage and shall have standing as a creditor in the désastre or creditors’ winding up. The Jersey
Bankruptcy Law and Jersey Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without limitation)
in relation to the power to disclaim onerous property.

In addition to the Jersey statutory provisions referred to above, there are certain principles of
Jersey customary law (for example, a Pauline action) under which dispositions of assets with the
intention of defeating creditors’ claims may be set aside.

**GUERNSEY**

**_Commercial Benefit_**

Under Guernsey law, a guarantee may be liable to be set aside if there is no commercial benefit to
the guarantor in issuing it. The directors of the Guarantor incorporated in Guernsey (the “Guernsey
**Guarantor”) believe that the issuance of the Guarantee by the Guernsey Guarantor is of commercial**
benefit to the Guernsey Guarantor. However, there can be no assurance that the issuance of the
Guarantee will not be challenged by a liquidator, administrator or creditor, or that a court would support
the directors’ commercial benefit analysis.

**_Customary Law_**

Under Guernsey customary law, if it can be shown that the granting of a guarantee was made at
the time the guarantor was insolvent or that the guarantor became insolvent as a result of the

197


-----

guarantee, any person prejudiced by the guarantee may apply to the Royal Court of Guernsey to set
the guarantee aside as a transaction defrauding creditors. This provision of Guernsey customary law
may, in certain circumstances, be used by any person who claims to be the victim of the transaction,
not only liquidators. If a court were to find that the granting of the guarantee constituted a transaction
defrauding creditors, the court may make such orders as it thinks fit to protect the interests of those
creditors and to restore the guarantor’s position to what it would have been if the transaction had not
been entered into, including by voiding the guarantee. There is not yet decisive case law as to what, if
any, time limit there is on such a challenge.

**_Fraudulent and Wrongful Trading_**

Under Guernsey law, if the business of a company is carried on with intent to defraud creditors
(whether of the company or of any other person) or for any fraudulent purpose, every person who is
knowingly a party to the carrying on of the business in that manner is guilty of an offense. Civil liability
can also arise where in the course of the winding up of a company it appears that the business of the
company had been carried on with intent to defraud creditors (whether of the company or of any other
person) or for any fraudulent purpose. In that instance the Royal Court of Guernsey on application of a
creditor, member, liquidator or administrator may declare that any person who was knowingly a party to
the carrying on of the business in such manner is liable to make a contribution to the company’s
assets.

If in the course of an insolvent winding up of a Guernsey company it appears that at some time
before the commencement of the winding up a director (including an alternate, de facto or shadow
director) knew or ought to have concluded that there was no reasonable prospect of the company
avoiding going into insolvent liquidation, the Royal Court of Guernsey on the application of the
liquidator or any creditor or member of the company can declare that such director shall be liable to
make such contribution to the company’s assets as the Royal Court of Guernsey thinks proper, unless
upon the insolvent winding up becoming inevitable such director took every step to minimize potential
loss to the company’s creditors, which that director ought reasonably to have taken, taking into account
the skills expected of a person carrying on such functions carried out by that director and the actual
knowledge, skill and experience of that director.

**_Preferences_**

In Guernsey, if a liquidator can show that a company has given a “preference” to any person after
the commencement of a period of six months immediately preceding the start of the winding up
proceedings (or two years if the preference is to a connected person) and at the time of giving the
preference such company was unable to pay its debts or became as a result of giving the preference
unable to pay its debts, the Royal Court of Guernsey may make such order as it thinks fit for restoring
the position to what it would have been if the company had not given the preference. A company is
deemed to have given a preference to a person if that person is either one of the company’s creditors
or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities, and the company does anything or
permits anything to be done which improves that person’s position in the company’s liquidation. The
Royal Court of Guernsey may not make an order regarding a preferential transaction unless it is
satisfied that the company was influenced in deciding to give the preference by a desire to put that
person in a better position in the company’s liquidation, save where the person given a preference is
connected with the company where such desire is presumed unless the contrary is shown. If the Royal
Court of Guernsey finds that the guarantees are preferences, it has wide powers for restoring the
position of the guarantor to what it would have been if that preference had not been given, which could
include reducing payments under the guarantees or setting aside the Guarantees. However, there is
protection for a third-party who enters into a preferential transaction in good faith, for value and without
notice.

**_Choice of Law_**

Under Guernsey law, parties may choose the laws of a foreign jurisdiction as the governing law of
a guarantee so long as that choice is legal and bona fide. Under the Indenture, the Issuer and the
Guernsey Guarantor have submitted to the jurisdiction of the courts of New York. A judgment of a

198


-----

New York court should be enforceable in Guernsey in accordance with the common law rules of private
international law relating to the enforcement of foreign judgments, subject to certain qualifications more
specifically set out in the Section “Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.”

**_Désastre and Saisie proceedings_**

Under Guernsey customary law, a creditor who obtains a judgment for a debt against a debtor
from the Royal Courts of Guernsey may commence either désastre or saisie proceedings.

If a désastre is chosen, the judgment creditor must apply to the Royal Court of Guernsey for an
order that the judgment be executed against the debtor’s Guernsey situs personal property. Upon the
granting of such an order, HM Sheriff will arrest those assets up to the value of the arresting creditor’s
debt, and arrange a sale at public auction. The proceeds of sale are then distributed to the relevant
creditors in order of priority, in which unsecured creditors rank behind (amongst others) the fees and
expenses of the désastre, the costs (but not the claims) of the arresting creditor in pursuing the
_désastre, secured creditors and certain preferred creditors. Désastre does not extinguish creditors’_
claims against the debtor, to the extent that those claims remain unpaid.

Alternatively, saisie entails a process of realization and distribution of the debtor’s Guernsey situs
real estate. After obtaining judgment against the debtor, an arresting creditor electing saisie can obtain
an initial vesting order (granting them certain rights in respect of the Guernsey real estate) and an
interim vesting order (transferring the title to the Guernsey real estate to the arresting creditor).
Following this process, the arresting creditor calls for any other creditors of the debtor, who wish for
their claims to be attached to the arrested property, to file their claims in the saisie proceedings. At a
hearing in front of the Royal Court of Guernsey, each such creditor in turn (starting with those having
the lowest priority claims) elect whether they wish to either take the vested real estate of the debtor, on
condition that they repay all higher priority creditors in full, or renounce their claim against the debtor.
The remaining debts of those creditors who do not file a claim in the saisie proceedings remain
unaffected.

**_Administration_**

An administration order may be made in respect of a Guernsey company if the Royal Court of
Guernsey is satisfied that a company does not satisfy or is likely to become unable to satisfy the
“solvency test” prescribed by the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008 (as amended) and considers that
the making of an administration order may achieve either:

    - the survival of the company, and the whole or any part of its undertaking, as a going concern;
or

    - a more advantageous realization of the company’s assets than would be effected on a
winding up.

An administration order may be applied for by a company itself, the directors of the company, any
member of the company, any creditor of the company (including any prospective or contingent
creditor), the Guernsey Financial Services Commission in respect of supervised companies and
companies engaged in financial services business or, in the case of a company in respect of which the
Royal Court of Guernsey has made an order for winding up or which has passed a resolution for
voluntary winding up, a liquidator.

In the period between the presentation of the application for an administration order and ending
with the making of an order or the dismissal of the application:

    - no resolution may be passed or order made for the company’s winding up; and

    - no proceedings may be commenced or continued against the company except with the leave
of the Royal Court of Guernsey and subject to such terms and conditions as the Royal Court
of Guernsey may impose.

However, during this period, a creditor’s rights of set-off and secured interests (including security
interests within the meaning of the Security Interests (Guernsey) Law, 1993) and rights of enforcement

199


-----

thereof are unaffected and may be exercised without the leave of the Royal Court of Guernsey. In
addition, the leave of the Royal Court of Guernsey is not required for the presentation of an application
for the company’s winding up in that period.

Following the making of an administration order and during the period for which the administration
order is in force, the affairs, business and property of a company are managed by an administrator
appointed by the Royal Court of Guernsey, and no resolution may be passed or order made for the
company’s winding up and no proceedings may be commenced or continued against the company
except with the consent of the administrator or the leave of the Royal Court of Guernsey and subject to
such terms and conditions as the Royal Court of Guernsey may impose. However, a creditor’s rights of
set-off and secured interests (including security interests within the meaning of the Security Interests
(Guernsey) Law, 1993), and rights of enforcement thereof are unaffected.

**_Winding up_**

A Guernsey company may be wound up voluntarily if:

    - the period, if any, fixed by its memorandum or articles of incorporation for the duration of the
company expires, provided that the company passes an ordinary resolution that it be wound
up voluntarily; or

    - an event, if any, occurs on the occurrence of which the memorandum or articles of
incorporation of the company provide that the company should be dissolved, provided that the
company passes an ordinary resolution that it be wound up voluntarily; or

    - if the company passes a special resolution that it be wound up voluntarily.

From the commencement of a voluntary winding up (which occurs upon the passing of the
resolution for voluntary winding up), the company must cease to carry on business, except insofar as
may be expedient for the beneficial winding up of the company. The company, however, continues in
existence until dissolution.

In a voluntary winding up, the shareholders of the company, by way of ordinary resolution, appoint
the liquidator for the company and fill any casual vacancy in the appointment of a liquidator. The
shareholders of the company may delegate this authority to the creditors of the company by special
resolution.

Arrangements can be entered into between a Guernsey company which is being voluntarily wound
up and its creditors. Any arrangement entered into between a company and its creditors, subject to a
right of appeal, is binding if sanctioned by a special resolution of the company and by 75% in number
and value of its creditors. However, a creditor or shareholder of a company that has entered into such
an arrangement may, within 21 days beginning on the date of the completion of the arrangement, apply
to the Royal Court of Guernsey for an order that the arrangement be set aside. The Court may make
such order as it thinks fit for the setting aside, amendment, variation or confirmation of the
arrangement.

A company may be compulsorily wound up by the Royal Court of Guernsey if the company,
among other things: has by special resolution resolved that it be wound up by the Royal Court of
Guernsey; has not commenced business within one year beginning on the date of its incorporation;
suspends business for a whole year; has no members; is unable to pay its debts; or if the Royal Court
of Guernsey determines that it is just and equitable to do so. For this purpose, a company is deemed to
be unable to pay its debts if a creditor to whom the company owes a sum exceeding £750, which is
due, serves on the company through the office of H.M. Sergeant at the company’s registered office a
written demand for payment (commonly called a “statutory demand”), and the company, for a period of
21 days immediately following the date of service of the statutory demand, fails to pay the sum or to
secure payment to the reasonable satisfaction of the creditor; or if it is proved to the satisfaction of the
Royal Court of Guernsey that the company fails to satisfy the solvency test as prescribed by the
Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008, as amended.

On the making of an application for the compulsory winding up of a company or at any time
thereafter, any creditor of the company may apply to the Royal Court of Guernsey for an order

200


-----

restraining, on such terms and conditions as the Royal Court of Guernsey thinks fit, any action or
proceeding pending against the company; or appointing a provisional liquidator to ascertain the
company’s assets and liabilities, manage its affairs and do all acts authorized by the Royal Court of
Guernsey.

**ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

The Issuer is a Dutch company. The Guarantors are entities organized under the laws of the
Netherlands, the Cayman Islands, Jersey and Guernsey. Although the Issuer and the Guarantors have
agreed, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, to accept service of process in the United
States through agents designated for such purpose, it may not be possible for holders of the Notes to
(a) effect service of process upon the Issuer, the Guarantors or their respective directors or officers, or
(b) enforce judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon the civil liability of such entities or
persons under the US federal securities laws and state securities laws or other laws against any such
entities or persons in the courts of a foreign jurisdiction.

**THE NETHERLANDS**

The Issuer and the Dutch Guarantors are incorporated under Dutch law and have their registered
seat in the Netherlands. Civil liabilities based on the securities laws of the United States may not be
enforceable in the Netherlands, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment
obtained in US courts.

The United States and the Netherlands currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial
matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by any court in the United States, whether
or not predicated solely upon US securities laws, would not be enforceable in the Netherlands. In order
to obtain a judgment which is enforceable in the Netherlands, the claim must be re-litigated before a
competent Dutch court. A Dutch court will, under current practice, generally grant the same judgment
without relitigation on the merits if (a) that judgment results from proceedings compatible with the
Dutch concept of due process, (b) that judgment does not contravene public policy (openbare orde) of
the Netherlands, (c) the jurisdiction of the court has been based on an internationally acceptable
ground, and (d) the judgment by the court is not incompatible with a judgment rendered between the
same parties by a Dutch court, or with an earlier judgment rendered between the same parties by a
non-Dutch court in a dispute that concerns the same subject and is based on the same cause,
provided that the earlier judgment qualifies for recognition in the Netherlands.

Subject to the foregoing and provided that service of process occurs in accordance with applicable
treaties, investors may be able to enforce in the Netherlands judgments in civil and commercial matters
obtained from US federal or state courts. However, no assurance can be given that such judgments
will be enforceable. In addition, it is doubtful whether a Dutch court would accept jurisdiction and
impose civil liability in an original action commenced in the Netherlands and predicated solely upon US
federal securities laws.

**THE CAYMAN ISLANDS**

**_Enforcement of judgments—Cayman Islands companies_**

The courts of the Cayman Islands are unlikely (i) to recognize or enforce against a Cayman
Islands company judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions
of the securities laws of the United States or any State; and (ii) in original actions brought in the
Cayman Islands, to impose liabilities against Cayman Islands company predicated upon the civil
liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any State, so far as the liabilities
imposed by those provisions are penal in nature. In those circumstances, although there is no statutory
enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United States, the courts of the
Cayman Islands will recognize and enforce a foreign money judgment of a foreign court of competent
jurisdiction without retrial on the merits based on the principle that a judgment of a competent foreign
court imposes upon the judgment debtor an obligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been
given provided certain conditions are met. For such a foreign judgment to be enforced in the Cayman
Islands, such judgment must be final and conclusive and for a liquidated sum, and must not be in
respect of taxes or a fine or penalty, inconsistent with a Cayman Islands judgment in respect of the
same matter, impeachable on the grounds of fraud or obtained in a manner, and or be of a kind the
enforcement of which is, contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands (awards
of punitive or multiple damages may well be held to be contrary to public policy). A Cayman Islands
Court may stay enforcement proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere.

202


-----

**JERSEY**

The United States and Jersey currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial
matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the
United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon US federal securities laws,
would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in Jersey. In order to enforce any such US
judgment in Jersey, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in
Jersey. In such an action, a Jersey court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original
matter decided by the US court (subject to what is said below) and it would usually be possible to
obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Recognition
and enforcement of a US judgment by a Jersey court in such an action is conditional upon (among
other things) the following:

    - the US court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to Jersey
conflicts of laws principles;

    - the US judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and
unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a debt or definite sum of money
(although there are circumstances where non-money judgments can also be recognized);

    - the recognition or enforcement of the US judgment not contravening Jersey public policy;

    - the US judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like
nature, or in respect of a penalty or fine;

    - the US judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a
sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and not being otherwise in
breach of Section 5 of the United Kingdom Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 (as
extended to Jersey by the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 (Jersey) Order 1983);

    - the US judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of Jersey principles of
natural justice or rights under the European Convention on Human Rights; and

    - there not having been a prior inconsistent decision of a Jersey court in respect of the same
matter.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in Jersey judgments in civil and
commercial matters that have been obtained from US federal or state courts. However, there can be
no assurance that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in Jersey. In addition, it is
questionable whether a Jersey court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original
action was commenced in Jersey, instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon US federal
securities laws.

**GUERNSEY**

The US currently does not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement
of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters with Guernsey.

Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the US
based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon US federal securities laws, would not
automatically be recognized or enforceable in Guernsey. In order to enforce any such US judgment in
Guernsey, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in Guernsey. In
such an action, the Guernsey court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter
decided by the US court (subject to what is stated below) and it would usually be possible to obtain
summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Recognition and
enforcement of a US judgment by a Guernsey court in such an action is conditional upon (among other
things) the following:

    - the US court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to Guernsey
conflicts of laws principles;

    - the US Court having jurisdiction over the defendant to the original proceedings according to
Guernsey conflicts of laws principles;

203


-----

    - the US judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and
unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a debt for a definite sum of money;

    - the US judgment not contravening Guernsey public policy;

    - the US judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of tax, or other charges of a like
nature in respect of a penalty or fine;

    - the US judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of Guernsey principles of
natural justice;

    - there not having been a prior inconsistent decision of a Guernsey court between the same
parties; and

    - the Guernsey enforcement proceedings being commenced within six years from the date of
the US judgment.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in Guernsey judgments in civil and
commercial matters that have been obtained from US federal or state courts. Nevertheless, we cannot
assure you that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in Guernsey.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

The Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed to
purchase from the Issuer, the entire principal amount of the Notes. The sale will be made pursuant to a
Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) between, among others, the Issuer and Deutsche
Bank AG, London Branch, Goldman Sachs International, ABN AMRO Bank N.V., HSBC Bank plc and
ING Bank N.V., London Branch as representatives of the Initial Purchasers. The Initial Purchasers of
the Notes are Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, Goldman Sachs International, ABN AMRO Bank
N.V., HSBC Bank plc, ING Bank N.V., London Branch, Mizuho International plc, MUFG Securities
EMEA plc, NatWest Markets Plc and SMBC Nikko Capital Markets Limited.

The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement
to purchase Notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint. The Purchase Agreement provides that
the Initial Purchasers will purchase all of the Notes being sold pursuant to the Purchase Agreement if
any of them are purchased.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and
accept delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal
opinions by counsel.

The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes to purchasers at the price to investors indicated
on the cover page of the final offering memorandum. After the initial Offering, the Initial Purchasers
may from time to time vary the offering price and other selling terms without notice. To the extent that
any of the Initial Purchasers are not US-registered broker-dealers, they will only offer and sell Notes in
the United States through US-registered broker-dealers or affiliates, as appropriate. In addition, the
Initial Purchasers may offer and sell Notes outside the US through certain of their affiliates.

The Issuer and the Guarantors have agreed to indemnify the Initial Purchasers against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the US Securities Act, and will contribute to payments which the
Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect of any such liabilities. The Issuer will pay the
Initial Purchasers a commission and pay certain expenses relating to the Offering. During the period
from the date hereof through and including the date that is 90 days after the date hereof, none of the
Issuer, the Guarantors, or any of the Parent Guarantor’s subsidiaries will, without the prior written
consent of the representatives of the Initial Purchasers, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose
of any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Issuer or any of the Guarantors and having a tenor
of more than one year (other than the Notes).

No action has been or will be taken in any jurisdiction by us or the Initial Purchasers that would
permit a public offering of the Notes and the Guarantees, or the possession, circulation or distribution
of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where
action for that purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes and the Guarantees may not be offered or
sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or
advertisements in connection with the Notes or the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from
any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such
country or jurisdiction.

This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to
sell in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose
possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about, and to observe,
any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resales of the
Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

The Notes are new issues of securities with no established trading market. The Issuer has applied
for the listing of the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admittance of the
Notes to trading on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange’s Euro MTF Market. There can be no assurance
that the Notes will be listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. The Issuer has
been advised by the Initial Purchasers that the Initial Purchasers intend to make a market in the Notes
as permitted by applicable law but are not obligated to do so and may discontinue market making at

205


-----

any time without notice. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity of the trading market for the
Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and our Structure.”

The Stabilization Manager or persons acting on behalf of the Stabilization Manager may engage in
over-allotment, stabilizing transactions and covering transactions in accordance with Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a
short position for the Stabilization Manager. Stabilizing transactions permit bidders to purchase the
underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering
transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been
completed in order to cover short positions.

The Stabilization Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these
activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets
for, the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and our Structure.” These stabilizing
transactions and covering transactions may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would
otherwise be in the absence of these transactions.

In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers may purchase and sell Notes in the open
market. These transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover
positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the Stabilization Manager of a greater
number of Notes than they are required to purchase in the Offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of
certain bids or purchases made for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price
of the Notes while the Offering is in progress.

These activities by the Stabilization Manager, as well as other purchases by the Initial Purchasers
for their own accounts, may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the Notes. As a
result, the price of the Notes may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open
market. If these activities are commenced, they may be discontinued by the Initial Purchasers at any
time. These transactions may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the
terms of the Offering is made and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time at the sole
discretion of the Initial Purchasers. If these activities are commenced, they must end no later than the
earlier of 30 days after the Issue Date and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. These
transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty,
taxes, and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in
addition to the offering price set forth on the cover page hereof.

The Offering is being made in the United States in reliance upon an exemption from the
registration requirements of the US Securities Act for an offer and sale of the Notes which does not
involve a public offering. In making your purchase, you will be deemed to have made certain
acknowledgments, representations and agreements. See “Important Notice.” The Notes have not been
and will not be registered under the US Securities Act or with any securities regulatory authority of any
state or other jurisdiction in the United States and may not be offered or sold in the United States,
except to QIBs, in reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements of the US Securities
Act provided by Rule 144A. Prospective investors are hereby notified that sellers of the Notes may be
relying on the exemption from the registration requirements of Section 5 of the US Securities Act
provided by Rule 144A. The Notes may also be offered and sold to non-US persons in offshore
transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Transfer of the Notes (including the Guarantees) will be
restricted and each purchaser of the Notes (including the Guarantees) in the United States will be
required to make certain acknowledgements, representations and agreements, as described under
“Transfer Restrictions.”

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it:

    - has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause
to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the
meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any
Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or the
Guarantors;

206


-----

    - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to
anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the UK; and

    - any Notes will only be offered in the Netherlands to qualified investors (as defined in the
Prospectus Directive), unless such offer is made in accordance with the Dutch Financial
Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel toezicht).

Any offer or sale in the United States will be made by affiliates of the Initial Purchasers who are
broker-dealers registered under the Exchange Act.

The Issuer expects that delivery of the Notes will be made to investors on or about the date
specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which is five business days following the
date of this Offering Memorandum (such settlement being referred to as “T+5”). Under Rule 15(c)6-1
under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market are required to settle in two business days,
unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to
trade the Notes on the date of pricing or the next two successive business days will be required, by
virtue of the fact that the Notes will initially settle five business days following the date of pricing of the
Notes, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of such trade to prevent a failed settlement.
Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors.

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in
various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial
advisory, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities.
The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the
future perform, various financial advisory and investment banking services for the Issuer and its
affiliates, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. Each of the Initial
Purchasers or their respective affiliates are lenders under the New Facilities Agreement, and will
receive customary fees for their services in such capacities. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their
affiliates are lenders under the Existing Facilities Agreement and as a result will receive a portion of the
net proceeds of the Notes.

In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may
make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related
derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the
accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and
instruments of ours or our affiliates. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also receive
allocations of the Notes. If the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us,
they routinely hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management
policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering
into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short
positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions
could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers and their
affiliates may also make investment recommendations and publish or express independent research
views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that
they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

207


-----

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the US Securities Act or any state
securities laws and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption
from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the US Securities Act and
applicable state securities laws. Accordingly, the Notes offered hereby are being offered and sold only
to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A and to non-US persons (as defined in
Regulation S) in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. As used in this section, the terms

in any transaction not subject thereto and in each case in compliance with the conditions for
transfer set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5) below.

(2) It is not an “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144) of the Issuer or acting on behalf of the Issuer and it is

reliance on Rule 144A and the acquisition of the Notes will be for its own account or for the
account of another qualified institutional buyer; or

(b) a non-US person purchasing the Notes in an offshore transaction in accordance with
Regulation S.

(3) It acknowledges that neither we nor the Initial Purchasers, nor any person representing us or the
Initial Purchasers, has made any representation to it with respect to the offering or sale of any
Notes, other than the information contained in this Offering Memorandum, which Offering
Memorandum has been delivered to it and upon which it is relying in making its investment

of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and subject to its or

**Notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements**

**1.** **Reporting entity**

Intertrust N.V. (the “Company”) is a company domiciled in The Netherlands and was incorporated on
8 September 2014. The address of the Company’s registered office is Prins Bernhardplein 200,
Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements are unaudited, Quarterly figures and nine
month period ended 30 September 2017 are not audited, nor reviewed.

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company for the period from
1 January 2018 to 30 September 2018 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred
as the “Group” and individually as “Group entities”) and the Group’s interest in associates.

The Group provides Corporate, Fund, Capital Markets and Private Wealth Services. At 30 September
2018, the Group had operations in 41 offices, 29 jurisdictions and employed 2,532 FTEs (full-time
equivalent employees) (30 September 2017: 2,478 FTEs).

**2.** **Basis of preparation**

These condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the nine months ended 30 September
2018 have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting. They do not include
all the information required for a complete set of IFRS financial statements. Accordingly, the
condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017, which have been prepared in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. Selected
explanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant to an
understanding of the changes in the Group’s financial position and performance since the last annual
consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 (part of the “Annual
Report 2017”). The presentation currency of the group is the euro (€).

These condensed consolidated interim financial statements were authorised for issue by the
Management Board on 31 October 2018.

**3.** **Significant accounting policies and standards**

The accounting policies applied in these condensed consolidated interim financial statements are the
same as those applied in the Group’s consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended
31 December 2017 except for the adopted new standards.

To the extent relevant, all IFRS standards and interpretations including amendments that were in issue
and effective from 1 January 2018, have been adopted by the group from 1 January 2018

The Group has applied the classification, measurement and impairment requirements of IFRS 9
retrospectively as of 1 January 2018 by adjusting the opening balance sheet and opening equity at
1 January 2018 by EUR 1.2 million which is not material for the Group. We decided not to restate
comparative periods as permitted by IFRS 9 and decided to continue all of the Group’s hedge
relationships under IFRS 9 as of 1 January 2018.

As disclosed in our 2017 Annual Report IFRS 15, effective from 1 January 2018, does not have a
material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

These standards and interpretations had no material impact for the group.

**New standards and interpretations issued but not yet adopted**

All IFRS standards and interpretations that were in issue but not yet effective for reporting periods
beginning on 1 January 2017 have not yet been adopted and disclosed in the Group’s consolidated
financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017. No significant changes to the
disclosures are recognised at this stage.

F-8


-----

IFRS 16 introduces a single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model for lessees. A lessee
recognises a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability
representing its obligations to make lease payments for all leases with a term of more than 12 months,
unless the underlying asset is of low value. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The Group has a significant number of operating lease
contracts, mainly for real estate, and therefore significant changes are expected upon transition to
IFRS 16. It is not currently possible to quantify the impact as it will be dependent on the finalisation of
our detailed assessment, as well as accounting policy elections and judgments that should be
considered.

**4.** **Use of estimates and judgements**

The preparation of these interim financial statements requires management to make certain
assumptions, estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the interim financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from
those estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that
period or in the period of revision and the future periods if the revision affects both current and future
periods. For areas involving a higher degree of judgement or areas where assumptions and estimates
are significant to the (interim) financial statements, reference is made to Note 2.4 of the Group’s
consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017.

**5.** **Operating segments**

**5.1.** **Basis for segmentation**

The Management Board is the Chief Operating Decision Maker of the Group (CODM). The
responsibility of the Management Board is to assess performance and to make resource allocation
decisions across the Group.

The analysis of the business is organised on and managed from a geographical perspective. From
1 January 2018, revenue breakdown reflects Intertrust’s new reporting structure, whereby Cayman
Islands is included within the new Americas segment, together with Bahamas, Brazil, BVI, Curacao
and USA, previously part of Rest of the World.

The reconciliation table below shows the restated 2017 segmentation:

(*) Group HQ and IT costs are not allocated by operating segment

Quarterly figures and nine month period ended 30 September 2017 are neither audited, nor reviewed.

All operating segments are regarded as reportable segments due to their size/importance for the
overall understanding of the geographical business.

They are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to and used by the
Management Board.

The Management Board evaluates the performance of its segments based on Revenue and Adjusted
EBITA (“segment Revenue” and “segment Adjusted EBITA”). Management considers that such
information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of the respective segments. For the
reconciliation, please see Reconciliation of performance measures to reported results.

The individual Adjusted EBITA by operating segment excludes the allocation of Group HQ and IT
costs, which is then deducted from the total.

Profit/(loss) before income tax is not used to measure the performance of the individual segments as
items like amortisation of intangibles (except for software) and net finance costs are not allocated to
individual segments. So the reconciliation to Profit/(loss) before income tax according to IFRS is done
on Group level.

Consistent with the aforementioned reasoning, segment assets/liabilities are not reviewed regularly on
a segment basis by management and are therefore not included in the IFRS segment reporting.

(*) Group HQ and IT costs are not allocated by operating segment

Quarterly figures and nine month period ended 30 September 2017 are neither audited, nor reviewed.

For the three months ended 30 September 2018 and for the nine months ended 30 September 2018,
the presentation of the figures has been aligned accordingly to the operating segments defined as of
1 January 2018.

**5.3.** **Seasonality**

The business of the Group does not present pronounced cyclical patterns or seasonal evolutions in the
condensed consolidated interim statement of comprehensive income, however working capital follows
a seasonal pattern with a peak level at the end of the third quarter and a low level at the end of the first
quarter, primarily resulting from annual billing runs in the Americas in Q4 each year and in the
Netherlands and Luxembourg in January of each year.

Quarterly figures and nine month period ended 30 September 2017 are neither audited, nor reviewed.

**7.1.** **Basic earnings per share**

The calculation of basic earnings per share has been based on the following profit attributable to
ordinary shareholders of EUR 60,108 thousand for the nine months ended 30 September 2018 (for the
nine months ended 30 September 2017: EUR 58,675 thousand) and weighted-average number of
ordinary shares of 89,479,430 for the nine months ended 30 September 2018 (for the nine months
ended 30 September 2017: 90,890,356).

**7.2.** **Diluted earnings per share**

The calculation of diluted earnings per share has been based on the following profit attributable to
ordinary shareholders and weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding after adjustment
for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares of 1,257,671 for the nine months ended
30 September 2018 (for the nine months ended 30 September 2017: 3,050,793).

**7.3.** **Adjusted net income per share**

The Group calculates the Adjusted net income for the nine months ended 30 September 2018 to be
EUR 101.5 million (for the nine months ended 30 September 2017: EUR 100.9 million). Adjusted net
income is defined as Adjusted EBITA, less net interest costs of EUR 21.2 million (for the nine months
ended 30 September 2017: EUR 20.8 million) and less tax costs of EUR 13.2 million (for the nine
months ended 30 September 2017: EUR 12.3 million).

Based on this Adjusted net income and taking the weighted-average number of basic shares for the
nine months ended 30 September 2018 of 89,479,430 (for the nine months ended 30 September 2017:
90,890,356), the adjusted net income per share is EUR 1.13 (for the nine months ended 30 September
2017: EUR 1.11).

**8.** **Acquisition-related intangible assets**

During the nine months ended 30 September 2018, there was a new acquisition-related intangible
assets generated from the acquisition of Seed Outsourcing. During the nine months ended
30 September 2017 additional acquisition-related intangible assets were generated in the acquisition of
Azcona and SFM Spain. (Note 9).

The amortisation of acquisition-related intangible assets for the nine months ended 30 September
2018 is EUR 30,805 thousand (for the nine months ended 30 September 2017: EUR 30,845
thousand).

The goodwill per CGU is tested annually for impairment. As at 30 September 2018, there were no
impairment indicators and no impairment testing was required for the period. The intangible assets
other than goodwill were not tested for impairment because there were no impairment indicators at
30 September 2018.

**9.** **Business combinations**

**2018**

On 2 July 2018, the Group acquired Seed Outsourcing Pty Ltd (“Seed Outsourcing”). Seed
Outsourcing is a boutique Australian corporate and fund services firm, providing corporate secretarial,
director, domiciliation and payroll services to private equity and real estate fund managers. Intertrust
has been working with Seed Outsourcing for more than five years, enabling its global clients to grow
their business in Australia and New Zealand. Seed Outsourcing is based in Sydney and the team
consisted of six (6) employees.

The asset recognised was mainly attributable to revenue from new customers. While this acquisition
expands Intertrust’s global footprint it does not have a material impact on the Company’s financial
position or results and the terms of the transaction are not disclosed. Australia is included in the Rest
of the World reporting segment.

**2017**

**Acquisition of remaining SFM Spain stake and affiliated local service provider**

On 1 February 2017, the Group acquired the remaining 25% stake in Intertrust Management Spain,
S.L. (“SFM Spain”) together with the affiliated professional services activities of Azcona y Asociados de
Consultoría Tributaria, Jurídica y Contable, S.L. (“Azcona”).

The Group acquired a 75% stake in SFM Spain as part of the acquisition of Elian on 23 September
2016. The remaining 25% of SFM Spain was held by Azcona, a local Spanish competitor that
specialises in the provision of corporate secretarial, accounting and tax compliance services.

The transaction strengthens the Group’s position in Spain, making it a leading independent provider of
corporate, funds and capital market services. All Azcona staff members have transferred to the
Intertrust team, thereby more than doubling the headcount of the Madrid office to a total of 63
employees. The increased scale of the combined office strengthens the Group’s client service
capabilities and broadens its career opportunities for employees.

Other than the acquisition of the remainder of the shares, the asset recognised was mainly attributable
to revenue from new customers. The transaction does not have a material impact on the Company’s
financial position or results.

**10.** **Capital and reserves**

**10.1. Share capital**

The subscribed capital is 89,755,202 shares as at 30 September 2018 which is 2,244,190 shares less
compared to year end of 2017 due to cancellation of shares as at 25 September 2018. Nominal value
per share of EUR 0.60 did not change since 31 December 2017.

F-13


-----

**10.2. Share premium**

At 30 September 2018 the share premium amounts to EUR 630,441 thousand, unchanged compared
to 31 December 2017.

**10.3. Retained earnings**

The retained earnings include accumulated profits and losses, plus remeasurements of defined benefit
liability (asset) and equity-settled share-based payment.

The final dividend for the year 2017 of EUR 0.33 per share was paid on 12 June 2018.

An interim distribution of EUR 0.30 per share over financial year 2018 will be payable on the group’s
ordinary shares. The payment will be subject to 15% Dutch withholding tax. The interim dividend has
been recognised as liability and to be paid in November 2018.

**Treasury share reserve**

The treasury share reserve comprises the costs of the Company’s shares held by the Group. At
30 September 2018, the Group held 850,000 of the Company’s shares (31 December 2017:
1,856,354) following the share repurchase program which was completed on 31 May 2018. A total of
2,196,146 shares were purchased in 2018. These treasury shares will be used for employee stock
ownership and incentive plans. On 25 September 2018 2,244,190 shares were cancelled from the
treasury shares. Share cancellation above the EUR 0.60 nominal value was accounted in retained
earnings. Other movements in the treasury share reserve were related to vesting of share grants.

**11.** **Financial instruments**

**Credit risk**

Our internal credit risk assessment did not change compared to the disclosure Note 27 in our Annual
Report 2017. With respect to the net trade receivables, there are no indications as of the reporting date
that the debtors will not meet their payment obligations.

**Liquidity risk**

There has been no change in our liquidity risk assessment compared to our disclosure Note 27 in our
Annual Report 2017.

**Currency risk**

The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in exchange rates relates primarily to the Group’s
operating activities (when revenue or expense is denominated in a different currency from the Group’s
presentation currency). This did not change compared to previous year. The exposures are mainly with
respect to the US dollars (USD) and Pound sterling (GBP). The loans and borrowings of the Group are
denominated in Euros, Pound sterling and US Dollars.

**Interest rate risk**

The risk relates to the Group’s long term debt obligations with floating interest rates. To manage this
risk the company continues to hold interest rate swaps.

**Capital management**

The capital structure of the Group did not change significantly. Leverage ratio at the end of the
reporting period is 3.55 as cash was used to buy back shares and pay out the final net dividend for FY
2017. This is still well within the agreed level of our current facilities.

-----

**Fair value and fair value estimation**

The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities as at 30 September 2018 are estimated to
approximate their carrying value. There has been no change in the fair value estimation technique and
hierarchy of the input used to measure the financial assets/liabilities carried at fair value through profit
or loss compared with the method and hierarchy disclosed in our Annual Report 2017.

**12.** **Cash flow hedges**

The balance at 30 September 2018 includes interest rate swaps to cover part of the fluctuations on the
floating interest on the USD, GBP and EUR debt. There were no new swaps entered in 2018.

The USD and GBP hedges were assessed to be effective at 30 September 2018, the EUR hedge was
assessed as ineffective since 1 January 2017 therefore accounted its fair value change in the profit
and loss and started recycling of Other comprehensive income position as at 1 January 2017 also to
the profit and loss. Balance sheet positions recognised as assets at 30 September 2018 were EUR
775 thousand (2017: EUR 423 thousand), liabilities EUR 781 thousand respectively (2017: EUR 1.108
thousand).

**13.** **Contingencies**

There are a number of claims against the Group. We concluded that an aggregate amount of the
claims (including tax and HR related) against the Group cannot be reliably measured or we consider
that the possibility of outflow is not probable. Where necessary, legal and/or external advice has been
obtained and, in light of such advice, the risk of litigation is provided adequately.

**14.** **Commitments**

In the first nine months of 2018, there were no material changes to the Group’s commitments from
those disclosed in note 29 of our Annual Report 2017.

**15.** **Related parties**

During the nine months ended 30 September 2018, the transactions with related parties were
conducted at arm’s length basis.

The transactions with key management personnel do not deviate significantly from the transactions as
reflected in the financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017.

The Group has provided services to some entities related to Blackstone in the normal course of
business and at arm’s length basis.

**16.** **Subsequent events**

There are no significant events that have occurred since balance sheet date that would change the
financial position and which would require adjustment or disclosure in these condensed consolidated
interim financial statements.

**17.** **Non-IFRS Financial measures**

**Definitions**

For the definitions of non-financial measures we refer to the Glossary in the Annual Report 2017. Other

**Review report**

To: the shareholders, the Management Board and the Supervisory Board of Intertrust N.V.

**Introduction**

We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial information as at
30 September 2018 of Intertrust N.V., Amsterdam, which comprises the statement of financial position
as at 30 September 2018, the statements of profit or loss, comprehensive income, changes in equity
and cash flows for nine month period ended 30 September 2018, and the notes. The Management
Board of the Company is responsible for the preparation and presentation of this condensed
consolidated interim financial information in accordance with IAS 34 ‘Interim Financial Reporting’ as
adopted by the European Union. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on this interim financial
information based on our review.

**Scope**

We conducted our review in accordance with Dutch law including standard 2410, ‘Review of Interim
Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity’. A review of interim financial
information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting
matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope
than an audit conducted in accordance with auditing standards and consequently does not enable us
to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an
audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

**Conclusion**

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the
accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial information as at 30 September 2018 is not
prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34 ‘Interim Financial Reporting’ as adopted
by the European Union.

**Corresponding figures not audited or reviewed**

The condensed consolidated interim financial information as at 30 September 2017 is not audited or
reviewed. Consequently, the corresponding figures included in the statement of financial position, the
statements of profit or loss, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows and in the
related notes have not been audited or reviewed.

**Three months interim financial information not audited or reviewed**

The Company did not prepare condensed consolidated interim financial information for the three
months period ended 30 September 2017 and for the three months period ended 30 September 2018
and therefore such quarterly information is not audited or reviewed. Consequently, the three months
figures for the period ended 30 September 2017 and the three months figures for period ended
30 September 2018 included in the statements of profit or loss, comprehensive income, changes in
equity and cash flows and in the related notes of the condensed consolidated interim financial
information as at 30 September 2018 have not been audited or reviewed.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements**

**1.** **Reporting entity**

Intertrust N.V. (the “Company”) is a company domiciled in the Netherlands and was incorporated on
8 September 2014. The address of the Company’s registered office is Prins Bernhardplein 200,
Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

The financial statements of the Company for the period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017
comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred as the “Group” and individually as
“Group entities”) and the Group’s interest in associates.

The Company began trading its shares on Euronext Amsterdam on 15 October 2015 following an Initial
Public Offering (IPO). The Group provides trust, corporate and fund services, private client services
and capital markets services. As at 31 December 2017, the Group has operations in 28 countries and
employs 2,468 FTEs (full time equivalent) (31 December 2016: 2,359 FTEs).

**2.** **Basis of preparation**

**2.1.** **Statement of compliance**

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union for use in the EU (EU IFRS)
effective as at 31 December 2017 and in accordance with Title 9 Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

These consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Management Board on
22 February 2018. They are subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting to be held on 17 May
2018.

**2.2.** **Basis of measurement**

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the
following material items in the consolidated statement of financial position:

    - Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value;

    - Defined benefit liabilities/(assets) are recognised at the fair value of plan assets less the
present value of defined benefit obligation, as explained in note 3.4.

**2.3.** **Functional and presentation currency**

These consolidated financial statements are presented in Euro, which is the Company’s functional
currency. All financial information presented in Euro has been rounded to the nearest thousand
(EUR 000), unless otherwise indicated.

**2.4.** **Use of estimates and judgements**

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management
to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these
estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods
affected.

**Assumptions and estimation uncertainties**

Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in a
material adjustment within the next financial year is included in the following notes:

    - Note 15.1: impairment test: key assumptions underlying recoverable amounts of cash
generating units.

F-25


-----

    - Note 18: recognition of deferred tax assets: availability of future taxable profit against which
carry forward tax losses can be used.

    - Note 26: recognition and measurement of provisions and contingencies: key assumptions
about the likelihood and magnitude of an outflow of resources.

**Determination of fair values**

A number of the Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for
both financial assets and liabilities.

When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses market observable data as
much as possible. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on
the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:

    - Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

    - Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset
or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

    - Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data
(unobservable inputs).

If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability might be categorised in different
levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the
same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire
measurement.

The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting
period during which the change has occurred.

Further information about assumptions made in measuring fair values is included in the following
notes:

    - Note 3.5 “Equity-settled share-based payment arrangements”

    - Note 27.6 “Fair values of financial instruments”

**3.** **Significant accounting policies and standards**

**3.1.** **Changes in accounting policies and new standards**

The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these
consolidated financial statements, and have been applied consistently by Group entities. There have
been no significant changes compared to the prior year consolidated financial statements as at and for
the year ended 31 December 2016.

To the extent relevant, all IFRS standards and interpretations including amendments that were in issue
and effective from 1 January 2017, have been adopted by the Group from 1 January 2017:

    - Disclosure Initiative (Amendments to IAS 7)

    - Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets of Unrealised Losses (Amendment to IAS12)

    - Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014-2016 Cycle (Amendments to IAS12)

These standards and interpretations had no material impact for the Group.

F-26


-----

**New standards and interpretations issued but not yet effective**

A number of amendments to existing, as well as the issue of new accounting standards are applicable
from or after the beginning of the Group’s next annual reporting period. The expected impact of these
standards is summarised below:

IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, published in July 2014, replaces existing guidance in IAS 39 ‘Financial
Instruments’: Recognition and Measurement. IFRS 9 includes revised guidance on classification and
measurement of financial instruments, including an expected credit loss model for calculating
impairment on financial assets. In addition, IFRS 9 provides a revised hedging model. All of the
Group’s hedge relationships are expected to continue under IFRS 9. The Group implemented IFRS 9
per 1 January 2018. Based on our assessments, IFRS 9 does not have a material impact on the
consolidated financial statements for:

    - Future expected losses (additional allowances for trade receivables will be provided for).

    - Cash flow hedging (no impact identified).

    - Classification and measurement (no impact identified).

IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’, published in May 2014, establishes a framework
for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognised. It replaces existing guidance,
including IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS 11 ‘Construction Contracts’ and was implemented by the Group
per 1 January 2018. The Group has made an impact assessment. Based on this assessment, the
Group is aware that the impact on annual reporting is not material and mainly relates to fixed fee
services provided to customers.

IFRS 16 ‘Leases’, published in January 2016, introduces a new definition of a lease and eliminates the
current dual accounting model for lessees, bringing most leases on-balance in the financial statements
of the lessee. It replaces existing guidance on leases, including IAS 17. The Group expects to
implement IFRS 16 per 1 January 2019. The Group has a significant number of operating lease
contracts (see note 28), mainly for real estate, and therefore the following changes are expected upon
transition to IFRS 16:

    - Assets and liabilities of the Group are expected to increase due to recognition of the
right-of-use asset and a lease liability.

    - Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) will increase as the
lease payments will be presented as depreciation and net finance expense rather than
operational cost. Net income is not expected to materially change.

    - Operating cash flow will increase and investing and financing cash flow will decrease as the
lease payments will no longer be considered as operational.

A more detailed impact assessment will be made during 2018.

The following new or amended standards are not expected to have a significant impact on the
consolidated financial statements:

    - Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions (Amendments to
IFRS2);

    - Transfers of Investment Property (Amendments to IAS40);

    - Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014-2016 Cycle-various standards (Amendment to IFRS1
and IAS28);

    - IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration.

**3.2.** **Basis of consolidation**

**Business combinations**

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date,
which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group. The consideration transferred in the

F-27

acquisition is generally measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired. Any goodwill
that arises is tested annually for impairment. Any gain on a bargain purchase is recognised in profit or
loss immediately. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if related to the issue of debt or
equity securities.

The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing
relationships. Such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss.

Any contingent consideration payable is measured at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent
consideration is classified as equity, then it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within
equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised
in profit or loss.

**Non-controlling interests**

Non-controlling interests are measured either at their proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable
net assets or at fair value at the acquisition date. The choice of measurement is made on an
acquisition-by-acquisition basis.

Changes in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for
as equity transactions.

**Subsidiaries**

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or
has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those
returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the
consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which
control ceases.

**Loss of control**

When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the
subsidiary, and any related non-controlling interests and other components of equity. Any resulting
gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at
fair value when control is lost.

**Interests in equity-accounted investees**

The Group’s interests in equity-accounted investees comprise only interests in associates.

Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint
control, over the financial and operating policies.

Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method. They are recognised initially at
cost, which includes transactions costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated financial
statements include the Group’s share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of equityaccounted investees, after adjustments to align the accounting policies with those of the Group, from
the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.

When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity-accounted investee, the carrying
amount of the investment, including any long-term interests that form part thereof, is reduced to zero,
and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an
obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee.

**Transactions eliminated on consolidation**

Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

F-28


-----

Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are eliminated against the
investment to the extent of the Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the
same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.

**3.3.** **Revenue**

Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group
and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration
received or receivable, excluding discounts, rebates and sales taxes or duty. Revenue is recognised in
profit or loss to the prorate part of the services rendered to the client during the reporting date. When
the Group acts in the capacity of an agent rather than as the principal in a transaction, the revenue
recognised is the net amount of commission made by the Group.

Revenue comprises trust, corporate and fund services, private wealth services and capital markets
services. Revenue also includes subleasing rental income to Group clients.

**3.4.** **Employee benefits**

**Short-term employee benefits**

Short-term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised
for the amount expected to be paid if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay
this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be estimated
reliably.

**Defined contribution plans**

Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are expensed as the related service is
provided. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a
reduction in future payments is available.

**Defined benefit plans**

The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by
estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in the current and prior periods,
discounting that amount and deducting the fair value of any plan assets.

The calculation of defined benefit obligations is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the
projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a potential asset for the Group, the
recognised asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future
refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.

To calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any minimum funding
requirements that apply to any plan in the Group. Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability,
which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect
of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognised immediately in other comprehensive
income.

The Group determines the net interest expense/(income) on the net defined benefit liability/(asset) for
the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the
beginning of the annual period to the then-net defined benefit liability/(asset), taking into account any
changes in the net defined benefit liability/(asset) during the period as a result of contributions and
benefits payments. Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are
recognised in profit or loss.

When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit
that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The Group recognises gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the
settlement occurs.

F-29


-----

**Termination benefits**

Termination benefits are expensed at the earlier of when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of
those benefits and when the Group recognises costs for a restructuring. If benefits are not expected to
be settled wholly within 12 months of the end of the reporting period, then they are discounted.

**3.5.** **Equity-settled share-based payment arrangements**

The Company operates equity-settled share-based payment arrangements, under which services are
received from Management Board members and eligible employees.

The total amount to be expensed for services received is determined by reference to the grant date fair
value of the share-based payment awards made, including the impact of any non-vesting conditions
and market conditions.

Service conditions and non-market performance conditions are taken into account in the number of
awards expected to vest. The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line
basis over the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of the number of awards that will
eventually vest, with a corresponding credit to equity.

At each reporting date, the Company revises its estimates of the number of awards that are expected
to vest. The impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement
for the period.

The employer social security contributions payable in connection with an award made is considered an
integral part of the award, and the charge is treated as a cash-settled share-based payment
transaction.

**3.6.** **Leases**

The Group principally enters into operating leases for the rental of equipment and buildings. Payments
done under such leases are typically charged to profit or loss on a straight line basis over the period of
the lease. When an operating lease is terminated before the lease period has expired, any payment
required to be done to the lessor by way of penalty is recognised as an expense in the period in which
termination takes place. Any incentives received from the lessor in relation to operating leases are
recognised as a reduction of rental expense over the lease term on a straight line basis.

**3.7.** **Finance income and finance costs**

Finance income comprises interest income on loans and receivables, gains on the disposal of
available-for-sale financial assets, fair value gains on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
and gains on the remeasurement to fair value of any pre-existing interest in an acquiree. Interest
income is recognised as it accrues in profit or loss, using the effective interest method.

Finance costs comprise interest expenses on loans and borrowings, unwinding of the discount on
provisions and contingent consideration, losses on disposal of available-for-sale financial assets, fair
value losses on financial assets at fair value through profit and loss, impairment losses on financial
assets (other than trade receivables), gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in
profit or loss and reclassifications of amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income.

Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issuance of a financial instrument
are capitalised to the associate instrument and amortised to the profit or loss over the contractual term
using the effective interest method.

Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis as either finance income or finance cost
depending on whether foreign currency movements are in a net gain or loss position.

F-30


-----

**3.8.** **Foreign currency**

**Foreign currency transactions**

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies of Group
entities at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional
currency at the exchange rate at the reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated
in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are translated to the functional currency at the
exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items in a foreign currency
that are measured based on historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the
transaction. Foreign currency differences are generally recognised in profit or loss.

However, foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the following items are recognised
in other comprehensive income:

    - available-for-sale equity investments (except on impairment in which case foreign currency
differences that have been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to
profit or loss);

    - financial liabilities designated as hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation to the
extent that the hedge is effective; and

    - qualifying cash flow hedges to the extent the hedge is effective.

**Foreign operations**

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on
acquisition, are translated into Euro at the exchange rates at the reporting date (closing rates). The
income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into Euro at exchange rates at the dates of
the transactions.

The Group doesn’t own nor control any foreign operations in hyperinflationary economies.

Foreign currency differences are recognised in other comprehensive income, and accumulated in the
foreign currency translation reserve (translation reserve) in equity. However, if the foreign operation is
a non-wholly owned subsidiary, then the relevant proportion of the translation difference is allocated to
non-controlling interests.

When a foreign operation is disposed of such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost,
the cumulative amount in the translation reserve related to that foreign operation is reclassified to profit
or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. When the Group disposes of only part of its interest in a
subsidiary that includes a foreign operation while retaining control, the relevant proportion of the
cumulative amount is reattributed to non-controlling interests. When the Group disposes of only part of
its investment in an associate or joint venture that includes a foreign operation while retaining
significant influence or joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to
profit or loss.

When the settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither
planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, foreign currency gains and losses arising from such item
are considered to form part of a net investment in the foreign operation and are recognised in other
comprehensive income, and presented in the translation reserve in equity.

**Hedge of a net investment in foreign operations**

The Group applies hedge accounting to foreign currency differences arising between the functional
currency of foreign operation and the Company’s functional currency (euro).

To the extent that the hedge is effective, foreign currency differences arising on the translation of a
financial liability designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation are recognised in

F-31


-----

Other comprehensive income (OCI) and accumulated in the translation reserve. Any remaining
differences are recognised in profit or loss. When the hedged net investment is disposed of, the
relevant amount in the translation reserve is transferred to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on
disposal.

**3.9.** **Income tax**

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax is recognised in
profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly
in equity or in other comprehensive income.

**Current tax**

Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the period,
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax
payable in respect of previous years.

**Deferred tax**

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax
is not recognised for:

    - temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is
not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;

    - temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities to
the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and

    - taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences
when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax
liabilities and assets, and they relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable
entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net
basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.

A deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary
differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available, against which
they can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the
extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. Unrecognised deferred
tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become
probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

**3.10. Financial instruments**

**Classification and measurement**

The Group classifies issued financial instruments, or its component parts, on initial recognition as a
financial liability, a financial asset or an equity instrument in accordance with the substance of the
contractual arrangement. Instruments are classified as equity if, and only if:

    - the instrument includes no contractual obligation to deliver cash (or another financial asset) to
another entity or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities under conditions that are
potentially unfavourable; and

    - the instrument will or may be settled in the Group’s own equity instruments, it is a
non-derivative that includes no contractual obligation for the issuer to deliver a variable
number of its own equity instruments or a derivative that will be settled only by the issuer
exchanging a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of its own
equity instruments.

F-32


-----

**Non-derivative financial assets**

The Group initially recognises loans and receivables and deposits on the date that they are originated.
All other financial assets (including assets designated at fair value through profit or loss) are
recognised initially on the trade date, which is the date that the Group becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.

The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset
expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred. Any interest
in such transferred financial asset that is created or retained by the Group is recognised as a separate
asset or liability.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the consolidated statement
of financial position if, and only if, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either
to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

The Group classifies non-derivative financial assets into the following categories: financial assets at fair
value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity financial assets, loans and receivables and
available-for-sale financial assets.

**Loans and receivables**

Loans and receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in
an active market. Such assets are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable
transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and receivables are measured at amortised
cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.

Loans and receivables comprise loans, trade receivables and other receivables.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances bank accounts, cash on hand and cash in shortterm deposits with maturities of three months or less.

**Available-for-sale financial assets**

Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available
for sale, or are not classified in any of the above categories of financial assets. Available-for-sale
financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs.

Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes therein, other than
impairment losses and foreign currency differences on available-for-sale debt instruments, are
recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the fair value reserve in equity. When an
investment is derecognised, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is reclassified to profit or loss.

When investments in equity instruments do not have a quoted market price in an active market and its
fair value cannot be reliably measured, they are measured at cost.

Available-for-sale financial assets comprise equity shares.

**Non-derivative financial liabilities**

The Group initially recognises debt securities issued and subordinated liabilities on the date that they
are originated. All other financial liabilities (including liabilities designated at fair value through profit or
loss) are recognised initially on the trade date, which is the date that the Group becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.

The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled
or expire.

F-33


-----

The Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities into the other financial liabilities category. Such
financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, these financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method. Other financial liabilities comprise loans and borrowings and trade and other
payables.

**Derivative financial instruments, including hedge accounting**

The Group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its interest rate risk exposures.

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value; any directly attributable transaction costs are
recognised in profit or loss as they are incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are
measured at fair value and the accounting for the changes therein depend on whether the derivative is
designated as a hedging instrument or not.

**Cash flow hedges**

When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in
fair value of the derivative is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the
hedging reserve. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised
immediately in profit or loss.

The amount accumulated in equity is retained in other comprehensive income and reclassified to profit
or loss in the same period or periods during which the hedged item affects profit or loss.

If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold,
terminated or exercised, or the designation is revoked, then hedge accounting is discontinued
prospectively. If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the amount accumulated
in equity is reclassified to profit or loss.

**Other non-trading derivatives**

When a derivative financial instrument is not designated in a hedge relationship that qualifies for hedge
accounting, all changes in its fair value are recognised immediately in profit or loss.

**3.11. Property, plant and equipment**

Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and
accumulated impairment losses.

Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset and all costs
directly attributable to bringing the asset to working condition for its intended use. Such cost includes
the cost of replacing part of the plant and equipment and borrowing cost, if the recognition criteria are
met. When significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be replaced in intervals,
the Group recognises such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and depreciation,
respectively. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment less their residual
values on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives as follows:

    - Leasehold improvements 5 to 15 years—not exceeding the remaining lease terms

    - Equipment & motor vehicles 3 to 10 years

    - IT equipment 3 to 5 years

An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised, is derecognised
upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or
loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the profit or loss when the asset is
derecognised.

F-34


-----

The assets’ residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed at each financial
period end, and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.

**3.12. Intangible fixed assets and goodwill**

**Goodwill**

Goodwill that arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries is presented with intangible assets. For the
measurement of goodwill at initial recognition, see note 3.2.

After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. In respect of
equity-accounted investees, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the
investment, and any impairment loss is allocated to the carrying amount of the equity-accounted
investee as a whole.

**Intangible assets acquired separately**

Intangible assets that are acquired separately by the Group and have finite useful lives are measured
at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. The Group does not have
intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.

Amortisation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives from
the date that they are available for use. The amortisation expense is recognised in the consolidated
statement of profit and loss in the “Amortisation of acquisition-related intangible assets” caption. The
estimated useful lives are as follows:

    - Other intangible assets 1 to 5 years

    - Brand name 20 years

    - Customer relationships 14 to 17 years

Amortisation methods, estimated useful lives and residual value, are reviewed at each reporting date
and adjusted if appropriate, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a
prospective basis.

**Intangible assets acquired in a business combination**

Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognised separately from goodwill are
initially recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost).

Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination are measured
at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as
intangible assets that are acquired separately.

**3.13. Work in progress**

Work in progress represents the net unbilled amount expected to be collected from clients for work
performed to date. It is measured at the chargeable rate agreed with the individual clients less
progress billed.

**3.14. Impairment of assets**

**Non-derivative financial assets**

Financial assets not classified at fair value through profit or loss, including an interest in an equityaccounted investee, are assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective
evidence of impairment. A financial asset is impaired if there is objective evidence of impairment as a
result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, and that loss
event(s) had an impact on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably.

F-35


-----

Objective evidence that financial assets are impaired includes default or delinquency by a debtor,
restructuring of an amount due to the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise,
indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy, adverse changes in the payment status of
borrowers or issuers, economic conditions that correlate with defaults or the disappearance of an
active market for a security. In addition, for an investment in an equity security, a significant or
prolonged decline in its fair value below its cost is objective evidence of impairment.

**Financial assets measured at amortised cost**

The Group considers evidence of impairment for financial assets measured at amortised cost (loans
and receivables) at both a specific asset and collective level. All individually significant assets are
assessed for specific impairment. Those found not to be specifically impaired are then collectively
assessed for any impairment that has been incurred but not yet identified.

Assets that are not individually significant are collectively assessed for impairment by grouping
together assets with similar risk characteristics.

In assessing collective impairment, the Group uses historical trends of the probability of default, the
timing of recoveries and the amount of loss incurred, adjusted for management’s judgement as to
whether current economic and credit conditions are such that the actual losses are likely to be greater
or less than suggested by historical trends.

An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the
difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows
discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. Losses are recognised in profit or loss and
reflected in an allowance account against loans and receivables. Interest on the impaired asset
continues to be recognised. When an event occurring after the impairment was recognised causes the
amount of impairment loss to decrease, the decrease in impairment loss is reversed through profit or
loss.

**Available-for-sale financial assets**

Impairment losses on available-for-sale financial assets are recognised by reclassifying the losses
accumulated in the fair value reserve in equity to profit or loss. The cumulative loss that is reclassified
from equity to profit or loss is the difference between the acquisition cost, net of any principal
repayment and amortisation, and the current fair value, less any impairment loss recognised previously
in profit or loss. Changes in cumulative impairment losses attributable to application of the effective
interest method are reflected as a component of interest income.

If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of an impaired available-for-sale debt security increases and
the increase can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised,
then the impairment loss is reversed, with the amount of the reversal recognised in profit or loss.
However, any subsequent recovery in the fair value of an impaired available-for-sale equity security is
recognised in other comprehensive income.

**Non-financial assets**

The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than work in progress, current and
deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of
impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.

Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of
an asset or cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its recoverable amount.

The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less
costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present
value using a post-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of
money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU.

F-36


-----

For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets
that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of
other assets or CGUs. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs
that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.

Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs
are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU (group of CGUs),
and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU (group of CGUs) on a pro rata
basis.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss is
reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that
would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been
recognised.

**3.15. Share capital**

**Ordinary shares**

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary
shares are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.

**Repurchase and reissue of ordinary shares (treasury shares)**

When shares are repurchased, those are recognised as a debit to equity for the amount of the
consideration paid, which includes directly attributable costs and is net of any tax effects. Repurchased
shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented in the treasury share reserve. When
treasury shares are sold or reissued subsequently, the amount received is recognised as an increase
in equity, and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is transferred to or from retained
earnings.

**Dividends**

Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are declared.

**3.16. Provisions**

A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive
obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be
required to settle the obligation. If the impact of time value of money is material, provisions are
determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the
discount is recognised as finance cost.

**Legal matters**

A provision is recognised to cover the costs for legal proceedings or legal requirements, in those cases
where a probable outflow of cash is identified.

**Restructuring**

A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal
restructuring plan, and the restructuring either has commenced or has been announced publicly.
Future operating losses are not provided for.

**Onerous contracts**

A provision for onerous contracts is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of
terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is
established, the Group recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with the contract.

**4.** **Non IFRS Financial measures**

**4.1.** **Definitions**

For the definitions of non-financial measures we refer to the Glossary. Other than those defined there,
we give more clarification as listed below on:

    - Specific items of income or expenses are income and expenses items that, based on their
significance in size or nature, should be separately presented to provide further understanding
about the financial performance. Specific items include:

       - Transaction costs

       - Integration and transformation costs

       - Restructuring costs

       - Share-based payment upon IPO

       - Share-based payment upon integration

       - Income/expenses related to disposal of assets

Specific items are not of an operational nature and do not represent the core operating
results.

    - EBITDA is defined as profit/(loss) from operating activities excluding depreciation and
amortisation.

    - Adjusted earnings per share is defined as adjusted net income divided by the weightedaverage number of basic shares for the period.

    - Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding specific items.

    - Adjusted net income is defined as Adjusted EBITA less net interest costs, less tax costs and
share of profit of equity accounted investees (net of tax).

    - Adjusted EBITA is defined as Adjusted EBITDA excluding depreciation and amortisation of
other intangible assets.

    - Net debt leverage ratio is defined as total net debt divided by the adjusted EBITDA of
Intertrust, including adjusted EBITDA proforma contribution for acquisitions and full year
run-rate synergies related to acquisitions.

**5.** **Operating segments**

**5.1.** **Basis for segmentation**

The Management Board is the Chief Operating Decision Maker of the Group (CODM). The
responsibility of the Management Board is to assess performance and to make resource allocation
decisions across the Group.

F-38


-----

The analysis of the business is organised and managed on a geographical perspective. From
1 January 2017, due to integration of Elian, the Group no longer breaks out Elian results but defines
the operating segments as Netherlands, Luxembourg, Cayman, Jersey and Rest of the World,
whereby Guernsey is included in Rest of the World due to its size compared to the other bigger
operating segments. The following table shows the reconciliation between old and new segmentation
for 2016:

1 Group HQ and IT costs are not allocated by operating segment.

All operating segments are regarded as reportable segments due to their size/importance for the
overall understanding of the geographical business. They are reported in a manner consistent with the
internal reporting provided to and used by the Management Board.

The Management Board evaluates the performance of its segments based on Revenue and Adjusted
EBITA (“segment Revenue” and “segment Adjusted EBITA”). Management considers that such
information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of the respective segments.

The individual Adjusted EBITA by operating segment excludes the allocation of Group IT and HQ
costs, which is subsequently deducted from the total.

Profit/(loss) before income tax is not used to measure the performance of the individual segment as
items like amortisation of intangibles (except for software) and net finance costs are not allocated to
individual segments.

Consistent with the aforementioned reasoning, segment assets/liabilities are not reviewed regularly on
a segment basis by management and are therefore not included in the IFRS segment reporting.

Management does not distinguish between revenue streams resulting from different products or

**6.** **Acquisition of subsidiaries**

**6.1.** **Acquisition of remaining SFM Spain stake and affiliated local service provider**

The Group acquired a 75% stake in SFM Spain as part of the acquisition of Elian on 23 September
2016. The remaining 25% of SFM Spain was held by Azcona, a local Spanish competitor that
specialises in the provision of corporate secretarial, accounting and tax compliance services.

On 1 February 2017, the Group acquired the remaining 25% stake in Intertrust Management Spain,
S.L. (“SFM Spain”) together with the affiliated professional services activities of Azcona y Asociados de
Consultoría Tributaria, Jurídica y Contable, S.L. (“Azcona”).

The transaction strengthens the Group’s position in Spain, making it a leading independent provider of
capital markets, funds and corporate services. All Azcona staff members have transferred to the
Intertrust team, thereby more than doubling the headcount of the Madrid office to a total of 63
employees. The increased scale of the combined office strengthens the Group’s client service
capabilities and broadens its career opportunities for employees.

Other than the acquisition of the remainder of the shares, the significant asset recognised was mainly
attributable to revenue from new customers. The transaction does not have a material impact on the
Company’s financial position or results.

**6.2.** **Acquisition of Elian Group**

On 23 September 2016, the acquisition of Elian Group (“Elian”) from Elian’s management and funds
managed by Electra Partners LLP was completed. Elian was a Jersey-based regional trust & corporate
services provider, specialist in Capital Markets and Private Equity & Real Estate fund administration,
with a leadership position in Jersey and a strong presence in the United Kingdom and 13 other
jurisdictions.

From acquisition to 31 December 2016, Elian contributed revenue of EUR 28,496 thousand and
Adjusted EBITA of EUR 9,726 thousand. Based on management estimates, Elian’s revenue for 2016
was GBP 92.2 million and Adjusted EBITA was GBP 30.4 million.

The number of FTEs at year end amounts to 2,468 (2016: 2,359). Average headcount in FY 2017
amounts to 2,444 (2016: 1,882).

**8.** **Share-based payment arrangements**

**8.1.** **Description of share-based payment arrangements**

Following the listing on Euronext Amsterdam in 2015 and Elian acquisition in 2016, the Company has
implemented and made awards to members of the Management Board and selected eligible
employees under the three equity-settled share-based payment plans:

a) Executive Ownership Plan (‘EOP’)

b) Employee Stock Ownership Plan (‘ESOP’)

c) Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’)

**a)** **Executive Ownership Plan**

In 2015, the members of the Management Board and selected eligible members of senior management
were invited to make a one-off investment in the Company’s shares at a share price equal to the
introduction price of one Company share on Euronext Amsterdam at the time of the IPO. In addition,
shares representing 14% of the total investment amount were allocated to the eligible participants for
no consideration.

The grant date fair value of each of the 216,605 additional EOP shares allocated for no consideration
is equal to the introduction share price at the date of listing of EUR 15.50. As there are no vesting
conditions related to the additional EOP shares, the total grant date fair value was expensed
immediately.

For each of the acquired/allocated shares, the participants were awarded the conditional right to
receive one Company share for every three EOP shares (the Matching Shares) for no consideration.
These Matching Shares will vest on the third anniversary of the IPO settlement date to the extent that
the participant still (i) holds all the EOP shares and (ii) is employed by the Company on this date. The
grant date fair value of the Matching Shares is therefore expensed over a period of 3 years starting on
the IPO settlement date.

Details of the number of Matching Shares outstanding are as follows:

**In number of shares** **2017** **2016**

**Outstanding at the beginning of the year . . . . . . .** **495,146** **515,758**
Forfeited during the year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -60,017 -20,612

**Outstanding at the end of the year . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **435,129** **495,146**

The Matching Shares awarded in 2015 do not entitle the participants to receive dividends during the
vesting period.

As dividends are expected during the vesting period, the grant date fair value of the Matching Shares
of EUR 14.28 is equal to the introductory share price at the date of listing of EUR 15.50 less the
discounted value of expected future dividends.

**b)** **Employee Stock Ownership Plan**

On 23 September 2016, the Management Board made a one-time award of the Company’s shares
(ESOP Shares) to eligible employees from Elian, to celebrate Elian and Intertrust joining forces. These
awards entitled each eligible employee to receive 100 shares for no consideration, subject to continued
employment for a period of one year from the acquisition date. Participants were not entitled to receive
dividends during the vesting period. As dividends were expected during the vesting period of the new
ESOP shares, the grant date fair value of the Celebration Shares of EUR 19.92 (2016) is equal to grant
date share price less the discounted value of expected future dividends. The grants vested in
September 2017.

F-44


-----

On 19 October 2015, the Management Board made a one-time award of Company’s shares (ESOP
Shares) to eligible employees, excluding any participants in the EOP, to celebrate the completion of
the listing on Euronext Amsterdam. These ESOP Shares vested in October 2016.

On 1 February 2017, the Management Board has made a one-time award of the Company’s shares
(ESOP Shares) to eligible employees from Azcona, to celebrate Azcona and Intertrust joining forces.
These awards entitled each eligible employee to receive shares for no consideration, subject to
continued employment for a period of one year from the acquisition date. Participants are not entitled
to receive dividends during the vesting period. As dividends are expected during the vesting period of
the new ESOP shares, the grant date fair value of the Celebration Shares of EUR 16.82 is equal to
grant date share price less the discounted value of expected future dividends. The grants will vest in
February 2018. Only these ESOP shares remained outstanding at the end of 2017.

Details of the movement of the number of ESOP Shares were as follows:

**In number of shares** **2017** **2016**

**Outstanding at the beginning of the year . . . . . . .** **52,400** **208,780**
Awarded during the year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4,440 53,300
Forfeited during the year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -11,660 -37,820
Vested during the period . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -41,100 -171,860

**Outstanding at the end of the year . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **4,080** **52,400**

**c)** **Long term Incentive Plan**

As referred to in the 2015 remuneration policy, the LTIP was implemented during the first half year of
2016. Conditional performance shares were awarded to members of the Management Board and
eligible members of senior management on 1 April 2016 and on the same basis on 1 April 2017.

Performance shares are awarded on an annual basis and vest on the third anniversary of the grant
date subject to (i) the participant remaining in continuous employment during the performance period
and (ii) the Group meeting the pre-determined performance criteria. For Management Board members,
the vested performance shares will be subject to an additional holding period of 2 years. Participants
are not entitled to receive dividends during the vesting period.

For both performance cycles 2016-2019 and 2017-2020, an adjusted Earnings per Share (“adjusted
EPS”) growth performance target applies. Subject to meeting the service condition, the number of LTIP
Shares that vest will be between 0% (adjusted EPS growth below the threshold) and 150%. The
vesting percentage is allocated linearly between the threshold level and the maximum level. In 2017,
management estimated the conditions to result in vesting on 100% therefore valuation was adjusted
accordingly.

In addition, following the acquisition of Elian, the Management Board awarded performances shares
under the LTIP to eligible Elian employees on 1 November 2016. These awards have the same vesting
conditions (including the same vesting date) as the performance shares granted on 1 April 2016.

Details of the number of LTIP Shares awarded and outstanding (at target) are as follows:

**13.3. Adjusted net income per share**

The Group calculates the Adjusted net income for 2017 to be EUR 139.5 million (2016: EUR 113,2
million). Adjusted net income is defined as Adjusted EBITA, less net interest costs of EUR 27.8 million
(2016: EUR 21,0 million), plus share of profit and result of transactions with equity-accounted investees
and subsidiaries (net of tax) of EUR 0.7 million (2016: EUR 29 thousand loss) and less adjusted tax
costs of EUR 18.5 million (2016: EUR 19,5 million).

Based on this Adjusted net income and taking the weighted-average number of basic shares for the
year of 91,020,700 (2016: 88,942,943), the adjusted net income per share is EUR 1.53 (2016:
EUR 1,27).

The recoverable amount of goodwill has been determined for the five cash generating units as at
31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016. For each of the CGUs, the recoverable amount is
individually and collectively higher than its carrying amount.

**Key assumptions used in discounted cash flow projection calculations**

The recoverable amount of all CGUs has been determined based on a value-in-use calculation using
cash flow projections. The year 1 cash flow projections are based on detailed financial budget, the year
2 to 3 on detailed outlook and the years 4 to 5 on estimates, prepared by management for each cash
generating unit based on expectation of future outcomes taking into account past experience. The
revenue growth rate assumed beyond the initial 5-year period is 2.0% (2016: 2.0%), that has been
based on the expected long term inflation rate.

The values assigned to the key assumptions used in the value in use calculations are as follows for the
years 4 to 5:

    - Market growth: between 4% to 6%

    - Annual Margin Evolution: Improvement

    - Terminal value growth rate: 2%

    - Discount rate: between 7.95% to 8.61%

**Discount rate**

Discount rates represent a post-tax measure that reflect management’s estimate of the time value of
money and the risks specific to each unit that are not already reflected in the cash flows. In determining
appropriate discount rates for each unit, regard has been given to the industry average weighted
average cost of capital. The WACC takes into account both debt and equity. The cost of equity is
derived from the expected return on investment by the Group’s investors. The cost of debt is
determined by adding a debt risk premium to the risk free bonds rate with a maturity of 20 years.
CGU-specific risk is incorporated by applying industry beta factors that are evaluated annually based
on publicly available market data.

**Sensitivity to changes in assumptions**

Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which
recoverable amount is based would not cause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed the
recoverable amount of the CGUs.

**16.** **Investment in equity-accounted investees**

In 2016, as part of the Elian acquisition, the Group acquired participations in Structured Finance
Management Italia SRL and Elian Middle East B.S.C [©].

The Group’s share of profit in its equity-accounted investees for the year 2017 was a gain of
EUR 689 thousand including the result of the sale of the shares in ATC Switzerland sarl (see note 33)
(2016: loss of EUR 29 thousand). In 2017 the Group received a declared dividend of EUR
129 thousand from which EUR 75 thousand is not yet received as cash (2016: nil).

In 2016, and in order to finance the Elian acquisition, the Group entered into two new debt facilities
(through an amendment and restatement of the existing credit facilities signed on 1 October 2015)
consisting of a facility of GBP 94,000 thousand and another of EUR 147,500 thousand. In addition, the
Group did a drawdown under the multicurrency Revolver credit facility of EUR 25,000 thousand, USD
11,500 thousand and GBP 3,500 thousand in 2016. The USD and GBP drawn down facilities and EUR
7,000 thousand from the EUR facility were fully repaid by the end of 2016. The remaining EUR
18,000 thousand facility was repaid in 2017.

On 1 October 2015, the Company and Intertrust Group B.V. entered into a syndicated senior facilities
agreement between, among others, Intertrust Group B.V. as original borrower, the Company as parent
and original guarantor, ABN AMRO Bank N.V., Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, Morgan Stanley
Bank International Limited and UBS Limited as mandated lead arrangers, the financial institutions
named therein as original lenders, Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. as facility agent and security
agent (the “New Facilities Agreement”).

Under the facilities agreement there is a requirement to ensure that the leverage ratio in respect of any
relevant period on or after 31 December 2015 shall not exceed 4.75:1 (stepped down to 4.50:1 on
31 December 2017 and stepping further down to 4.25:1 on 31 December 2018). For the year ended
31 December 2017 the covenant was met with a headroom of 18.5% (2016: 22.9%).

The facilities agreement is guaranteed by the Company, Intertrust Group B.V. and certain subsidiaries,
and secured by, among others, first ranking rights of pledge over all outstanding shares in the share
capital of such subsidiaries.

**24.** **Employee benefits**

The Group sponsors defined benefit pension plans in Switzerland. In most other countries, employees
are provided with benefits under defined contribution plans. All pension plans comply with local tax and
legal restrictions in their respective country, including funding obligations.

F-59


-----

The Swiss pension plan is managed by an independent, legally autonomous entity which has the legal
structure of a foundation, according to Swiss Federal Law on Occupational Retirement, Survivors and
Disability (LPP). All benefits in accordance with the regulations are reinsured in their entirety with an
insurance company. The foundation provides benefits on a defined contribution basis. All employees
are participants to the plan and are insured against the financial consequences of old age, disability
and death. The insurance benefits are subject to regulations, with the LPP specifying the minimum
benefits that are to be provided. The employer and employees pay contributions to the pension plan at
rates set out in the foundation rules based on a percentage of salary. The amount of the retirement
account can be taken by the employee at retirement in the form of pension or capital. The risk of
disability, death and longevity are covered by the insurance company. The insurance company invests
the vested pension capital and provides a 100% capital and interest guarantee. Even if actuarial and
investment risks are covered by an insurance company, this plan is considered under IAS 19 as a
defined benefit plan because the employer remains exposed to termination contract risks.

The Group has also agreed to provide certain additional post-employment medical benefits to senior
employees in Curacao. These benefits are unfunded and the contributions equal the insurance
premiums paid.

The Group expects EUR 504 thousand (2016: EUR 497 thousand) in contributions to be paid to its
defined benefit plans in 2018.

**24.5. Sensitivity analysis**

Reasonably possible changes at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions,
holding other assumptions consistent, would have affected the defined benefit obligation by the
amounts shown below:

**(EUR 000)** **Increase** **Decrease**

**2017**
Impact of 1% change in the discount rate . . . . . . . . . . -908 1,253
Impact of 1% change in the future salary

Impact of 1% change in the future pension
increases . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 455 —
Impact of 1% change in the medical cost trend
rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 23 -19
Impact of 1 year change in the life expectancy . . . . . . 81 -84

**2016**
Impact of 1% change in the discount rate . . . . . . . . . . -1,553 1,979
Impact of 1% change in the future salary
increases . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 149 -259
Impact of 1% change in the future pension
increases . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 737 —
Impact of 1% change in the medical cost trend
rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 47 -40
Impact of 1 year change in the life expectancy . . . . . . 83 -216

Although the analysis does not take into account the full distribution of cash flows expected under the
plan, it does provide an approximation of the sensitivity of the assumptions shown.

All sensitivities are calculated using the same actuarial method as for the disclosed present value of
the defined benefit obligations at period-end.

**25.** **Deferred income**

Represents fixed fees invoiced to customers mainly in November-December for the next year(s). It
drives higher trade receivables and deferred income at the end of the period, with the deferred income
released in the following year. In some cases the fees are invoiced in advance for the complete life of
the structures resulting in non-current deferred income. The expected reversal of the balance of
deferred income is shown in the following table:

**(EUR 000)** **31.12.2017** **31.12.2016**

To be released within one year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 62,602 71,467

Company.

**Provision for restructuring**

Provisions for restructuring have been recognised to cover costs related to i) the restructuring as a
result of the integration with Elian and CorpNordic with a balance at 31 December 2017 of nil (2016:
EUR 171 thousand) and ii) other provisions of EUR 36 thousand (2016: EUR 97 thousand).

**Provision for onerous contracts**

**27.** **Financial instruments**

**27.1. Financial risk management**

**Overview**

The Group has exposure to the following main risks from its financial instruments: credit risk, liquidity
risk and market risk (including currency risk and interest rate risk).

This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s
objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Group’s management of
capital.

Further information about the risk management of the Group is included in the Compliance and Risk
Management chapter of this Annual Report.

**27.2. Credit risk**

Credit risk is the risk that a counterpart will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or
customer contract, leading to a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk primarily for trade
receivables and cash at banks. Customer credit risk is managed by each of the Group entities subject
to the Group’s policy, procedures and control relating to customer credit risk management. Outstanding
customer receivables are monitored and followed up continuously. Provisions are made when there is
objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect the debts (indication that the debtor is
experiencing significant financial difficulty or default, probability of bankruptcy, problems to contact the
clients, disputes with a customer, etc.). Analysis is done on a case by case basis in line with policies.

The cash and cash equivalents and interest receivable are held mainly with banks which are rated “A-”
or higher by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services or Fitch Ratings Ltd for long term credit rating.

**Exposure to credit risk**

The gross carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum
exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was as follows:

The ‘Other financial assets’ of EUR 455 thousand (2016: EUR 940 thousand) related to the
participations in non-controlling entities and shelf companies have not been included in this analysis.

The assets that are exposed to credit risk are held 19,1% by the Netherlands (2016: 18%), 22,0% by
Cayman Islands (2016: 26,9%), 12,8% by Luxembourg (2016: 12,7%), 10,8% by Jersey (2016: 10,9%)
and the remaining 35,3% (2016: 31,5%) by other jurisdictions.

Trade receivables are presented net of a provision for trade receivables. The credit risk is measured
and analysed on a local level, analysis on recoverability is done on a case by case basis in line with
policies. Evidence of historical experience demonstrates that debtors, in all ageing categories, have
high recoverability ratios.

The ageing of trade receivables and the provision for trade receivables at reporting date is disclosed
below. The movement schedule for the provision for trade receivables is included in note 19.

With respect to the trade receivables that are neither impaired nor past due, there are no indications as
of the reporting date that the debtors will not meet their payment obligations.

**27.3. Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk includes the risk to a shortage of funds and the risk to encounter difficulty in meeting
obligations associated with financial liabilities.

F-65


-----

The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds using a recurring liquidity planning tool: global cash
flow forecasts each 3 months covering the next 6 months periods and 12 months period for the one
prepared each December.

The Group entities prepare their own cash flow forecasts and they are centrally consolidated by Group
Finance. Group Finance monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity requirements, as well as the
Group’s actual cash and receivables position to ensure that it has sufficient cash to meet operational
needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its committed borrowings facilities to ensure that the
Group does not breach borrowings limits or covenants.

The Group entities keep the amounts required for working capital management and the excess cash is
transferred to Group Finance who defines the best use of these funds (cancellation of loans, deposits,
etc.).

Access to sourcing of funding is sufficiently available through the revolving credit facility agreement
that the Group has with banks (note 23).

**Exposure to Liquidity risk**

The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s non-derivative financial liabilities and
net-settled derivative financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments. This analysis
includes estimated interest payments and does not consider voluntary prepayments of bank debt that
could be possible following the agreements.

The flows expected for interest rate swaps will affect profit and loss in the same period as they are
expected to occur.

**27.4. Market risk**

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates,
will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of
market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable
parameters, while optimising the return.

**Currency risk**

The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in exchange rates relates primarily to the Group’s
operating activities (when revenue or expense is denominated in a different currency from the Group’s

F-66


-----

presentation currency). The exposures are mainly with respect to the US dollars (USD) and Pound
sterling (GBP). The loans and borrowings of the Group are denominated in Euro, Pound sterling and
US Dollars. The objective is to partly match the main cash flows generated by the underlying
operations of the Group with the debt which provides an economic hedge.

At 31 December 2017, the face value of the USD designated loan on the Group’s investment in its
Cayman subsidiary partially hedged was EUR 83,382 thousand (2016: EUR 94,868 thousand). The
USD loan is designated as a net investment hedge. No ineffectiveness was recognised from the net
investment hedge.

Similarly to the Cayman investment and the USD denominated bank loans relation, the Company
identified effective relations between the Jersey investment and its GBP denominated bank loans,
therefore the loan is fully designated as a hedge relation which also mitigates a portion of the foreign
currency translation risk arising from the subsidiary’s net assets.

As at 31 December 2017, the face value of the GBP designated loan was EUR 105,948 thousand
(2016: EUR 109,790 thousand). The GBP loan is designated as a net investment hedge. No
ineffectiveness was recognised from the net investment hedge.

The Group’s investments in other subsidiaries are not hedged.

**Exposure to currency risk**

The group has mainly currency exposure in USD and GBP, as presented follow:

A 10 percent strengthening of the USD and the GBP against all other currencies at 31 December 2017
would have affected the value of financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency and
affected equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown above. This analysis assumes that all other
variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant and ignores any impact of forecast sales and
purchases.

**Interest rate risk**

The risk relates to the Group’s long term debt obligations with floating interest rates. To manage this
risk, the Company entered into interest rate swaps.

**Exposure to interest rate risk**

At the reporting date the interest rate profile of the interest bearing financial instrument was:


**31.12.2016**
**Carrying amount**


**(EUR 000)**


**31.12.2017**
**Carrying amount**

**Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **-414,674** **-586,685**

Financial assets mainly include cash in bank accounts with interest bearing rates.

In January 2017, the Group entered into additional interest rate swaps that will cover, together with the
existing interest rate swaps, approximately 43% of floating interest rate on the loans and borrowings.

**Sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments**

An increase of 50 basis points in interest rates on loans and borrowings would have decreased the
profit and loss before tax by EUR 118 thousand (2016: EUR 1,083 thousand). A decrease of 50 basis
points in interest rates on loans and borrowings would have increased the profit and loss before tax by
EUR 714 thousand (2016: EUR 165 thousand increase).

The loans and borrowings have a 0% Euribor/Libor floor, whereas the interest rate swaps do not have
a 0% floor. As a result of current negative interest rates in Euribor this causes the asymmetric
variances. The sensitivity of interest to movements in interest rates is calculated on floating rate
exposures on debt, net of interest rate swaps. This analysis assumes that all other variables remain
constant.

**27.5. Capital management**

The capital structure of the Group consists of shares and share premium and bank borrowings. The
objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains healthy debt ratios in order
to support its business and face the obligations with banks.

The Group’s target is to reach a net debt leverage ratio between 2.0 and 2.5. This leverage ratio might
be higher depending on potential acquisitions. The bank borrowings are subject to covenants that are
tested bi-annual. For more information, see note 23.

**Level 2**

The fair value of the interest rate swaps is based on broker quotes and is calculated as the present
value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves. Fair values reflect the credit
risk of the instrument and include adjustments to take account of the credit risk of the Group entity and
counterparty when appropriate.

There are only level 2 fair values and no transfers between levels were applicable in 2017 and 2016.

**28.** **Operating leases**

**28.1. Leases as lessee**

The Group has entered into commercial leases on certain motor vehicles and items of office
equipment. These leases have an average life of between three and five years with no renewal option
included in the contracts.

The Group has entered into leases for rental agreements in different countries. The leases run for a
period between 3 and 24 years. Lease payments are increased with specific amounts and frequency
depending on the different agreements.

There are no restrictions placed upon the Group by entering into these leases.

Future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases as at 31 December are as
follows:


**Between one**
**and five years**


**Later than five**
**years**

as an expense in profit or loss in respect of operating leases. Total rental expenses reported in
statement of profit or loss includes utilities, maintenance and repairs expenses.

**28.2. Leases as lessors**

Some affiliates have entered into sublease contracts of office space.

Future minimum rental receivables under non-cancellable operating leases as at 31 December are as

During the period an amount of EUR 5,217 thousand (2016: EUR 4,015 thousand) were included in
revenues.

**29.** **Commitments**

The Group is committed to incur IT operational expenditure mainly related to managed communication
networks and outsourced activities of EUR 19,050 thousand (2016: EUR 17,246 thousand) spread
over the next five years.

**30.** **Contingencies**

The Belgian tax authorities delivered a notice to the third party liquidator of one of our former
subsidiaries for tax and penalties in the amount of approximately EUR 16.4 million (excluding interest)
in connection with Belgian dividend withholding tax over the payment of liquidation proceeds of this
subsidiary in 2012. The exemption for dividend withholding tax has been challenged by the tax
authorities on technical grounds. A formal tax complaint in view of full rescindment had been filed in
due course as there are good grounds to challenge the tax assessment. Following a formal decision
received in February 2017, a partial rescindment for an amount of approx. EUR 6.5 million has been
obtained. As per 21 May 2017 a formal court petition was filed within the legal deadline as we continue
to believe that there are sufficient grounds to counter the position taken by the tax authorities. The
pleading date has been set by the Court for 7 March 2019 at the earliest. We continue to believe that it
is still more likely than not that the claim from the tax authorities will be rejected by the court. An
amount of approx. EUR 9.8 million (excluding interest) remains under further dispute.

There are a number of additional possible claims against the Group. We concluded that in the
aggregate, including the above mentioned claims against the Group, these litigations cannot be reliably
measured or we consider that the possibility of outflow is not probable. Where necessary, legal and/or
external advice has been obtained and, in light of such advice, the risk of litigation is not expected to
have material impact on the financial situation of the Group.

F-71


-----

There is a legal claim which negatively impacted our 2017 figures and was accounted for in the
statement of profit and loss including the related legal fees. We believe that there is a reasonable
chance that we can recover all or part of this amount in due course.

position of Intertrust N.V. as at 31 December 2017 and of its result for the year then ended in
accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

**What we have audited**

We have audited the financial statements 2017 of Intertrust N.V. (the Company) based in Amsterdam.
The financial statements include the consolidated financial statements and the company financial
statements.

The consolidated financial statements comprise:

**Basis for our opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing. Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the ‘Our responsibilities for the audit of

**Audit approach**

**Summary**


MATERIALITY

- Materiality of EUR 4 million

- 4% of profit before tax from continuing operations


GROUP AUDIT

- 85% audit coverage of revenue (2016: 87%)


KEY AUDIT MATTERS

- Revenue recognition including management override of controls

- Valuation of goodwill

- Information technology

- Provisioning for litigation and claims


UNQUALIFIED OPINION


**Materiality**

Based on our professional judgement we determined the materiality for the financial statements as a
whole at EUR 4 million (2016: EUR 4 million). The materiality is determined with reference to the 2017
profit before tax from continuing operations (4%, 2016: 4%). We consider profit before tax from
continuing operations as the most appropriate benchmark as it reflects the operations of the Company.
We have also taken into account misstatements and/or possible misstatements that in our opinion are
material for the users of the financial statements for qualitative reasons.

We agreed with the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board that misstatements in excess of EUR
200,000 which are identified during the audit, would be reported to them, as well as smaller
misstatements that in our view must be reported on qualitative grounds.

**Scope of the group audit**

Intertrust N.V. is at the head of a group of components. The financial information of this group is
included in the consolidated financial statements of Intertrust N.V.

Because we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are responsible for directing, supervising
and performing the group audit. In this respect, we have determined the nature and extent of the audit
procedures to be carried out for group entities. Our group audit mainly focused on significant
components. Components that were considered significant based on revenues are included in-scope.
These were the operating entities in the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Cayman Islands and Jersey.
Furthermore, we included in-scope the operating entity in Guernsey as we assigned a significant risk of
material misstatement to one or more account balances of this entity. In addition, to arrive at a
sufficient overall coverage over all relevant significant account balances, we included operating entities
in Singapore, UK, Curacao and Hong Kong in scope of our group audit as well.

F-85


-----

All components in scope for group reporting are audited by KPMG member firms, with the exception of
Intertrust Management Services Pte ltd and its subsidiaries (Singapore). The contribution to revenues
of this entity amounts to 2% of Intertrust N.V. For all components in scope an audit of the complete
reporting package (full scope audit) was performed. For components in scope we have:

    - sent detailed instructions to all component auditors, covering significant areas including the
relevant risks of material misstatement and set out the information required to be reported to
the group audit team;

    - held conference calls and/or physical meetings with the auditors of the components. During
these visits, meetings and calls, the planning, risk assessment, procedures performed,
findings and observations reported to the group auditor were discussed in more detail;

    - visited component locations in the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Jersey where we performed
audit file reviews. We performed an off site file review for Cayman Islands;

    - performed audit procedures ourselves at group entity Intertrust N.V. and the Dutch operating
entity;

    - performed audit procedures over significant accounts such as external debt and goodwill and
share based payments ourselves at the group holding entity in the Netherlands;

The group audit team has set component materiality levels, which ranged from EUR 0.5 million to EUR
2.5 million, based on the mix of size and financial statement risk profile of the components within the
group to reduce the aggregation risk to an acceptable level. The consolidation of the group, the
disclosures in the annual accounts and certain accounting topics that are performed at group level are
audited by the group audit team.

For components not in scope we performed analytical reviews to confirm our assessment that the risk
of a material misstatement within these components is low.

By performing the procedures mentioned above at group components, together with additional
procedures at component and group level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit
evidence about the group’s financial information to provide an opinion about the consolidated financial
statements.

**Our key audit matters**

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in
our audit of the financial statements. We have communicated the key audit matters to the Audit
Committee of the Supervisory Board. The key audit matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all
matters discussed.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in
forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

**Revenue recognition including management override of controls**

**Description**

Revenue recognition, in particular existence of revenue and possible fraudulent recognition, is
considered a significant audit risk. It relates to potential manipulation of cut-off and management
override of controls. Management override relevant to internal controls is an action or a series of
actions performed by management to bypass established internal controls. Management override may
be driven by a desire to reach analyst expectations. It relates to cut-off of revenue whereby revenue is
overstated.

member firm of the KPMG network of independent companies affiliated with KPMG International Cooperative
(‘KPMG International’), a Swiss entity.

F-86


-----

**Our response**

We addressed the risk of fraudulent revenue recognition and management override of controls in our
audit through a combination of controls testing and substantive testing:

    - analysis of the Company’s accounting policies and practices in relation to revenue recognition
for compliance with IAS 18;

    - testing of the key controls in relation to revenue recognition, such as the approval of hours
recorded, reconciliation of written hours to contractual hours and review of proposed
invoicing;

    - testing operating effectiveness of the IT application and the thereto related general IT controls
applicable to the system for financial reporting to the extent that this is considered effective
and efficient in our audit approach. For components where IT controls are not completely
implemented, this resulted in additional substantive audit procedures such as manual
reconciliations of data;

    - testing the cut-off of revenue with underlying documentation. Amongst others, we verified the
timing of revenue recognition with underlying contracts and written hours, whether credit
notes issued after balance sheet date related to revenue recognised in 2017, the existence
and collectability of WIP and debtor balances by reconciling WIP to written hours and testing
the aging of accounts receivable;

    - performance of journal entry testing of both manual journal entries recorded directly in the
consolidation, and manual journal entries recorded by local management, using data analysis
tools where possible.

**Our observation**

Our audit procedures did not reveal indications of management override of controls in the accounting
applied by management in relation to the recognition of revenue.

**Valuation of goodwill**

**Description**

The company has recognised a significant amount of goodwill, predominantly emanating from the
acquisitions of Elian and ATC businesses amounting to EUR 949 million. A potential risk of impairment
of goodwill exists, to the extent future developments negatively deviate from the assumptions applied
during the acquisition of the group entities. The annual impairment test performed was significant to
our audit because the assessment process is complex and judgmental and is based on assumptions
that are affected by expected future economic and market conditions. In performing the impairment
testing for goodwill, the Company used various assumptions in respect of future economic and market
conditions, such as the discount rate, revenue and margin development, expected inflation rates and
the terminal value growth.

The amounts recognised, the assumptions and sensitivities used to assess the recoverable amount
recognised are disclosed in note 15 of the consolidated financial statements.

**Our response**

We performed, amongst others, the following procedures:

    - assessed whether the impairment testing was performed in accordance with IAS 36;

    - assessed if management’s determination of the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) and the related
carrying value was appropriate;

    - challenged management’s budget and cash flow forecasts, performing sensitivity analyses
and a retrospective review of the historical accuracy of management’s estimations;

-----

    - involved a KPMG valuation specialist to assist the audit team in the audit procedures
performed. The valuation specialist’s procedures included evaluating the reasonability of the
methodology used by management, assessing the reasonableness of the key input
parameters (including WACC and terminal growth rate), performing independent sensitivity
analyses over the outcome of the impairment test, and comparison with market data (EBITDA
multiples);

    - assessment of the mathematical accuracy of the goodwill impairment model and assessment
of whether the calculated present value is higher/lower than the Book Value or the Net
Assets;

    - reconciliation of source data used in the model to underlying accounting records.

**Our observation**

Based on our procedures performed we observed management’s assumptions for the valuation of
goodwill were within an acceptable range.

**Information technology**

**Description**

The Company is dependent on its IT-infrastructure for the continuity of its operations. The Company
makes investments in its IT systems and—processes as it is continuously improving the efficiency and
effectiveness of the IT-infrastructure and the reliability and continuity of the electronic data processing.

**Our response**

We have assessed the reliability and continuity of the electronic data processing, as far as necessary
within the scope of our audit. For that purpose we included IT-auditors in our audit team. As part of the
audit of the financial statements, we obtained an understanding of the entity’s IT environment, and how
the Company has mitigated the risks arising from the IT systems by testing internal controls insofar
relevant for the purpose of our audit, that maintain the integrity of information and the security of the
data that such systems process.

Our procedures included amongst others the assessment of change management, user access
management and information security and data privacy policies in the IT-domain and testing of the
relevant internal controls with respect to relevant IT-systems and -processes. We have also assessed
how the company deals with risk assessment and operational security measures, threat management
and vulnerability management.

To the extent where (part of the) General IT Controls are not operating effectively, we assess the
impact on our substantive audit approach. This may include test of details of specific transactions and
reports.

**Our observation**

We have no material findings as part of our audit of the financial statements in respect of the reliability
and continuity of the electronic data processing of the Company.

**Provisioning for litigations and claims**

**Description**

Considering the line of business of Intertrust N.V., in combination with the inherent subjectivity in
identifying, monitoring and provisioning of claims, there is a potential risk of a material misstatement in
claim provisions and contingency disclosures. Management’s assessment of legal claims is included in
note 26 of the consolidated financial statements, and the description of contingencies is included in
note 30.

member firm of the KPMG network of independent companies affiliated with KPMG International Cooperative
(‘KPMG International’), a Swiss entity.

F-88


-----

**Our response**

We performed, amongst others, the following procedures:

    - testing management’s controls in relation to risks of breaches in laws and regulations, as well
as testing controls over litigation and claims monitoring and provision recognition;

    - challenge of management’s assessment of litigations and claims, and subsequent
assessment of provisions required as at the year-end;

    - inquiry with in-house legal counsel and verification of substantive evidence.

**Our observation**

The results of our procedures regarding the provision for litigation and claims to be recognized were
satisfactory.

In 2016, we had included as key audit matter ‘accounting for acquisition of Elian’. As the Elian
acquisition is a 2016 event, this is not considered a key audit matter anymore.

**Report on the other information included in the annual report**

In addition to the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon, the annual report contains other
information that consists of:

    - the Management Board’s Report on pages 4 to 73;

    - the other information pursuant to Part 9 of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code on page 171;

    - the Report from the Supervisory Board on pages 74 to 87;

    - the Corporate Governance report on pages 88 to 103.

Based on the following procedures performed, we conclude that the other information:

    - is consistent with the financial statements and does not contain material misstatements;

    - contains the information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and understanding obtained through our
audit of the financial statements or otherwise, we have considered whether the other information
contains material misstatements.

By performing these procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch
Civil Code and the Dutch Standard 720. The scope of the procedures performed is substantially less
than the scope of those performed in our audit of the financial statements.

The Management Board of the Company is responsible for the preparation of the other information,
including the Management Board report in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code
and the other information pursuant to Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

**Report on other legal and regulatory requirements**

**Engagement**

We were engaged by the General Meeting as auditor of Intertrust N.V. on 25 September 2015, as of
the audit for year of 2015 and have operated as statutory auditor ever since that financial year.

**No prohibited non-audit services**

We have not provided prohibited non-audit services as referred to in Article 5(1) of the EU Regulation
on specific requirements regarding statutory audits of public-interest entities.

**Description of responsibilities regarding the financial statements**

**Responsibilities of the Management Board of the Company and the Supervisory Board for the**
**financial statements**

The Management Board of the Company is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the
financial statements in accordance with EU-IFRS and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.
Furthermore, the Management Board of the Company is responsible for such internal control as
management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

As part of the preparation of the financial statements, the Management Board of the Company is
responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial
reporting frameworks mentioned, the Management Board of the Company should prepare the financial
statements using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Management Board of the
Company either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative
but to do so. The management Board of the Company should disclose events and circumstances that
may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern in the financial
statements.

The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.

**Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements**

Our objective is to plan and perform the audit engagement in a manner that allows us to obtain
sufficient and appropriate audit evidence for our opinion.

Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means we may
not detect all material errors and fraud during our audit.

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on
the basis of these financial statements. The materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit
procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is included in the
appendix to this auditor’s report. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

**Appendix**

We have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional scepticism throughout
the audit, in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and independence
requirements. Our audit included among others:

    - identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing audit procedures responsive to those
risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than
the risk resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;

    - obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Intertrust’s internal control;

    - evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management of the Company;

    - concluding on the appropriateness of Management of the Company’s use of the going
concern basis of accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on Intertrust’s
ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are
based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future
events or conditions may cause a company to cease to continue as a going concern;

    - evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including
the disclosures; and

    - evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events
in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

Because we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for directing,
supervising and performing the group audit. In this respect we have determined the nature and extent
of the audit procedures to be carried out for group components. Decisive were the size and/or the risk
profile of the group components or operations. On this basis, we selected group components for which
an audit or review had to be carried out on the complete set of financial information or specific items.

We communicate with the Supervisory Board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant findings in internal control that
we identify during our audit. In this respect we also submit an additional report to the audit committee
in accordance with Article 11 of the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audits
of public-interest entities. The information included in this additional report is consistent with our audit
opinion in this auditor’s report.

We provide the Supervisory Board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related
safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Supervisory Board, we determine the key audit matters:
those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements. We describe these
matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or
when, in extremely rare circumstances, not communicating the matter is in the public interest.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements**

**1.** **Reporting entity**

Intertrust N.V. (the “Company”) is a company domiciled in The Netherlands and was incorporated on
8 September 2014. The address of the Company’s registered office is Prins Bernhardplein 200,
Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

The financial statements of the Company for the period from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2016
comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred as the “Group” and individually as
“Group entities”) and the Group’s interest in associates.

In 2015, the Company became the parent of the Group by the contribution of the entire issued and
outstanding share capital of Intertrust Topholding (Luxembourg) S.à r.l. and the outstanding amounts
under the Shareholder loans to the Company’s shareholder’s equity as a capital contribution. The
capital contribution has been accounted for as a capital reorganisation under common control and
measured at the IFRS historical carrying values of Intertrust Topholding (Luxembourg) S.à r.l. The
consolidated financial statements are therefore presented as if the Company had been the parent
company of the Group throughout the periods presented.

The Company began trading its shares on Euronext Amsterdam on 15 October 2015 following an Initial
Public Offering (IPO). The Group provides corporate and funds services, private client services and
capital markets services. At 31 December 2016, the Group has operations in 30 countries and employs
2,359 FTEs (full time equivalent employees) (31 December 2015: 1,714 FTEs).

**2.** **Basis of preparation**

**2.1.** **Statement of compliance**

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union for use in the EU (EU IFRS)
effective as at 31 December 2015 and in accordance with Title 9 Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

These consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Management Board on
31 March 2017. They are subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders.

**2.2.** **Basis of measurement**

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the
following material items in the consolidated statement of financial position:

    - Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value;

    - Defined benefit (assets) liabilities are recognised at the fair value of plan assets less the
present value of defined benefit obligation, as explained in Note 3.3

**2.3.** **Functional and presentation currency**

These consolidated financial statements are presented in Euro, which is the Company’s functional
currency. All financial information presented in Euro has been rounded to the nearest thousand
(EUR 000), unless otherwise indicated.

**2.4.** **Use of estimates and judgements**

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management
to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these
estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods
affected.

F-99


-----

**Assumptions and estimation uncertainties**

Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in a
material adjustment within the next financial year is included in the following notes:

    - Note 16.1: impairment test: key assumptions underlying recoverable amounts of cash
generating units.

    - Note 19: recognition of deferred tax assets: availability of future taxable profit against which
carry forward tax losses can be used.

    - Note 27: recognition and measurement of provisions and contingencies: key assumptions
about the likelihood and magnitude of an outflow of resources.

**Determination of fair values**

A number of the Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for
both financial assets and liabilities.

When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses market observable data as
much as possible. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on
the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:

    - Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

    - Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset
or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

    - Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data
(unobservable inputs).

If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability might be categorised in different
levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the
same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire
measurement.

The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting
period during which the change has occurred.

Further information about assumptions made in measuring fair values is included in the following
notes:

    - Note 28.6 “Fair values of financial instruments”

    - Note 3.4 “Equity-settled share-based payment arrangements”

**2.5.** **Changes in accounting policies**

Except for the changes below, the Group has consistently applied the accounting policies set out in
Note 3 to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.

In the current year, the Group has applied the following new standards and amendments to standards
that are mandatorily effective for an accounting period that begins on or after 1 January 2016:

    - Disclosure Initiative (Amendments to IAS 1)

    - Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements (Amendments to IAS 27)

    - Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 Cycle (Amendments to IFRSs)

These changes and all other amendments had no significant impact on the disclosures or amounts
recognised in the consolidated financial statements.

F-100


-----

**3.** **Significant accounting policies**

The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these
consolidated financial statements, and have been applied consistently by Group entities.

**3.1.** **Basis of consolidation**

**Business combinations**

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date,
which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group. The consideration transferred in the
acquisition is generally measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired. Any goodwill
that arises is tested annually for impairment. Any gain on a bargain purchase is recognised in profit or
loss immediately. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if related to the issue of debt or
equity securities.

The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing
relationships. Such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss.

Any contingent consideration payable is measured at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent
consideration is classified as equity, then it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within
equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised
in profit or loss.

**Non-controlling interests**

Non-controlling interests are measured either at their proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable
net assets or at fair value at the acquisition date. The choice of measurement is made on an
acquisition-by-acquisition basis.

Changes in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for
as equity transactions.

**Subsidiaries**

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or
has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those
returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the
consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which
control ceases.

**Loss of control**

When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the
subsidiary, and any related non-controlling interests and other components of equity. Any resulting
gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at
fair value when control is lost.

**Interests in equity-accounted investees**

The Group’s interests in equity-accounted investees comprise only interests in associates.

Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint
control, over the financial and operating policies.

Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method. They are recognised initially at
cost, which includes transactions costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated financial
statements include the Group’s share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of equityaccounted investees, after adjustments to align the accounting policies with those of the Group, from
the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.

F-101


-----

When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity-accounted investee, the carrying
amount of the investment, including any long-term interests that form part thereof, is reduced to zero,
and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an
obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee.

**Transactions eliminated on consolidation**

Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are eliminated against the
investment to the extent of the Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the
same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.

**3.2.** **Revenue**

Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group
and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration
received or receivable, excluding discounts, rebates and sales taxes or duty. Revenue is recognised in
profit or loss to the prorate part of the services rendered to the client during the reporting date. When
the Group acts in the capacity of an agent rather than as the principal in a transaction, the revenue
recognised is the net amount of commission made by the Group.

Revenue comprises corporate and fund services, private client services and capital markets services.
Revenue also includes subleasing rental income to Group clients.

**3.3.** **Employee benefits**

**Short-term employee benefits**

Short-term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised
for the amount expected to be paid if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay
this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be estimated
reliably.

**Defined contribution plans**

Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are expensed as the related service is
provided. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a
reduction in future payments is available.

**Defined benefit plans**

The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by
estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in the current and prior periods,
discounting that amount and deducting the fair value of any plan assets.

The calculation of defined benefit obligations is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the
projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a potential asset for the Group, the
recognised asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future
refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.

To calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any minimum funding
requirements that apply to any plan in the Group. Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability,
which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect
of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognised immediately in other comprehensive
income.

F-102


-----

The Group determines the net interest expense (income) on the net defined benefit liability (asset) for
the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the
beginning of the annual period to the then-net defined benefit liability (asset), taking into account any
changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset) during the period as a result of contributions and
benefits payments. Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are
recognised in profit or loss.

When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit
that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The Group recognises gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the
settlement occurs.

**Termination benefits**

Termination benefits are expensed at the earlier of when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of
those benefits and when the Group recognises costs for a restructuring. If benefits are not expected to
be settled wholly within 12 months of the end of the reporting period, then they are discounted.

**3.4.** **Equity-settled share-based payment arrangements**

The Company operates equity-settled share-based payment arrangements, under which services are
received from Management Board members and eligible employees.

The total amount to be expensed for services received is determined by reference to the grant date fair
value of the share-based payment awards made; including the impact of any non-vesting conditions
and market conditions.

Service conditions and non-market performance conditions are taken into account in the number of
awards expected to vest. The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line
basis over the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of the number of awards that will
eventually vest, with a corresponding credit to equity.

At each reporting date, the Company revises its estimates of the number of awards that are expected
to vest. The impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement
for the period.

The employer social security contributions payable in connection with an award made is considered an
integral part of the award, and the charge is treated as a cash-settled share-based payment
transaction.

**3.5.** **Leases**

The Group principally enters into operating leases for the rental of equipment and buildings. Payments
done under such leases are typically charged to profit or loss on a straight line basis over the period of
the lease. When an operating lease is terminated before the lease period has expired, any payment
required to be done to the lessor by way of penalty is recognised as an expense in the period in which
termination takes place. Any incentives received from the lessor in relation to operating leases are
recognised as a reduction of rental expense over the lease term on a straight line basis.

**3.6.** **Finance income and finance costs**

Finance income comprises interest income on loans and receivables, gains on the disposal of
available-for-sale financial assets, fair value gains on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
and gains on the remeasurement to fair value of any pre-existing interest in an acquiree. Interest
income is recognised as it accrues in profit or loss, using the effective interest method.

Finance costs comprise interest expenses on loans and borrowings, unwinding of the discount on
provisions and contingent consideration, losses on disposal of available-for-sale financial assets, fair

F-103


-----

value losses on financial assets at fair value through profit and loss, impairment losses on financial
assets (other than trade receivables), gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in
profit or loss and reclassifications of amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income.

Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue a financial instrument are
capitalised to the associate instrument and amortised to the profit or loss over the contractual term
using the effective interest method.

Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis as either finance income or finance cost
depending on whether foreign currency movements are in a net gain or loss position.

**3.7.** **Foreign currency**

**Foreign currency transactions**

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies of Group
entities at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional
currency at the exchange rate at the reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated
in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are translated to the functional currency at the
exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items in a foreign currency
that are measured based on historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the
transaction. Foreign currency differences are generally recognised in profit or loss.

However, foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the following items are recognised
in other comprehensive income:

    - available-for-sale equity investments (except on impairment in which case foreign currency
differences that have been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to
profit or loss);

    - financial liabilities designated as hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation to the
extent that the hedge is effective; and

    - qualifying cash flow hedges to the extent the hedge is effective.

**Foreign operations**

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on
acquisition, are translated into Euro at the exchange rates at the reporting date (closing rates). The
income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into Euro at exchange rates at the dates of
the transactions.

The Group doesn’t own nor control any foreign operations in hyperinflationary economies.

Foreign currency differences are recognised in other comprehensive income, and accumulated in the
foreign currency translation reserve (translation reserve) in equity. However, if the foreign operation is
a non-wholly owned subsidiary, then the relevant proportion of the translation difference is allocated to
non-controlling interests.

When a foreign operation is disposed of such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost,
the cumulative amount in the translation reserve related to that foreign operation is reclassified to profit
or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. When the Group disposes of only part of its interest in a
subsidiary that includes a foreign operation while retaining control, the relevant proportion of the
cumulative amount is reattributed to non-controlling interests. When the Group disposes of only part of
its investment in an associate or joint venture that includes a foreign operation while retaining
significant influence or joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to
profit or loss.

F-104


-----

When the settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither
planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, foreign currency gains and losses arising from such item
are considered to form part of a net investment in the foreign operation and are recognised in other
comprehensive income, and presented in the translation reserve in equity.

**Hedge of a net investment in foreign operations**

The Group applies hedge accounting to foreign currency differences arising between the functional
currency of foreign operation and the Company’s functional currency (euro).

To the extent that the hedge is effective, foreign currency differences arising on the translation of a
financial liability designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation are recognised in
OCI and accumulated in the translation reserve. Any remaining differences are recognised in profit or
loss. When the hedged net investment is disposed of, the relevant amount in the translation reserve is
transferred to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal.

**3.8.** **Income tax**

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax is recognised in
profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly
in equity or in other comprehensive income.

**Current tax**

Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the period,
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax
payable in respect of previous years.

**Deferred tax**

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax
is not recognised for:

    - temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is
not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;

    - temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities to
the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and

    - taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences
when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax
liabilities and assets, and they relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable
entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net
basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.

A deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary
differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available, against which
they can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the
extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. Unrecognised deferred
tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become
probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

F-105


-----

**3.9.** **Financial instruments**

**Classification and measurement**

The group classifies issued financial instruments, or its component parts, on initial recognition as a
financial liability, a financial asset or an equity instrument in accordance with the substance of the
contractual arrangement. Instruments are classified as equity if, and only if:

    - The instrument includes no contractual obligation to deliver cash (or another financial asset)
to another entity or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities under conditions that
are potentially unfavourable; and

    - If the instrument will or may be settled in the Group’s own equity instruments, it is a
non-derivative that includes no contractual obligation for the issuer to deliver a variable
number of its own equity instruments or a derivative that will be settled only by the issuer
exchanging a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of its own
equity instruments.

**Non-derivative financial assets**

The Group initially recognises loans and receivables and deposits on the date that they are originated.
All other financial assets (including assets designated as at fair value through profit or loss) are
recognised initially on the trade date, which is the date that the Group becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.

The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset
expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred. Any interest
in such transferred financial asset that is created or retained by the Group is recognised as a separate
asset or liability.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the consolidated statement
of financial position if, and only if, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either
to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

The Group classifies non-derivative financial assets into the following categories: financial assets at fair
value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity financial assets, loans and receivables and
available-for-sale financial assets.

**Loans and receivables**

Loans and receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in
an active market. Such assets are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable
transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and receivables are measured at amortised
cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.

Loans and receivables comprise loans, trade receivables and other receivables.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances bank accounts, cash on hand and cash in shortterm deposits with maturities of three months or less.

**Available-for-sale financial assets**

Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available
for sale, or are not classified in any of the above categories of financial assets. Available-for-sale
financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs.

F-106


-----

Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes therein, other than
impairment losses and foreign currency differences on available-for-sale debt instruments, are
recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the fair value reserve in equity. When an
investment is derecognised, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is reclassified to profit or loss.

When investments in equity instruments do not have a quoted market price in an active market and its
fair value cannot be reliably they measured are measured at cost.

Available-for-sale financial assets comprise equity shares.

**Non-derivative financial liabilities**

The Group initially recognises debt securities issued and subordinated liabilities on the date that they
are originated. All other financial liabilities (including liabilities designated as at fair value through profit
or loss) are recognised initially on the trade date, which is the date that the Group becomes a party to
the contractual provisions of the instrument.

The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled
or expire.

The Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities into the other financial liabilities category. Such
financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, these financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method. Other financial liabilities comprise loans and borrowings and trade and other
payables.

**Derivative financial instruments, including hedge accounting**

The Group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its interest rate risk exposures.

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value; any directly attributable transaction costs are
recognised in profit or loss as they are incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are
measured at fair value and the accounting for the changes therein depend on whether the derivative is
designated as a hedging instrument or not.

**Cash flow hedges**

When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in
fair value of the derivative is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the
hedging reserve. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised
immediately in profit or loss.

The amount accumulated in equity is retained in other comprehensive income and reclassified to profit
or loss in the same period or periods during which the hedged item affects profit or loss.

If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold,
terminated or exercised, or the designation is revoked, then hedge accounting is discontinued
prospectively. If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the amount accumulated
in equity is reclassified to profit or loss.

**Other non-trading derivatives**

When a derivative financial instrument is not designated in a hedge relationship that qualifies for hedge
accounting, all changes in its fair value are recognised immediately in profit or loss.

**3.10. Property, plant and equipment**

Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and
accumulated impairment losses.

F-107


-----

Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset and all costs
directly attributable to bringing the asset to working condition for its intended use. Such cost includes
the cost of replacing part of the plant and equipment and borrowing cost, if the recognition criteria are
met. When significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be replaced in intervals,
the Group recognises such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and depreciation,
respectively. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment less their residual
values on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives as follows:

    - Leasehold improvements 5 to 15 years—not exceeding the remaining lease terms

    - Equipment & motor vehicles 3 to 10 years

    - IT equipment 3 to 5 years

An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised, is derecognised
upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or
loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the profit or loss when the asset is
derecognised.

The assets’ residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed at each financial
period end, and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.

**3.11. Intangible fixed assets and goodwill**

**Goodwill**

Goodwill that arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries is presented with intangible assets. For the
measurement of goodwill at initial recognition, see Note 3.1.

After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. In respect of
equity-accounted investees, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the
investment, and any impairment loss is allocated to the carrying amount of the equity-accounted
investee as a whole.

**Intangible assets acquired separately**

Intangible assets that are acquired separately by the Group and have finite useful lives are measured
at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. The Group does not have
intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.

Amortisation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives from
the date that they are available for use. The amortisation expense is recognised in the consolidated
statement of comprehensive income in the “Depreciation and amortisation” caption. The estimated
useful lives are as follows:

    - Software 1 to 5 years

    - Brand name 20 years

    - Customer relationships 14 to 17 years

Amortisation methods, estimated useful lives and residual value, are reviewed at each reporting date
and adjusted if appropriate, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a
prospective basis.

**Intangible assets acquired in a business combination**

Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognised separately from goodwill are
initially recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost).

F-108


-----

Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination are measured
at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as
intangible assets that are acquired separately.

**3.12. Work in progress**

Work in progress represents the net unbilled amount expected to be collected from clients for work
performed to date. It is measured at the chargeable rate agreed with the individual clients less
progress billed.

**3.13. Impairment of assets**

**Non-derivative financial assets**

Financial assets not classified at fair value through profit or loss, including an interest in an equityaccounted investee, are assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective
evidence of impairment. A financial asset is impaired if there is objective evidence of impairment as a
result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, and that loss
event(s) had an impact on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably.

Objective evidence that financial assets are impaired includes default or delinquency by a debtor,
restructuring of an amount due to the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise,
indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy, adverse changes in the payment status of
borrowers or issuers, economic conditions that correlate with defaults or the disappearance of an
active market for a security. In addition, for an investment in an equity security, a significant or
prolonged decline in its fair value below its cost is objective evidence of impairment.

**Financial assets measured at amortised cost**

The Group considers evidence of impairment for financial assets measured at amortised cost (loans
and receivables) at both a specific asset and collective level. All individually significant assets are
assessed for specific impairment. Those found not to be specifically impaired are then collectively
assessed for any impairment that has been incurred but not yet identified.

Assets that are not individually significant are collectively assessed for impairment by grouping
together assets with similar risk characteristics.

In assessing collective impairment, the Group uses historical trends of the probability of default, the
timing of recoveries and the amount of loss incurred, adjusted for management’s judgement as to
whether current economic and credit conditions are such that the actual losses are likely to be greater
or less than suggested by historical trends.

An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the
difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows
discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. Losses are recognised in profit or loss and
reflected in an allowance account against loans and receivables. Interest on the impaired asset
continues to be recognised. When an event occurring after the impairment was recognised causes the
amount of impairment loss to decrease, the decrease in impairment loss is reversed through profit or
loss.

**Available-for-sale financial assets**

Impairment losses on available-for-sale financial assets are recognised by reclassifying the losses
accumulated in the fair value reserve in equity to profit or loss. The cumulative loss that is reclassified
from equity to profit or loss is the difference between the acquisition cost, net of any principal
repayment and amortisation, and the current fair value, less any impairment loss recognised previously
in profit or loss. Changes in cumulative impairment losses attributable to application of the effective
interest method are reflected as a component of interest income.

-----

If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of an impaired available-for-sale debt security increases and
the increase can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised,
then the impairment loss is reversed, with the amount of the reversal recognised in profit or loss.
However, any subsequent recovery in the fair value of an impaired available-for-sale equity security is
recognised in other comprehensive income.

**Non-financial assets**

The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than work in progress, current and
deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of
impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.

Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of
an asset or cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its recoverable amount.

The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less
costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present
value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of
money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU.

For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets
that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of
other assets or CGUs. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs
that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.

Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs
are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU (group of CGUs),
and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU (group of CGUs) on a pro rata
basis.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss is
reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that
would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been
recognised.

**3.14. Assets classified as held for sale**

Non-current assets, or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities, are classified as held-for-sale
if it is highly probable that they will be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing
use.

Immediately before classification as held-for-sale, the assets, or components of a disposal group, are
remeasured in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. Thereafter generally the assets, or
disposal group, are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Any
impairment loss on a disposal group is allocated first to goodwill, and then to the remaining assets and
liabilities on pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to work in progress, financial assets and
current and deferred tax assets, which continue to be measured in accordance with the Group’s
accounting policies. Impairment losses on initial classification as held-for-sale and subsequent gains
and losses on remeasurement are recognised in profit or loss. Gains are not recognised in excess of
any cumulative impairment loss.

Once classified as held-for-sale, intangible fixed assets and property, plant and equipment are no
longer amortised or depreciated, and any equity-accounted investee is no longer equity accounted.

**3.15. Share capital**

**Ordinary shares**

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary
shares are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.

F-110


-----

**Repurchase and reissue of ordinary shares (treasury shares)**

When share capital are recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid,
which includes directly attributable costs, is net of any tax effects recognised as a deduction from
equity. Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented in the treasury share
reserve. When treasury shares are sold or reissued subsequently, the amount received is recognised
as an increase in equity, and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is transferred to or from
retained earnings.

**Dividends**

Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are declared.

**3.16. Provisions**

A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive
obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be
required to settle the obligation. If the impact of time value of money is material, provisions are
determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the
discount is recognised as finance cost.

**Legal matters**

A provision for legal matters is recognised to cover the costs such as legal proceedings or legal
requirements imposed under new legislation.

**Restructuring**

A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal
restructuring plan, and the restructuring either has commenced or has been announced publicly.
Future operating losses are not provided for.

**Onerous contracts**

A provision for onerous contracts is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of
terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is
established, the Group recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with the contract.

**3.17. New standards and interpretations**

**New standards and interpretations issued but not yet adopted**

A number of amendments to existing, as well as the issue of new accounting standards are applicable
from or after the beginning of the Group’s next annual reporting period. The expected impact of these
standards is summarised below:

IFRS 9, published in July 2014, replaces existing guidance in IAS 39 Financial Instruments:
Recognition and Measurement. IFRS 9 includes revised guidance on classification and measurement
of financial instruments, including an expected credit loss model for calculating impairment on financial
assets. In addition, IFRS 9 provides a revised hedging model. All of the Group’s hedge relationships
are expected to continue under IFRS 9. The Group will implement IFRS 9 per 1 January 2018. Based
on preliminary assessments, IFRS 9 will have limited impact on its consolidated financial statements.

IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’, published in May 2014, establishes a framework
for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognised. It replaces existing guidance,
including IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS 11 ‘Construction Contracts’ and will be implemented by the Group
per 1 January 2018. The Group has made a high level impact assessment. Based on this preliminary
assessment, the Group expects that for some annual fixed fee services provided to customers, the

F-111


-----

recognition of revenue over time may not qualify anymore but instead should be recognised at a point
in time. The impact on annual reporting is expected to be limited but will be further investigated in
2017.

IFRS 16 ‘Leases’, published in January 2016, introduces a new definition of a lease and eliminates the
current dual accounting model for lessees, bringing most leases on-balance in the financial statements
of the lessee. It replaces existing guidance on leases, including IAS 17. The Group expects to
implement IFRS 16 per 1 January 2019. The Group has a significant number of operating lease
contracts (see Note 29), mainly for real estate and therefore the following changes are expected upon
transition to IFRS 16:

    - Assets and liabilities of the Group are expected to increase due to recognition of the
right-of-use asset and a lease liability.

    - Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) will increase as the
lease payments will be presented as depreciation and net finance expense rather than
operational cost. Earnings before Interest, Taxes and Amortisation (EBITA) is not expected to
materially change.

    - Operating cash flow will increase and investing and financing cash flow will decrease as the
lease payments will no longer be considered as operational.

A more detailed impact assessment will be made during 2017 and 2018.

The following new or amended standards are not expected to have a significant impact on the
consolidated financial statements:

    - Disclosure Initiative (amendments to IAS 7)

    - Recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses (amendments to IAS 12)

    - Classification and measurement of Share-based Payments (amendments to IFRS 2).

**4.** **Non IFRS Financial measures**

**4.1.** **Definitions**

    - EBITDA is defined as earnings before interests, taxes, depreciation and amortisation.

    - Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding specific items and adjusted for one-off
revenue / expenses.

    - Adjusted Revenue is defined as Revenue adjusted for one-off revenue.

    - Specific items of income or expenses are income and expenses items that, based on their
significance in size or nature, should be separately presented to provide further understanding
about the financial performance. Specific items include:

       - Transaction and monitoring costs

       - Integration costs

       - Share-based payment upon IPO

       - Income/expenses related to disposal of assets

Specific items are not of an operational nature and do not represent the core operating
results.

    - One-off revenue consists mainly of revenues related to the release of one-off provisions. The
one-off expenses are related to redundancies, legal costs and settlement fees.

    - Adjusted EBITA is defined as Adjusted EBITDA after depreciation and software amortisation.

    - Adjusted net income is defined as Adjusted EBITA less net interest costs and less tax costs.

    - Adjusted net income per share is defined as adjusted net income divided by the weightedaverage number of basic shares for the period.

**5.** **Operating segments**

**5.1.** **Basis for segmentation**

The Management Board is the Chief Operating Decision Maker of the Group (CODM). The
responsibility of the Management Board is to assess performance and to make resource allocation
decisions across the Group.

The analysis of the business is organised and managed on a geographical perspective. Operating
segments were defined as Netherlands, Luxembourg, Cayman, Guernsey and Rest of the World. All
operating segments are regarded as reportable segments due to their size/importance for the overall
understanding of the geographical business. Elian’s results from the acquisition are presented in a
separate segment defined as “Elian”.

They are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to and used by the
Management Board.

The Management Board evaluates the performance of its segments based on Adjusted Revenue and
Adjusted EBITA (“segment Adjusted Revenue” and “segment Adjusted EBITA”). Management
considers that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of the respective
segments.

The individual Adjusted EBITA by operating segment excludes the allocation of Group IT and HQ
costs, that is then deducted from the total.

Profit/(loss) before income tax is not used to measure the performance of the individual segment as
items like amortisation of intangibles (except for software) and net finance costs are not allocated to
individual segments. So the reconciliation to Profit/ (loss) before income tax according to IFRS is done
on Group level.

Consistent with the aforementioned reasoning, segment assets/liabilities are not reviewed regularly on
a segment basis by management and are therefore not included in the IFRS segment reporting.

**6.** **Acquisition of subsidiaries**

**6.1.** **Acquisition of Elian Group**

On 23 September 2016, the acquisition of Elian Group (“Elian”) from Elian’s management and funds
managed by Electra Partners LLP has been completed. Elian is a Jersey-based regional trust &
corporate services provider, specialist in Capital Markets and Private Equity & Real Estate fund
administration, with a leadership position in Jersey and a strong presence in the UK and 13 other
jurisdictions.

Elian further reinforces Intertrust’s position as the global leader in the trust and corporate services
sector by strengthening its Capital Markets and Private Equity & Real Estate Fund Administration

Services, expanding its geographical presence to jurisdictions such as Jersey, and adding scale in
other key locations like Ireland, the United Kingdom, and Cayman Islands. The combination also
enhances the career opportunities available to the combined company’s employees. Intertrust’s listed
company underscores its transparency, adds to its attractiveness as an employer and makes it the
“go-to” company for financial institutions, fund, corporations and high net worth individuals.

From acquisition to 31 December 2016, Elian contributed revenue of EUR 28,496 thousand and
Adjusted EBITA of EUR 9,726 thousand. Based on management estimates, Elian’s revenue for 2016
was GBP 92.2 million and adjusted EBITA was GBP 30.4 million.

equivalents include cash held on behalf of clients of EUR 92 thousand.

**Consideration transferred and deferred**

The total consideration of EUR 227,534 thousand includes:

(i) EUR 172,427 thousand paid to the sellers;

(ii) Settlement of forex forward contracts to fix the EUR/GBP rates for Elian acquisition of
EUR 18,613 thousand net of tax;

(iii) EUR 36,494 thousand of deferred consideration to be paid in shares 12 months and 10
business days post-closing of the acquisition.

In addition to consideration, the Group has, at the same date of the acquisition, repaid the existing
loans and borrowings of the acquired entity for EUR 322,389 thousand.

The deferred consideration of 1,803,054 shares has been recognised as an equity instrument on the
basis it represents a non-derivative bearing no contractual obligation to deliver a variable number of
the Group’s own equity instruments. The deferred consideration has been recognised at fair value as
at acquisition date (EUR 20.24 per share).

**Goodwill**

Goodwill arising from the acquisition has been recognised as follows:

The goodwill is attributable mainly to revenues from new customers and the workforce. None of the
recognised goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

**Acquisition-related costs**

The Group incurred acquisition-related costs of EUR 4,003 thousand related to external legal fees and
due diligence costs. These costs have been recognised in other operating expenses transaction &
monitoring costs (Note 9) in the Group’s consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

On 4 June 2015, the Group obtained control of CorpNordic, the leading corporate services provider in
Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland, by acquiring 100% of the shares and voting interests in the
company (CorpNordic). With this acquisition, the Group becomes the market leader of trust and
corporate services in Sweden and Denmark, and expands its network with offices in Norway and
Finland. This reinforces the Group’s successful acquisition strategy, aimed at extending its expertise
and global capabilities in the light of ongoing globalisation and the client’s increasingly complex needs.

From acquisition to 31 December 2015, CorpNordic contributed revenue of EUR 5,449 thousand and
Adjusted EBITA of EUR 960 thousand. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2015,
management estimates that revenue of the Group would have increased by EUR 5,979 thousand and
Adjusted EBITA would have increased by EUR 1,309 thousand.

All the amounts in this disclosure relate to the year 2015.

Includes specific items for share based payment upon IPO of EUR 4,119 thousand (2015: EUR 4,354
thousand) and upon integration of EUR 358 thousand (2015: nil) related to the awards made under the
equity-settled share-based payment arrangements implemented following the listing of the Company’s
shares on Euronext Amsterdam in 2015 and following Elian acquisition in 2016.

The number of FTEs (full time equivalent employees) at year end amounts to 2,359 (2015: 1,714).

**8.** **Share-based payment arrangements**

**8.1.** **Description of share-based payment arrangements**

Following the listing on Euronext Amsterdam in 2015 and Elian acquisition in 2016, the Company has
implemented and made awards to members of the Management Board and selected eligible
employees under the three equity-settled share-based payment plans:

a) Executive Ownership Plan (‘EOP’)

b) Employee Stock Ownership Plan (‘ESOP’)

c) Long term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’)

**a)** **Executive Ownership Plan**

In 2015, the members of the Management Board and selected eligible members of senior management
were invited to make a one-off investment in the Company’s shares at a share price equal to the
introduction price of one Company share on the Euronext Amsterdam at the time of the IPO. In
addition, shares representing 14% of the total investment amount were allocated to the eligible
participants for no consideration.

The grant date fair value of each of the 216,605 additional EOP shares allocated for no consideration
is equal to introduction share price at the date of listing of EUR 15.50. As there are no vesting
conditions related to the additional EOP shares, the total grant date fair value was expensed
immediately.

For each of the acquired/allocated shares, the participants were awarded the conditional right to
receive one Company share for every three EOP shares (the Matching Shares) for no consideration.
These Matching Shares will vest on the third anniversary of the IPO settlement date to the extent that
the participant still (i) holds all the EOP shares and (ii) is employed by the Company on this date. The
grant date fair value of the Matching Shares is therefore expensed over a period of 3 years starting on
the IPO settlement date.

Details of the number of Matching Shares outstanding are as follows:

**In number of shares** **2016** **2015**

**Outstanding at the beginning of the year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **515,758** **—**
Awarded during the year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . — 515,758
Forfeited during the year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -20,612 —

**Outstanding at the end of the year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **495,146** **515,758**

The Matching Shares awarded in 2015 do not entitle the participants to receive dividends during the
vesting period.

As dividends are expected during the vesting period, the grant date fair value of the Matching Shares
of EUR 14.28 is equal to the introductory share price at the date of listing of EUR 15.50 less the
discounted value of expected future dividends.

**b)** **Employee Stock Ownership Plan**

On 19 October 2015, the Management Board has made a one-time award of Company’s shares
(‘ESOP Shares’) to eligible employees, which exclude any participants in the EOP, to celebrate the
completion of the listing on Euronext Amsterdam. These ESOP Shares vested in October 2016.

On 23 September 2016, the Management Board has made a one-time award of the Company’s share
(‘ESOP Shares’) to eligible employees from Elian, to celebrate Elian and Intertrust joining forces.
These awards entitle each eligible employee to receive 100 shares for free, subject to continued
employment for a period of one year from the acquisition date. Participants are not entitled to receive
dividends during the vesting period.

Details of the number of ESOP Shares outstanding are as follows:

**In number of shares** **2016** **2015**

Outstanding at the beginning of the year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 208,780 —
Awarded during the year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 53,300 214,370
Forfeited during the year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -37,820 -5,330
Vested during the period . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -171,860 -260

**Outstanding at the end of the year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **52,400** **208,780**

As dividends are expected during the vesting period of the new ESOP shares, the grant date fair value
of the Celebration Shares of EUR 19.92 (2015: EUR 15.50) is equal to grant date share price less the
discounted value of expected future dividends.

**c)** **Long term Incentive Plan**

As referred to in the 2015 remuneration policy, the Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) was
implemented during the first half year of 2016. Conditional performance shares were awarded to
members of the Management Board and eligible members of senior management on 1 April 2016.

Performance shares are awarded an a annual basis and vest on the third anniversary of the grant date
subject to (i) the participant remaining in continuous employment during the performance period and
(ii) meeting the pre-determined performance criteria. For Management Board members, the vested
Performance shares will be subject to an additional holding period of 2 years. Participants are not
entitled to receive dividends during the vesting period.

For the first performance cycle 2016-2018, an Earnings per Share (“EPS”) growth performance target
applies. Subject to meeting the service condition, the number of LTIP Shares that vest will be between
0% (EPS growth below the threshold) and 150%. The vesting percentage is allocated linearly between
the threshold level and the maximum level.

In addition, following the acquisition of Elian, the Management Board awarded performances shares
under the LTIP to eligible Elian employees on 1 November 2016. These awards have the same vesting
conditions (including the same vesting date) as the performance shares granted on 1 April 2016.

Details of the number of LTIP Shares awarded and outstanding (at target) are as follows:

**In number of shares** **2016** **2015**

**Outstanding at the beginning of the year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **—** **—**

**Outstanding at the end of the year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **421,275** **—**

As dividends are expected during the vesting period, the grant date fair value of the performance
shares is equal to grant date share price less the discounted value of expected dividends. The
weighted-average fair value of the LTIP Shares granted in 2016 is EUR 17.82.

The Management Board EOP and LTIP awards outstanding and movements during the financial year
are disclosed in Note 32.

**14.3. Adjusted net income per share**

The Group calculates the Adjusted net income for 2016 to be EUR 113.2 million (2015:
EUR 101.4 million). Adjusted net income is defined as Adjusted EBITA, less net interest costs of
EUR 21.1 million and less tax costs of EUR 19.5 million.

Based on this Adjusted net income and taking the weighted-average number of basic shares for the
year of 88,942,943 (2015: 85,221,614), the adjusted net income per share is EUR 1.27
(2015: EUR 1.19).

The recoverable amount of goodwill has been determined for the six cash generating units as at
31 December 2016 and 2015. For each of the CGUs, the recoverable amount is higher than its
carrying amount.

**Key assumptions used in discounted cash flow projection calculations**

The recoverable amount of all CGUs has been determined based on a value-in-use calculation using
cash flow projections. The year 1 cash flow projections are based on detailed financial budget, the year
2 on detailed outlook and the years 3 to 5 on estimates, prepared by management for each cash

generating unit based on expectation of future outcomes taking into account past experience. The
revenue growth rate assumed beyond the initial 5-year period is 2.0% (2015: 2.0%), that has been
based on the expected long term inflation rate.

The values assigned to the key assumptions used in the value in use calculations are as follows for the
years 3 to 5:

    - Market growth: between 4 to 6%

    - Annual Margin Evolution: Improvement

    - Terminal value growth rate: 2%

    - Discount rate: between 9.2% to 11.9%

**Discount rate**

Discount rates represent a pre-tax measure that reflect management’s estimate of the time value of
money and the risks specific to each unit that are not already reflected in the cash flows. In determining
appropriate discount rates for each unit, regard has been given to the industry average weighted
average cost of capital. The WACC takes into account both debt and equity and converted into pre-tax
rates based in prevailing tax shields. The cost of equity is derived from the expected return on
investment by the Group’s investors. The cost of debt is determined by adding a debt risk premium to
the risk free bonds rate with a maturity of 20 years. CGU-specific risk is incorporated by applying
industry beta factors that are evaluated annually based on publicly available market data.

**Sensitivity to changes in assumptions**

Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which
recoverable amount is based would not cause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed the
recoverable amount of the CGUs.

**17.** **Investment in equity-accounted investees**

The Group’s share of profit in its equity-accounted investees for the year 2016 was a loss of
EUR 29 thousand (2015: loss of EUR 42 thousand). In 2016 and 2015 the Group did not receive any
dividend.

The Group’s equity-accounted investees are not publicly listed and consequentially do not have
published price quotations.

In 2016, as part of the Elian acquisition, the Group acquired participations in Structured Finance
Management Italia SRL and Elian Middle East B.S.C [©].

**19.1. Unrecognised deferred tax assets**

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of tax losses for EUR 7,570 thousand (2015:
EUR 7,574 thousand). Tax losses for an amount of EUR 965 thousand will expire in the next 5 years
and EUR 6,605 thousand do not expire. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of
these items because it is not probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the
Group entities can utilise the benefits.

In 2016, and in order to finance Elian acquisition, the Group entered into two new debt facilities
(through an amendment and restatement of the existing credit facilities signed on 1 October 2015)
consisting of a facility of GBP 94,000 thousand and another of EUR 147,500 thousand. In addition, the
Group did a drawdown under the multicurrency Revolver credit facility of EUR 25,000 thousand,
USD 11,500 thousand and GBP 3,500 thousand. At 31 December 2016, EUR 18,000 thousand
remains payable under the multicurrency Revolver credit facility.

On 1 October 2015, the Company and Intertrust Group B.V. entered into a syndicated senior facilities
agreement on 1 October 2015 between, among others, Intertrust Group B.V. as original borrower, the
Company as parent and original guarantor, ABN AMRO Bank N.V., Deutsche Bank AG, London
Branch, Morgan Stanley Bank International Limited and UBS Limited as mandated lead arrangers, the
financial institutions named therein as original lenders, Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. as facility
agent and security agent (the “New Facilities Agreement”).

Under the facilities agreement there is a requirement to ensure that the leverage ratio in respect of any
relevant period on or after 31 December 2015 shall not exceed 4.75:1 (stepping down to 4.50:1 on
31 December 2017 and stepping further down to 4.25:1 on 31 December 2018). For the year ended
31 December 2016 the covenant was met with a headroom of 22.9%.

The facilities agreement is guaranteed by the Company, Intertrust Group B.V. and certain of
subsidiaries; and secured by, among others, first ranking rights of pledge over all outstanding shares in
the share capital of such subsidiaries.

**Loans from shareholder**

In 2015, as part of the capital reorganisation of the Company, the amounts outstanding under the
shareholder loans of EUR 95,535 thousand, including EUR 7,016 thousand of interest expenses, were
contributed in exchange for newly issued ordinary shares of the Company.

**25.** **Employee benefits**

The Group sponsors defined benefit pension plans in the Netherlands until end 2015 and in
Switzerland. In most other countries, employees are provided with benefits under defined contribution
plans. All pension plans comply with local tax and legal restrictions in their respective country, including
funding obligations.

The Swiss pension plan is managed by an independent, legally autonomous entity which has the legal
structure of a foundation, according Swiss Federal Law on Occupational Retirement, Survivors and
Disability (LPP). All benefits in accordance with the regulations are reinsured in their entirety with an
insurance company. The foundation provides benefits on a defined contribution basis. All employees
are participants to the plan and are insured against the financial consequences of old age, disability
and death. The insurance benefits are subject to regulations, with the LPP specifying the minimum
benefits that are to be provided. The employer and employees pay contributions to the pension plan at
rates set out in the foundation rules based on a percentage of salary. The amount of the retirement
account can be taken by the employee at retirement in the form of pension or capital. The risk of
disability, death and longevity are covered by the insurance company. The insurance company invests
the vested pension capital and provides a 100% capital and interest guarantee. Even if actuarial and
investment risks are covered by an insurance company, this plan is considered under IAS 19 as a
defined benefit plan because the employer remains exposed to termination contract risks.

As of 1 January 2016 the three Dutch pension plans have changed to defined contribution pension
plans. This is taken into account as a settlement as of 31 December 2015.

The Group has also agreed to provide certain additional post-employment medical benefits to senior
employees in Curacao. These benefits are unfunded and the contributions equal the insurance
premiums paid.

The Group expects EUR 497 thousand in contributions to be paid to its defined benefit plans in 2017.

**25.5. Sensitivity analysis**

Reasonably possible changes at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions,
holding other assumptions consistent, would have affected the defined benefit obligation by the
amounts shown below:

Impact of 1 year change in the life expectancy . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 209 -96

Although the analysis does not take account of the full distribution of cash flows expected under the
plan, it does provide an approximation of the sensitivity of the assumptions shown.

All sensitivities are calculated using the same actuarial method as for the disclosed present value of
the defined benefit obligations at period-end.

**26.** **Deferred income**

Represents fixed fees invoiced to customers mainly in November-December for the next year. It drives
higher trade receivables and deferred income at the end of the period, with the deferred income
released in the following year. In some cases the fees are invoiced in advance for the complete life of
the structures resulting in non-current deferred income.

**Provision for legal matters**

Provisions for legal matters have been recognised to cover costs related to claims filed against the
Company. In some cases, this provision is limited due to the professional indemnity insurance.

**Provision for restructuring**

Provisions for restructuring have been recognised to cover costs related to i) the restructuring as a
result of the integration with Elian and CorpNordic with a balance at 31 December 2016 of
EUR 171 thousand (2014: EUR 268 thousand) and other provisions of EUR 97 thousand (2015:
EUR 241 thousand).

**Provision for onerous contracts**

Provisions for onerous contracts have been recognised for operating leases for premises that are no
longer being used by affiliates in different countries following the reorganisation after the acquisition of
Elian.

**28.** **Financial instruments**

**28.1. Financial risk management**

**Overview**

The Group has exposure to the following main risks from its financial instruments: credit risk, liquidity
risk and market risk (including currency risk and interest rate risk).

This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s
objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Group’s management of
capital.

Further information about the risk management of the Group is included in the Compliance and Risk
Management chapter of this Annual Report.

**28.2. Credit risk**

Credit risk is the risk that a counterpart will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or
customer contract, leading to a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk primarily for trade
receivables and cash at banks. Customer credit risk is managed by each of the Group entities subject
to the Group’s policy, procedures and control relating to customer credit risk management. Outstanding
customer receivables are monitored and followed up continuously. Provisions are made when there is
objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect the debts (indication that the debtor is
experiencing significant financial difficulty or default, probability of bankruptcy, problems to contact the
clients, disputes with a customer, etc.). Analysis is done on a case by case basis in line with policies.

The cash and cash equivalents and interest receivable are held mainly with banks which are rated “A-”
or higher by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services or Fitch Ratings Ltd for long term credit rating.

**Exposure to credit risk**

The gross carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum
exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was as follows:

participations in non-controlling entities and shelf companies have not been included in this analysis.

The assets that are exposed to credit risk are held 18% by The Netherlands (2015: 31%), 26.9% by
Cayman (2015: 26%), 5% by Guernsey (2015: 6%), 12.7% by Luxembourg (2015: 11%), 10.9% by
Jersey (2015: nil) and the remaining 26.5% (2015: 26%) by other jurisdictions.

Trade receivables are presented net of a provision for trade receivables. The credit risk is measured
and analysed on a local level, analysis on recoverability is done on a case by case basis in line with
policies. Evidence of historical experience demonstrates that debtors, in all ageing categories, have
high recoverability ratios.

The ageing of trade receivables and the provision for trade receivables at reporting date is disclosed
below. The movement schedule for the provision for trade receivables is included in Note 20.

**104,978** **-5,818** **85,840** **-4,844**

With respect to the trade receivables that are neither impaired nor past due, there are no indications as
of the reporting date that the debtors will not meet their payment obligations.

**28.3. Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk includes the risk to a shortage of funds and the risk to encounter difficulty in meeting
obligations associated with financial liabilities.

The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds using a recurring liquidity planning tool: global cash
flow forecasts each 3 months covering the next 6 months periods and 12 months period for the one
prepared each December.

The Group entities prepare their own cash flow forecasts and they are centrally consolidated by Group
Finance. Group Finance monitors rolling forecasts of the group’s liquidity requirements, as well as the
Group’s actual cash and receivables position to ensure that it has sufficient cash to meet operational
needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its committed borrowings facilities to ensure that the
Group does not breach borrowings limits or covenants.

The Group entities keep the amounts required for working capital management and the excess cash is
transferred to the Group Finance who defines the best use of these funds (cancellation of loans,
deposits, etc.).

Access to sourcing of funding is sufficiently available through the revolving credit facility agreement
that the Group has with banks (Note 24).

The flows expected for interest rate swaps will affect profit and loss in the same period as they are
expected to occur.

**28.4. Market risk**

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates
will affect the Group‘s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of
market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable
parameters, while optimising the return.

**Currency risk**

The Group‘s exposure to the risk of changes in exchange rates relates primarily to the Group‘s
operating activities (when revenue or expense is denominated in a different currency from the Group‘s
presentation currency). The exposures are mainly with respect to the US dollars (USD) and Pound
sterling (GBP). The loans and borrowings of the Group are denominated in Euros, Pound sterling and
US Dollars. The objective is to match the main cash flows generated by the underlying operations of
the Group with the debt which provides an economic hedge.

Until October 2015 the Group‘s investment in its Cayman subsidiary was partially hedged by two USD
denominated bank loans, one loan of USD 138 million of which USD 100 million was designated as
part of the hedge and another of USD 200 million which was fully designated as part of this hedge. Due
to the repayment of the loans in USD and the new loan in USD taken, the net investment hedge has
been redesigned: the new loan of USD 100 million is fully designated as part of this hedge. This
mitigates a portion of the foreign currency translation risk arising from the subsidiary‘s net assets.

At 31 December 2016 the face value of the designated loan is EUR 94,868 thousand. The loan is
designated as a net investment hedge. No ineffectiveness was recognised from the net investment
hedge. The Group‘s investments in other subsidiaries are not hedged.

A 10 per cent strengthening of the USD and the GBP against all other currencies at 31 December 2016
would have affected the value of financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency and
affected equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown above. This analysis assumes that all other
variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant and ignores any impact of forecast sales and
purchases.

**Interest rate risk**

The risk relates to the Group‘s long term debt obligations with floating interest rates. To manage this
risk the company enters into interest rate swaps.

Loans and borrowings hedged . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 208,460 27,556

**-586,685** **-487,001**

Financial assets mainly include cash in bank accounts with interest bearing rates.

In January 2017, the Group entered into additional interest rate swaps that will cover, together with the
existing interest rate swaps, approximately 41 % of floating interest rate on the loans and borrowings.

**Sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments**

An increase of 50 basis points in interest rates on loans and borrowings would have decreased the
profit and loss before tax by EUR 1,083 thousand (2015: EUR 2,521 thousand). A decrease of 50 basis
points in interest rates on loans and borrowings would have decreased the profit and loss before tax by
EUR 165 thousand (2015: EUR 2,521 thousand increase).

The loans and borrowings have a 0% Euribor/Libor floor, whereas the interest rate swaps do not have
a 0% floor. As a result of current negative interest rates in Euribor this causes the asymmetric
variances. The sensitivity of interest to movements in interest rates is calculated on floating rate
exposures on debt, net of interest rate swaps. This analysis assumes that all other variables remain
constant.

**28.5. Capital management**

The capital structure of the Group consists of shares and share premium and bank borrowings. The
objective of the Group‘s capital management is to ensure that it maintains healthy debt ratios in order
to support its business and face the obligations with banks.

The Group‘s target is to reach a steady state leverage ratio of between 2.0 and 2.5 times. This
leverage ratio might be higher depending on the potential and the size of any acquisitions. The bank
borrowings are subject to covenants that are tested bi-annual: Leverage ratio (Note 24).

**Level 2**

The fair value of the interest rate swaps is based on broker quotes and is calculated as the present
value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves. Fair values reflect the credit
risk of the instrument and include adjustments to take account of the credit risk of the Group entity and
counterparty when appropriate.

There are only level 2 fair values and no transfers between levels were applicable in 2016 and 2015.

During the period an amount of EUR 4,015 thousand (2015: EUR 3,377 thousand) were included in
revenues.

**30.** **Commitments**

The Group is committed to incur IT operational expenditure mainly related to managed communication
networks and outsourced activities of EUR 17,246 thousand spread in the next five years.

**31.** **Contingencies**

There are a few possible claims against the Group, the aggregate amount of which cannot be reliably
measured. Where necessary legal and/or external advice has been obtained and, in light of such
advice, the risk of litigation is provided adequately.

There is a remaining potential tax liability towards the Swiss tax authorities. This relates to a late
payment interest charge imposed by the Swiss tax authorities in the amount of CHF 9.1 million in
connection with the late payment of Swiss dividend withholding tax on a cash dividend paid in 2010 to
its former shareholders. The Group has timely filed a formal tax appeal against the imposition with the
Swiss tax authorities, outlining various arguments as to why we believe the contingency is not due. On
1 February 2017 favourable related legislation has been enacted. We expect to receive a formal full
release of the late payment interest assessment in the course of 2017 pending administrative
proceedings.

The Belgian tax authorities have delivered a notice to the third party liquidator of one of our former
subsidiaries for tax and penalties in the amount of approximately EUR 16.4 million (excluding interest)
in connection with Belgian dividend withholding tax over the payment of liquidation proceeds of this
subsidiary in 2012. The exemption for dividend withholding tax has been challenged by the tax
authorities on technical grounds. A formal tax complaint in view of full rescindment had been filed in
due course as there are good grounds to challenge the tax assessment. Following formal decision
received in February 2017, a partial rescindment for an amount of approx. EUR 6.5 million has been
obtained. An amount of approx. EUR 9.8 million (excluding interest) remains under further dispute. We
are preparing for filing a court petition as we continue to believe there to be good grounds to counter
the position taken by the tax authorities. The further treatment and outcome of the appeal in front of the
court is bound to be pending for quite some time whereby it is furthermore believed that it is still more
likely than not that a full release can be obtained.

**32.** **Related parties**

The Group has provided services to some entities related to Blackstone in the normal course of
business at arm‘s length basis.

In 2015, prior to the listing, the Group entered into transactions with parties related to Blackstone
Group for services received for advising, monitoring and transaction fees for the amount of
EUR 1,499 thousand.

In 2015, as part of the capital reorganisation of the Company, the amounts outstanding under the
shareholder loans payable to Blackstone Perpetual Topco S.à r.l. of EUR 95,535 thousand were
contributed in exchange for newly issued ordinary shares of the Company. The interest expenses in
the current period, prior to the listing, amounted to EUR 7,016 thousand.

**32.1. Parent and ultimate controlling party**

Prior to the listing in the Euronext Amsterdam on 15 October 2015, the Company was ultimately
controlled by funds managed by Blackstone Group L.P. which had the majority shareholding in the
Group. The remaining shares were owned by parties related to management. Following the IPO, the
Company is the new ultimate controlling party.

**Audit approach**

**Summary**

**Unqualified audit opinion** **Materiality**

                                   - Overall materiality of EUR 4 million

                                   - 5.5% of profit before tax from continuing
operations

**Key audit matters** **Audit scope**

 - Acquisition Accounting - Coverage of 87% of revenue

 - Valuation of Goodwill and Intangibles

 - Provisioning of Litigations and claims

 - Revenue recognition

**Materiality**

Based on our professional judgment we determined the materiality for the financial statements as a
whole at EUR 4 million (2015: EUR 3 million). The materiality is determined with reference to the 2016
profit before tax from continuing operations (5.5%). We consider profit before tax from continuing
operations as the most appropriate benchmark as it reflects the operations of the Company. We have
also taken into account misstatements and/or possible misstatements that in our opinion are material
for qualitative reasons for the users of the financial statements.

We agreed with the Supervisory Board that misstatements in excess of EUR 200,000, which are
identified during the audit, would be reported to them, as well as smaller misstatements that in our view
must be reported on qualitative grounds.

**Scope of the group audit**

Intertrust N.V. is head of a group of entities. The financial information of this group is included in the
financial statements of Intertrust N.V.

Our group audit mainly focused on group entities that were considered significant based on revenues,
leading to operating entities in the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Guernsey, Cayman Islands and Jersey
being in-scope. To increase coverage the audit for consolidation purposes was extended to include
Switzerland, Curacao and Hong Kong as well.

We have:

    - sent detailed instructions to all component auditors, covering significant areas including the
relevant risks of material misstatement and set out the information required to be reported to
the group audit team;

    - visited component locations in the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Guernsey where we
performed audit file reviews;

    - visited the Jersey operating entity and performed an audit file review in order to make use of
the work of a non-KPMG auditor of the Jersey operations 2016;

    - performed audit procedures ourselves at group entity Intertrust N.V. and the Dutch operating
entity;

    - performed audit procedures over significant accounts such as external debt, taxes and
intangible assets including goodwill ourselves at the group holding entity in the Netherlands;

By performing the procedures mentioned above at group entities, together with additional procedures
at group level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence about the group‘s
financial information to provide an opinion about the financial statements. The audit scope coverage for
2016 is 87% of the consolidated revenues.

**Our key audit matters**

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our
audit of the financial statements. We have communicated the key audit matters to the Supervisory
Board. The key audit matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters discussed.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in
forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

**Accounting for the acquisition of Elian**

**Description**

In September 2016, the Company acquired the Elian Group for EUR 227.5 million. The purchase price
allocation (PPA) as required by IFRS 3 contains complex accounting and management judgement in
significant estimates such as the future cash flow projections and discount rates used. In the PPA, the
purchase price of the acquired company‘s net assets has been allocated to all identified assets and
liabilities.

The application of purchase price accounting for the acquisition of the Elian Group has been disclosed
in note 6 of the financial statements.

**Our response**

We have performed the following audit procedures for the purchase price allocation (PPA) for Elian:

    - Audit of the opening balance for Elian Group upon acquisition performed by local auditors
based on the scoping and instructions issued;

    - Verification of the total consideration identified by the entity based on the signed agreements;

    - Assessment of the identification and valuation of all assets and liabilities acquired, including
challenging the assumptions used by management and the external valuator, engaged by the
entity, on underlying assumptions such as future cash flow projections and discount rates by
comparing them with market data;

**Our observation**

Based on our procedures performed we found that the accounting for the acquisition for the Elian
Group and related disclosure have met the requirements of IFRS 3.

**Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets**

**Description**

The company has recognised a significant amount of goodwill and intangibles for client relationships
and brand names, predominantly emanating from the acquisitions of the ATC and Intertrust businesses
amounting to EUR 1,580.5 million. There exists a potential risk of impairment of intangible assets,
including goodwill, to the extent future developments negatively deviate from the assumptions applied
during the acquisition of the group entities.

The annual impairment test performed was significant to our audit because the assessment process is
complex and judgmental and is based on assumptions that are affected by expected future economic
and market conditions. In performing the impairment testing for goodwill, the Company used various
assumptions in respect of future economic and market conditions, such as the discount rate, revenue
and margin development, expected inflation rates and the terminal value growth.

The amounts recognised, the assumptions and sensitivities used to assess the recoverable amount
recognised are disclosed in note 16 of the consolidated financial statements.

F-158


-----

**Our response**

We performed, amongst others, the following procedures:

    - We challenged management’s budget and cash flow forecasts, performing sensitivity
analyses and a retrospective review of the historical accuracy of management’s estimations;

    - Involved a KPMG valuation specialists to assist the audit team in the audit procedures
performed. The valuation specialist’s procedures included evaluating the methodology used
by management, assessing the reasonableness of the WACC, performing independent
sensitivity analyses over the key assumptions used by management in the impairment test,
and comparison with market data;

    - Assessed if management’s determination of the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) and the related
carrying value was appropriate.

**Our observation**

Based on our procedures performed we consider management’s key assumptions within an acceptable
range and determined that the company’s disclosures meet the requirements of IAS 36.

**Provisioning for litigations and claims**

**Description**

Considering the line of business of Intertrust N.V., in combination with the inherent subjectivity in
identifying, monitoring and provisioning of claims, there is a potential risk of misstatement in claim
provisions and contingency disclosures. The outcome of these matters may have a material effect on
the Company’s result and financial position. Management’s assessment of legal claims is included in
note 27 of the consolidated financial statements, and the description of contingencies is included in
note 31.

**Our response**

We performed, amongst others, the following procedures:

    - Our control testing included testing management’s controls in relation to risks of breaches in
laws and regulations, as well as testing controls over litigation and claims monitoring and
provision recognition;

    - We challenged management’s assessment of litigations and claims, and subsequent
assessment of provisions required as at the year-end with a combination of procedures
including inquiry with in-house legal counsel (at the group level and at group entities) and
substantive evidence including confirmation letters, contracts, case summaries from external
legal counsels;

**Our observation**

Based on our procedures performed we found that the provision for litigation and claims to be
recognised and as disclosed in note 3.15 of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with
IAS 37.

**Revenue recognition and risk of management override**

**Description**

Revenue recognition, in particular existence of revenue and possible fraudulent recognition, was
considered a significant inherent risk for the financial statements of Intertrust N.V. 2016 from an audit
perspective. It relates to the potential manipulation of cut-off of revenues, management override of
controls and potential bias in estimates of the recoverability of work in progress (WIP) and debtors.

Management override relevant to internal controls is an action or a series of actions performed by
management to bypass established internal controls. Management override may be driven by a desire
to reach analyst expectations.

F-159


-----

**Our response**

We addressed the risk of fraudulent revenue recognition and management override in our audit
through a combination of controls testing and substantive testing:

    - We involved KPMG forensic specialists in our fraud risk assessment and in designing audit
procedures to address the risk of fraud;

    - We tested the key controls in relation to revenue recognition, such as the approval of hours
recorded, reconciliation of written hours to contractual hours and review of proposed
invoicing;

    - We tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of the general IT controls
applicable to the system for financial reporting to the extent that this is considered effective
and efficient in our audit approach. User access management controls were not completely
implemented in Luxembourg which resulted in additional substantive audit procedures such
as manual reconciliations of data;

    - We performed substantive audit procedures in relation to cut-off of revenue. Amongst others,
we verified the timing of revenue recognition with underlying contracts and written hours,
whether credit notes issued after balance sheet date related to revenue recognised in 2016,
the existence and collectability of WIP and debtor balances by reconciling WIP to written
hours and testing the aging of accounts receivable;

    - We performed journal entry testing of both manual journal entries recorded directly in the
consolidation, and manual journal entries recorded by local management, using data analysis
tools where possible;

**Our observation**

Our audit procedures did not reveal indications of management bias or override of controls in the
estimates and accounting applied by management in relation to the recognition of revenue,
recoverability of WIP and debtors.

**Report on the other information included in the annual report**

In addition to the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon, the annual report contains other
information that consists of:

    - the Management Board’s Report on pages 4 to 120 including the Report from the Supervisory
Board;

    - other information pursuant to Part 9 of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code on pages 186 to
191.

Based on the below procedures performed, we conclude that the other information:

    - is consistent with the financial statements and does not contain material misstatements;

    - contains the information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code.

We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and understanding obtained through our
audit of the financial statements or otherwise, we have considered whether the other information
contains material misstatements.

By performing these procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 of the
Netherlands Civil Code and the Dutch Standard 720. The scope of the procedures performed is
substantially less than the scope of those performed in our audit of the financial statements.

board’s report in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code and other Information
pursuant to Part 9 of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code.

**Report on other legal and regulatory requirements**

**Engagement**

We were engaged by the General Meeting as auditor of Intertrust N.V. on 25 September 2015, as of
the audit for year of 2015, and have operated as statutory auditor since then.

**Description of the responsibilities for the financial statements**

**Responsibilities of Management Board and Supervisory Board for the financial statements**

Management Board is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements
in accordance with EU-IFRS and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code. Furthermore, the
Management Board is responsible for such internal control as Management Board determines is
necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to errors or fraud.

As part of the preparation of the financial statements, Management Board is responsible for assessing
the company‘s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting framework
mentioned, Management Board should prepare the financial statements using the going concern basis
of accounting unless Management Board either intends to liquidate the company or to cease
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Management Board should disclose events and
circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the company‘s ability to continue as a going concern
in the financial statements.

The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the company‘s financial reporting process.

**Our responsibilities for the audit of financial statements**

Our objective is to plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence for our
opinion. Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means
we may not have detected all material errors and fraud during the audit.

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate,
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of
these financial statements. The materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures
and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion.

For a further description of our responsibilities in respect of an audit of financial statements we refer to

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements**

**1.** **Reporting entity**

Intertrust N.V. (the “Company”) is a company domiciled in the Netherlands and was incorporated on
September 08, 2014. The address of the Company’s registered office is Prins Bernhardplein 200,
Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

The financial statements of the Company for the period from January 01, 2015 to December 31, 2015
comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred as the “Group” and individually as
“Group entities”) and the Group’s interest in associates.

In 2015, the Company became the parent of the Group by the contribution of the entire issued and
outstanding share capital of Intertrust Topholding (Luxembourg) S.à r.l. and the outstanding amounts
under the Shareholder loans to the Company’s shareholder’s equity as a capital contribution. The
capital contribution has been accounted for as a capital reorganisation under common control and
measured at the IFRS historical carrying values of Intertrust Topholding (Luxembourg) S.à r.l. The
consolidated financial statements are therefore presented as if the Company had been the parent
company of the Group throughout the periods presented (including 2014).

The Company began trading its shares on Euronext Amsterdam on October 15, 2015 following an
Initial Public Offering (IPO). The settlement of the IPO took place on October 19, 2015 (IPO settlement
date). The Group provides corporate and funds services, private client services and capital markets
services. At December 31, 2015, the Group has operations in 26 countries and employs 1,714 FTEs
(full time equivalent employees) (December 31, 2014: 1,523 FTEs).

**2.** **Basis of preparation**

**2.1.** **Statement of compliance**

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union for use in the EU (EU IFRS)
effective as at December 31, 2015 and in accordance with Title 9, Book 2, of the Dutch Civil Code.

These consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Management Board on
March 30, 2016. They are subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders.

**2.2.** **Basis of measurement**

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the
following material items in the consolidated statement of financial position:

    - Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value;

    - Defined benefit (assets) liabilities are recognised at the fair value of plan assets less the
present value of defined benefit obligation, as explained in Note 3.3.

**2.3.** **Functional and presentation currency**

These consolidated financial statements are presented in Euro, which is the Company’s functional
currency. All financial information presented in Euro has been rounded to the nearest thousand
(EUR 000), unless otherwise indicated.

**2.4.** **Use of estimates and judgements**

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management
to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these
estimates.

F-169


-----

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods
affected.

**Assumptions and estimation uncertainties**

Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in a
material adjustment within the next financial year is included in the following notes:

    - Note 16.1: impairment test: key assumptions underlying recoverable amounts of cash
generating units.

    - Note 25.4: measurement of defined benefit obligations: key actuarial assumptions.

    - Note 19: recognition of deferred tax assets: availability of future taxable profit against which
carry forward tax losses can be used.

    - Note 20: measurement of the allowance for impairment of trade receivables.

    - Note 27: recognition and measurement of provisions and contingencies: key assumptions
about the likelihood and magnitude of an outflow of resources.

**Determination of fair values**

A number of the Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for
both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.

When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses market observable data as
much as possible. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on
the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:

    - Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

    - Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset
or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

    - Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data
(unobservable inputs).

If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability might be categorised in different
levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the
same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire
measurement.

The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting
period during which the change has occurred.

Further information about assumptions made in measuring fair values is included in the following
notes:

    - Note 28.6 “Fair values of financial instruments”

    - Note 3.4 “Equity-settled share-based payment arrangements”

**2.5.** **Changes in accounting policies**

Except for the changes below, the Group has consistently applied the accounting policies set out in
Note 3 to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.

In the current year, the Group has applied the Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2011-2013 Cycle issued
by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) that are mandatorily effective for an
accounting period that begins on or after January 01, 2015. The adoption of these amendments to
IFRSs did not have any impact on the consolidated financial statements.

F-170


-----

**3.** **Significant accounting policies**

The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these
consolidated financial statements, and have been applied consistently by Group entities.

**3.1.** **Basis of consolidation**

**Business combinations**

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date,
which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group. The consideration transferred in the
acquisition is generally measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired. Any goodwill
that arises is tested annually for impairment. Any gain on a bargain purchase is recognised in profit or
loss immediately. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if related to the issue of debt or
equity securities.

The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing
relationships. Such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss.

Any contingent consideration payable is measured at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent
consideration is classified as equity, then it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within
equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised
in profit or loss.

**Non-controlling interests**

Non-controlling interests are measured either at their proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable
net assets or at fair value at the acquisition date. The choice of measurement is made on an
acquisition-by-acquisition basis.

Changes in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for
as equity transactions.

**Subsidiaries**

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or
has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those
returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the
consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which
control ceases.

**Loss of control**

When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the
subsidiary, and any related non-controlling interests and other components of equity. Any resulting
gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at
fair value when control is lost.

**Interests in equity-accounted investees**

The Group’s interests in equity-accounted investees comprise only interests in associates.

Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint
control, over the financial and operating policies.

Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method. They are recognised initially at
cost, which includes transactions costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated financial
statements include the Group’s share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of equityaccounted investees, after adjustments to align the accounting policies with those of the Group, from
the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.

F-171


-----

When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity-accounted investee, the carrying
amount of the investment, including any long-term interests that form part thereof, is reduced to zero,
and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an
obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee.

**Transactions eliminated on consolidation**

Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from
intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are eliminated against the
investment to the extent of the Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the
same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.

**3.2.** **Revenue**

Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group
and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration
received or receivable, excluding discounts, rebates and sales taxes or duty. Revenue is recognised in
profit or loss to the prorate part of the services rendered to the client during the reporting date. When
the Group acts in the capacity of an agent rather than as the principal in a transaction, the revenue
recognised is the net amount of commission made by the Group. Revenue comprises corporate and
fund services, private client services and capital markets services.
Revenue also includes subleasing rental income to Group clients.

**3.3.** **Employee benefits**

**Short-term employee benefits**

Short-term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised
for the amount expected to be paid if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay
this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be estimated
reliably.

**Defined contribution plans**

Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are expensed as the related service is
provided. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a
reduction in future payments is available.

**Defined benefit plans**

The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by
estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in the current and prior periods,
discounting that amount and deducting the fair value of any plan assets.

The calculation of defined benefit obligations is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the
projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a potential asset for the Group, the
recognised asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future
refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. To calculate the present value of
economic benefits, consideration is given to any minimum funding requirements that apply to any plan
in the Group. Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and
losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any,
excluding interest), are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income.

The Group determines the net interest expense (income) on the net defined benefit liability (asset) for
the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the
beginning of the annual period to the then-net defined benefit liability (asset), taking into account any

F-172


-----

changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset) during the period as a result of contributions and
benefits payments. Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are
recognised in profit or loss.

When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit
that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The Group recognises gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the
settlement occurs.

**Termination benefits**

Termination benefits are expensed at the earlier of when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of
those benefits and when the Group recognises costs for a restructuring. If benefits are not expected to
be settled wholly within 12 months of the end of the reporting period, then they are discounted.

**3.4.** **Equity-settled share-based payment arrangements**

The Company operates equity-settled share-based payment arrangements, under which services are
received from Management Board members and eligible employees.

The total amount to be expensed for services received is determined by reference to the grant date fair
value of the share-based payment awards made; including the impact of any non-vesting conditions
and market conditions.

Service conditions and non-market performance conditions are taken into account in the number of
awards expected to vest. The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line
basis over the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of the number of awards that will
eventually vest, with a corresponding credit to equity.

At each reporting date, the Company revises its estimates of the number of awards that are expected
to vest. The impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement
for the period.

The employer social security contributions payable in connection with an award made is considered an
integral part of the award, and the charge is treated as a cash-settled share-based payment
transaction.

**3.5.** **Leases**

The Group principally enters into operating leases for the rental of equipment and buildings. Payments
done under such leases are typically charged to profit or loss on a straight line basis over the period of
the lease. When an operating lease is terminated before the lease period has expired, any payment
required to be done to the lessor by way of penalty is recognised as an expense in the period in which
termination takes place. Any incentives received from the lessor in relation to operating leases are
recognised as a reduction of rental expense over the lease term on a straight line basis.

**3.6.** **Finance income and finance costs**

Finance income comprises interest income on loans and receivables, gains on the disposal of
available-for-sale financial assets, fair value gains on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
and gains on the remeasurement to fair value of any pre-existing interest in an acquiree. Interest
income is recognised as it accrues in profit or loss, using the effective interest method.

Finance costs comprise interest expenses on loans and borrowings, unwinding of the discount on
provisions and contingent consideration, losses on disposal of available-for-sale financial assets, fair
value losses on financial assets at fair value through profit and loss, impairment losses on financial
assets (other than trade receivables), gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in
profit or loss and reclassifications of amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income.

F-173


-----

Borrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a
qualifying asset are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.

Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis as either finance income or finance cost
depending on whether foreign currency movements are in a net gain or loss position.

**3.7.** **Foreign currency**

**Foreign currency transactions**

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies of Group
entities at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional
currency at the exchange rate at the reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated
in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are translated to the functional currency at the
exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items in a foreign currency
that are measured based on historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the
transaction. Foreign currency differences are generally recognised in profit or loss.

However, foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the following items are recognised
in other comprehensive income:

    - available-for-sale equity investments (except on impairment in which case foreign currency
differences that have been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to
profit or loss);

    - financial liabilities designated as hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation to the
extent that the hedge is effective; and

    - qualifying cash flow hedges to the extent the hedge is effective.

**Foreign operations**

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on
acquisition, are translated into Euro at the exchange rates at the reporting date (closing rates). The
income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into Euro at exchange rates at the dates of
the transactions.

The Group doesn’t own nor control any foreign operations in hyperinflationary economies.

Foreign currency differences are recognised in other comprehensive income, and accumulated in the
foreign currency translation reserve (translation reserve) in equity. However, if the foreign operation is
a non-wholly owned subsidiary, then the relevant proportion of the translation difference is allocated to
non-controlling interests.

When a foreign operation is disposed of such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost,
the cumulative amount in the translation reserve related to that foreign operation is reclassified to profit
or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. When the Group disposes of only part of its interest in a
subsidiary that includes a foreign operation while retaining control, the relevant proportion of the
cumulative amount is reattributed to non-controlling interests.

When the Group disposes of only part of its investment in an associate or joint venture that includes a
foreign operation while retaining significant influence or joint control, the relevant proportion of the
cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss.

When the settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither
planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, foreign currency gains and losses arising from such item
are considered to form part of a net investment in the foreign operation and are recognised in other
comprehensive income, and presented in the translation reserve in equity.

F-174


-----

**Hedge of a net investment in foreign operations**

The Group applies hedge accounting to foreign currency differences arising between the functional
currency of foreign operation and the Company’s functional currency (euro).

To the extent that the hedge is effective, foreign currency differences arising on the translation of a
financial liability designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation are recognised in
OCI and accumulated in the translation reserve. Any remaining differences are recognised in profit or
loss. When the hedged net investment is disposed of, the relevant amount in the translation reserve is
transferred to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal.

**3.8.** **Income tax**

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax is recognised in
profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly
in equity or in other comprehensive income.

**Current tax**

Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the period,
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax
payable in respect of previous years.

**Deferred tax**

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax
is not recognised for:

    - temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is
not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;

    - temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities to
the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and

    - taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences
when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax
liabilities and assets, and they relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable
entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net
basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.

A deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary
differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available, against which
they can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the
extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. Unrecognised deferred
tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become
probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

**3.9.** **Financial instruments**

**Non-derivative financial assets**

The Group initially recognises loans and receivables and deposits on the date that they are originated.
All other financial assets (including assets designated as at fair value through profit or loss) are
recognised initially on the trade date, which is the date that the Group becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.

F-175


-----

The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset
expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred. Any interest
in such transferred financial asset that is created or retained by the Group is recognised as a separate
asset or liability.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the consolidated statement
of financial position if, and only if, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either
to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

The Group classifies non-derivative financial assets into the following categories: financial assets at fair
value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity financial assets, loans and receivables and
available-for-sale financial assets.

**Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss**

A financial asset is classified as at fair value through profit or loss if it is classified as held for trading or
is designated as such on initial recognition. Financial assets are designated as at fair value through
profit or loss if the Group manages such investments and makes purchase and sale decisions based
on their fair value in accordance with the Group’s documented risk management or investment
strategy. Attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Financial assets at
fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value and changes therein, which take into
account any dividend income, are recognised in profit or loss.

The Group has not designated any financial assets upon initial recognition as at fair value through
profit or loss.

**Loans and receivables**

Loans and receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in
an active market. Such assets are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable
transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and receivables are measured at amortised
cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.

Loans and receivables comprise cash and cash equivalents, client’s funds held in cash, loans, trade
receivables and other receivables.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances bank accounts, cash on hand and cash in shortterm deposits with maturities of three months or less.

**Available-for-sale financial assets**

Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available
for sale, or are not classified in any of the above categories of financial assets. Available-for-sale
financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs.

Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes therein, other than
impairment losses and foreign currency differences on available-for-sale debt instruments, are
recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the fair value reserve in equity. When an
investment is derecognised, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is reclassified to profit or loss.

When investments in equity instruments do not have a quoted market price in an active market and its
fair value cannot be reliably they measured are measured at cost.

Available-for-sale financial assets comprise equity shares.

F-176


-----

**Non-derivative financial liabilities**

The Group initially recognises debt securities issued and subordinated liabilities on the date that they
are originated. All other financial liabilities (including liabilities designated as at fair value through profit
or loss) are recognised initially on the trade date, which is the date that the Group becomes a party to
the contractual provisions of the instrument.

The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled
or expire.

The Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities into the other financial liabilities category. Such
financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, these financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method. Other financial liabilities comprise loans and borrowings and trade and other
payables.

**Derivative financial instruments, including hedge accounting**

The Group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its interest rate risk exposures.

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value; any directly attributable transaction costs are
recognised in profit or loss as they are incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are
measured at fair value and the accounting for the changes therein depend on whether the derivative is
designated as a hedging instrument or not.

**Cash flow hedges**

When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in
fair value of the derivative is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the
hedging reserve. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised
immediately in profit or loss.

The amount accumulated in equity is retained in other comprehensive income and reclassified to profit
or loss in the same period or periods during which the hedged item affects profit or loss.

If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold,
terminated or exercised, or the designation is revoked, then hedge accounting is discontinued
prospectively. If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the amount accumulated
in equity is reclassified to profit or loss.

**Other non-trading derivatives**

When a derivative financial instrument is not designated in a hedge relationship that qualifies for hedge
accounting, all changes in its fair value are recognised immediately in profit or loss.

**3.10. Property, plant and equipment**

Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and
accumulated impairment losses.

Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset and all costs
directly attributable to bringing the asset to working condition for its intended use. Such cost includes
the cost of replacing part of the plant and equipment and borrowing cost, if the recognition criteria are
met. When significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be replaced in intervals,
the Group recognises such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and depreciation,
respectively. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

F-177


-----

Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment less their residual
values on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives as follows:

    - Leasehold improvements 5 to 15 years—not exceeding the remaining lease terms

    - Equipment & motor vehicles 3 to 10 years

    - IT equipment 3 to 5 years

An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised, is derecognised
upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or
loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the profit or loss when the asset is
derecognised.

The assets’ residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed at each financial
period end, and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.

**3.11. Intangible fixed assets and goodwill**

**Goodwill**

Goodwill that arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries is presented with intangible assets. For the
measurement of goodwill at initial recognition, see Note 3.1.

After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. In respect of
equity-accounted investees, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the
investment, and any impairment loss is allocated to the carrying amount of the equity-accounted
investee as a whole.

**Intangible assets acquired separately**

Intangible assets that are acquired separately by the Group and have finite useful lives are measured
at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. The Group does not have
intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.

Amortisation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives from
the date that they are available for use. The amortisation expense is recognised in the consolidated
statement of comprehensive income in the “Depreciation and amortisation” caption. The estimated
useful lives are as follows:

    - Software 1 to 5 years

    - Brand name 20 years

    - Customer relationships 14 to 17 years

Amortisation methods, estimated useful lives and residual value, are reviewed at each reporting date
and adjusted if appropriate, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a
prospective basis.

**Internally-generated intangible assets—research and development expenditure**

Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. An
internally-generated intangible asset arising from development (or from the development phase of an
internal project) is recognised if, and only if, all of the following have been demonstrated:

    - the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or
sale;

F-178


-----

    - the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;

    - the ability to use or sell the intangible asset;

    - how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits;

    - the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the
development and to use or sell the intangible asset; and

    - the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its
development.

The amount initially recognised for internally-generated intangible assets is the sum of the expenditure
incurred from the date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria listed above.

Subsequent to initial recognition, internally-generated intangible assets are measured at cost less
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets
that are acquired separately.

**Intangible assets acquired in a business combination**

Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognised separately from goodwill are
initially recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost).

Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination are measured
at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as
intangible assets that are acquired separately.

**3.12. Work in progress**

Work in progress represents the net unbilled amount expected to be collected from clients for work
performed to date. It is measured at the chargeable rate agreed with the individual clients less
progress billed.

**3.13. Impairment of assets**

**Non-derivative financial assets**

Financial assets not classified at fair value through profit or loss, including an interest in an equityaccounted investee, are assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective
evidence of impairment. A financial asset is impaired if there is objective evidence of impairment as a
result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, and that loss
event(s) had an impact on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably.

Objective evidence that financial assets are impaired includes default or delinquency by a debtor,
restructuring of an amount due to the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise,
indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy, adverse changes in the payment status of
borrowers or issuers, economic conditions that correlate with defaults or the disappearance of an
active market for a security. In addition, for an investment in an equity security, a significant or
prolonged decline in its fair value below its cost is objective evidence of impairment.

**Financial assets measured at amortised cost**

The Group considers evidence of impairment for financial assets measured at amortised cost (loans
and receivables) at both a specific asset and collective level. All individually significant assets are
assessed for specific impairment. Those found not to be specifically impaired are then collectively
assessed for any impairment that has been incurred but not yet identified.

Assets that are not individually significant are collectively assessed for impairment by grouping
together assets with similar risk characteristics.

F-179


-----

In assessing collective impairment, the Group uses historical trends of the probability of default, the
timing of recoveries and the amount of loss incurred, adjusted for management’s judgement as to
whether current economic and credit conditions are such that the actual losses are likely to be greater
or less than suggested by historical trends.

An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the
difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows
discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. Losses are recognised in profit or loss and
reflected in an allowance account against loans and receivables. Interest on the impaired asset
continues to be recognised. When an event occurring after the impairment was recognised causes the
amount of impairment loss to decrease, the decrease in impairment loss is reversed through profit or
loss.

**Available-for-sale financial assets**

Impairment losses on available-for-sale financial assets are recognised by reclassifying the losses
accumulated in the fair value reserve in equity to profit or loss. The cumulative loss that is reclassified
from equity to profit or loss is the difference between the acquisition cost, net of any principal
repayment and amortisation, and the current fair value, less any impairment loss recognised previously
in profit or loss. Changes in cumulative impairment losses attributable to application of the effective
interest method are reflected as a component of interest income.

If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of an impaired available-for-sale debt security increases and
the increase can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised,
then the impairment loss is reversed, with the amount of the reversal recognised in profit or loss.
However, any subsequent recovery in the fair value of an impaired available-for-sale equity security is
recognised in other comprehensive income.

**Non-financial assets**

The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than work in progress, current and
deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of
impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.

Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of
an asset or cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its recoverable amount.

The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less
costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present
value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of
money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU.

For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets
that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of
other assets or CGUs. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs
that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.

Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs
are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU (group of CGUs),
and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU (group of CGUs) on a pro rata
basis.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss is
reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that
would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been
recognised.

**3.14. Assets classified as held for sale**

Non-current assets, or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities, are classified as held-for-sale
if it is highly probable that they will be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing
use.

Immediately before classification as held-for-sale, the assets, or components of a disposal group, are
remeasured in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. Thereafter generally the assets, or
disposal group, are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Any
impairment loss on a disposal group is allocated first to goodwill, and then to the remaining assets and
liabilities on pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to work in progress, financial assets and
current and deferred tax assets, which continue to be measured in accordance with the Group’s
accounting policies. Impairment losses on initial classification as held-for-sale and subsequent gains
and losses on remeasurement are recognised in profit or loss. Gains are not recognised in excess of
any cumulative impairment loss.

Once classified as held-for-sale, intangible fixed assets and property, plant and equipment are no
longer amortised or depreciated, and any equity-accounted investee is no longer equity accounted.

**3.15. Provisions**

A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive
obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be
required to settle the obligation. If the impact of time value of money is material, provisions are
determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the
discount is recognised as finance cost.

**Legal matters**

A provision for legal matters is recognised to cover the costs such as legal proceedings or legal
requirements imposed under new legislation.

**Restructuring**

A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal
restructuring plan, and the restructuring either has commenced or has been announced publicly.
Future operating losses are not provided for.

**Onerous contracts**

A provision for onerous contracts is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of
terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is
established, the Group recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with the contract.

have a significant impact of the Group consolidated financial statements.

**4.** **Non IFRS Financial measures**

**4.1.** **Definitions**

    - EBITDA is defined as earnings before interests, taxes, depreciation and amortisation.

    - Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding specific items and adjusted for one-off
revenue/expenses.

    - Adjusted Revenue is defined as Revenue adjusted for one-off revenue.

    - Specific items of income or expenses are income and expenses items that, based on their

       - Transaction and monitoring costs

       - Integration costs

       - Share-based payment upon IPO

       - Income/expenses related to disposal of assets

F-182

Specific items are not of an operational nature and do not represent the core operating
results.

    - One-off revenue consists mainly of revenues related to the release of one-off provisions. The
one-off expenses are related to redundancies, legal costs and settlement fees.

    - Adjusted EBITA is defined as Adjusted EBITDA after depreciation and software amortisation.

    - Adjusted net income is defined as Adjusted EBITA less proforma post IPO interest cost less
18% proforma taxes.

    - Adjusted net income per share is defined as adjusted net income divided by the number of
shares outstanding as of 31 December.

**5.** **Operating segments**

**5.1.** **Basis for segmentation**

The Management Board is the Chief Operating Decision Maker of the Group (CODM). The
responsibility of the Management Board is to assess performance and to make resource allocation
decisions across the Group.

The analysis of the business is organised and managed on a geographical perspective. Operating
segments are defined as Netherlands, Luxembourg, Cayman, Guernsey and Rest of the World. All
operating segments are regarded as reportable segments due to their size/importance for the overall
understanding of the geographical business.

They are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to and used by the
Management Board.

The Management Board evaluates the performance of its segments based on Adjusted Revenue and
Adjusted EBITA (“segment Adjusted Revenue” and “segment Adjusted EBITA”). Management
considers that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of the respective
segments.

**Adjusted Revenue . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **344,854** **295,864**

The individual Adjusted EBITA by operating segment excludes the allocation of Group IT and HQ
costs, that is then deducted from the total.

Profit/(loss) before income tax is not used to measure the performance of the individual segment as
items like amortisation of intangibles (except for software) and net finance costs are not allocated to
individual segments. So the reconciliation to Profit/(loss) before income tax according to IFRS is done
on Group level.

Consistent with the aforementioned reasoning, segment assets/liabilities are not reviewed regularly on
a segment basis by management and are therefore not included in the IFRS segment reporting.

(*) Group IT and HQ costs are not allocated by operating segment

As of January 01, 2015, all local IT costs have been reallocated to group IT. The aim of this
centralization was to support infrastructure and business projects and to have a better control of IT
expenses. If applied to 2014, the Group IT costs at the end of December 2014 would have increased
by EUR 4,117 thousand and therefore the other segments would have had an improvement in EBITA
for the same amount.

In 2014 the segments to measure the performance of the Group were “Adjusted Revenue” and
“Adjusted EBITDA”. In 2015 “Adjusted EBITDA” was replaced by “Adjusted EBITA” so 2014 figures
have been aligned accordingly.

One-off expenses include the offset of the income related to the settlement of the defined benefit
pension plan in the Netherlands (Note 7).

**5.5.** **Entity-wide disclosures**

Management does not distinguish between revenue streams resulting from different products or
services. Therefore no further split of revenues is presented.

There is no single customer amounting to 10% or more of Group’s revenues.

**6.** **Acquisition of subsidiaries**

On June 04, 2015, the Group obtained control of CorpNordic, the leading corporate services provider
in Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland, by acquiring 100% of the shares and voting interests in the
company (CorpNordic). With this acquisition, the Group becomes the market leader of trust and
corporate services in Sweden and Denmark, and expands its network with offices in Norway and
Finland. This reinforces the Group’s successful acquisition strategy, aimed at extending its expertise
and global capabilities in the light of ongoing globalization and the client’s increasingly complex needs.

From acquisition to December 31, 2015, CorpNordic contributed revenue of EUR 5,449 thousand and
Adjusted EBITA of EUR 960 thousand. If the acquisition had occurred on January 01, 2015,
management estimates that revenue of the Group would have increased by EUR 5,979 thousand and
Adjusted EBITA would have increased by EUR 1,309 thousand.

**6.1.** **Identifiable asset acquired and liabilities assumed**

**6.2.** **Consideration transferred**

The consideration of EUR 23,928 thousand was paid in cash. In addition to consideration transferred,
the Group has, at the same date of the acquisition, repaid the existing loans and borrowings of the
acquired entity for EUR 1,545 thousand.

**6.3.** **Goodwill**

Goodwill arising from the acquisition has been recognised as follows:

The goodwill is attributable mainly to work force, synergies and cross selling business opportunities
expected to be achieved from the integration of the company into the Group’s business. None of the
recognised goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

**6.4.** **Acquisition-related costs**

The Group incurred acquisition-related costs of EUR 667 thousand related to external legal fees and
due diligence costs. These costs have been recognised in other operating expenses transaction &
monitoring costs (Note 9) in the Group’s consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

Pension and benefits includes defined contributions of EUR 5,058 thousand (2014: EUR 4,484
thousand), defined benefits amounting to EUR 1,521 thousand (2014: EUR 665 thousand) and an
income of EUR 6,706 thousand related to the settlement of pension plan in the Netherlands due to the
change from a defined benefits plan to a defined contribution scheme.

Share-based payment upon IPO includes expenses of EUR 4,354 thousand recognised in 2015 related
to the awards made under the equity-settled share-based payment arrangements implemented
following the listing of the Company’s shares on Euronext Amsterdam (Note 8).

Other personnel expenses includes mainly external and temporary staff, training expenses, work
permits and medical costs.

The number of FTEs (full time equivalent employees) at year end amounts to 1,714 (2014: 1,523).

**8.1.** **Description of share-based payment arrangements**

Following the listing on Euronext Amsterdam, the Company has implemented and made awards to
members of the Management Board and selected eligible employees under the two equity-settled
share-based payment plans operated during 2015:

a) Executive Ownership Plan (EOP)

b) Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)

F-186


-----

**a)** **Executive Ownership Plan**

The members of the Management Board and selected eligible members of senior management were
invited to make a one-off investment in the Company’s shares at a share price equal to the introduction
price of one Company share on the Euronext Amsterdam at the time of the IPO. In addition, shares
representing 14% of the total investment amount were allocated to the eligible participants for no
consideration.

The grant date fair value of each of the 216,605 additional EOP shares allocated for no consideration
is equal to introduction share price at the date of listing of EUR 15.50. As there are no vesting
conditions related to the additional EOP shares, the total grant date fair value was expensed
immediately.

For each of the acquired/allocated shares, the participants were awarded the conditional right to
receive one Company share for every three EOP shares (the Matching Shares) for no consideration.
These Matching Shares will vest on the third anniversary of the IPO settlement date to the extent that
the participant still (i) holds all the EOP shares and (ii) is employed by the Company on this date. The
grant date fair value of the Matching Shares is therefore expensed over a period of 3 years starting on
the IPO settlement date.

Details of the number of Matching Shares outstanding are as follows:

**In number of shares** **2015** **2014**

**Outstanding at the beginning of the year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **—** **—**
Awarded during the year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 515,758 —

**Outstanding at the end of the year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **515,758** **—**

The grant date fair value of the Matching Shares of EUR 14.28 has been determined with reference to
the introductory share price at the date of listing of EUR 15.50. In addition, the following conditions
have been considered when measuring the fair value of the Matching shares:

    - In order to become entitled to the Matching Shares, the EOP shares are blocked and cannot
be sold or pledged during the vesting period of 3 years from the IPO settlement date.

    - For the Management Board members, the vested Matching Shares are subject to an
additional holding period of 2 years.

    - The Matching Shares do not entitle the participants to receive dividends during the vesting
period.

As dividends are expected during the vesting period, the grant date fair value of the Matching Shares
of EUR 14.28 is equal to introductory share price at the date of listing of EUR 15.50 less the
discounted value of expected future dividends.

The 2015 Management Board EOP awards outstanding and movements during the financial year are
disclosed in Note 32.

**b)** **Employee Stock Ownership Plan**

The Management Board has made a one-time award of Company’s shares (ESOP Shares) to eligible
employees, which exclude any participants in the EOP, to celebrate the completion of the listing on
Euronext Amsterdam. These awards entitle each eligible employee to receive 130 shares for free,
subject to continued employment for a period of one year from the IPO settlement date.

Details of the number of ESOP Shares outstanding are as follows:

**In number of shares** **2015** **2014**

**Outstanding at the beginning of the year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **—** **—**
Awarded during the year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 214,370 —

**Outstanding at the end of the year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **208,780** **—**

As no dividends are expected during the one-year vesting period and no market or non-vesting
conditions apply, the grant date fair value an ESOP Share is equal to introductory share price at the
date of listing of EUR 15.50, and is expensed over one year service period from the IPO settlement
date.

**8.2.** **Expenses recognised during the period**

The equity-settled share-based payment expenses recognised during the period, with a corresponding
entry directly in equity, per plan and in total are as follows:

**(EUR 000)** **2015** **2014**

Executive Ownership Plan . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3,744 —
Employee Stock Ownership Plan . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 558 —

**Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **4,302** **—**

In addition, the Group recognised expenses of EUR 52 thousand for employer social security
contributions payable in connection with the awards made in 2015.

The previous Management Employees Participation Plan (the MEP) in which eligible key employees
and managers of the Group were participating equity instruments of the Group prior the IPO, has been
unwound pursuant to the completion of the IPO. As a consequence, the equity interests of eligible
employees under the MEP have been exchanged for a number of listed shares in the Company and
cash. As the settlement of the MEP interests was based on the same exchange proportion as other
shareholders or in cash equal to the fair value of the underlying instruments, the settlement of the
interests under the MEP does not result in any additional employee benefit expenses to be recognised.

Due to the changes in the capital structure post-IPO, the Group prepared an estimation of the Adjusted
earnings per share for purposes of comparability going forward.

The Group estimates the Adjusted net income for 2015 to be EUR 101.4 million. Adjusted net income
is defined as Adjusted EBITA, less proforma post-IPO annual interest costs of EUR 16.7 million and
with a proforma effective tax rate of 18%. Adjusted net income thus reflects the post-IPO capital
structure.

Based on this Adjusted net income and taking the number of shares outstanding as of December 31,
2015 of 85,221,614, the adjusted net income per share was estimated in EUR 1.19.

The recoverable amount of goodwill has been determined for the five cash generating units as
at December 31, 2015 and 2014. For each of the CGUs, the recoverable amount is higher than
its carrying amount.

**Key assumptions used in discounted cash flow projection calculations**

The recoverable amount of all CGUs has been determined based on a value-in-use calculation using
cash flow projections. The years 1 and 2 cash flow projections are based on detailed financial budgets
and the years 3 to 5 on estimates, prepared by management for each cash generating unit based on
expectation of future outcomes taking into account past experience. For the Netherlands and for
Luxembourg, the revenue growth rates between 2018 and 2020 have been assumed to slightly
outgrow the expected market growth. For Cayman, the revenue growth has been assumed to have a
modest decline versus the market growth. Market growth for the period 2018 to 2020 has been
assumed to be the same as the growth for the period 2014 to 2018. The revenue growth rate assumed
beyond the initial 5-year period is 2.0% (2014: 2.0%), that has been based on the expected long term
inflation rate.

The values assigned to the key assumptions used in the value in use calculations are as follows for the
years 3 to 5:


**Discount**
**rate**


**Terminal value**
**growth rate**


**CGU** **Market growth**


**Annual Margin**
**Evolution**


The Netherlands . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4% Improvement 10.7% 2%
Luxembourg . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8% Improvement 11.1% 2%
Cayman . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6% Stable 9.2% 2%

**Discount rate**

Discount rates represent a pre-tax measure that reflect management’s estimate of the time value of
money and the risks specific to each unit that are not already reflected in the cash flows. In determining
appropriate discount rates for each unit, regard has been given to the industry average weighted
average cost of capital. The WACC takes into account both debt and equity. The cost of equity is

F-194


-----

derived from the expected return on investment by the Group’s investors. The cost of debt is
determined by adding a debt risk premium to the risk free bonds rate with a maturity of 20 years.
CGU-specific risk is incorporated by applying industry beta factors that are evaluated annually based
on publicly available market data.

**Sensitivity to changes in assumptions**

Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which
recoverable amount is based would not cause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed the
recoverable amount of the CGUs.

**17.** **Investment in equity-accounted investees**

The Group’s share of profit in its equity-accounted investees for the year 2015 was a loss of EUR
42 thousand (2014: loss of EUR 16 thousand). In 2015 and 2014 the Group did not receive any
dividend.

The Group’s equity-accounted investees are not publicly listed and consequentially do not have
published price quotations.

-----

On the December 29, 2015, the Group entered into a new interest rate swap to manage the interest
rate fluctuations exposures on the new USD loan. The notional amount of the swaps is USD
30,000 thousand, covering the floating rate of interest payments on 30% of the nominal value of the
USD loans. For risk exposure refer to Note 28.4.

The hedges were assessed to be effective at December 31, 2015 and 2014. For valuation technique
used, refer to Note 28.6.

**Loans**

In 2014, the figures included an amount of EUR 968 thousand related to loans with financial institutions
to finance legacy yacht activities. They were non-interest bearing loans with the respective offsetting
receivables shown in “Other financial assets—Loans”.

**19.** **Deferred tax assets and liabilities**

**19.1. Unrecognised deferred tax assets**

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of tax losses for EUR 7,574 thousand (2014:
EUR 7,090 thousand). Tax losses for an amount of EUR 910 thousand will expire in the next 5 years
and EUR 6,664 thousand do not expire. In addition there is an amount of EUR 8,316 thousand (2014:
EUR 8,066 thousand) of unused tax credits not recognised in relation to withholding tax that can be
offset against future corporate income tax. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of
these items because it is not probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the
Group entities can utilise the benefits.

**19.2. Recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities**

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are attributable to the following:

**20.** **Trade receivables**

Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally on 30 day terms. The Group believes that
the unimpaired amounts that are past due by more than 30 days are still collectible, based on historic
payment behaviour and analysis of the customers situation.

As at December 31, 2015, the ageing analysis of trade receivables net of the allowance for impairment
is as follows:

**(EUR 000)** **31.12.2015** **31.12.2014**

In 2015, the Group refinanced the Senior Facilities and the Second Lien Facilities using a combination
of proceeds from the primary offering and a drawdown from the new facilities (as described below).

The Company and Intertrust Group B.V. entered into a syndicated senior facilities agreement on
October 01, 2015 between, among others, Intertrust Group B.V. as original borrower, the Company as
parent and original guarantor, ABN AMRO Bank N.V., Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, Morgan
Stanley Bank International Limited and UBS Limited as mandated lead arrangers, the financial
institutions named therein as original lenders, Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. as facility agent and
security agent (the “New Facilities Agreement”).

The new facilities agreement governs the new facilities which consist of a multicurrency revolving credit
facility in the aggregate amount of EUR 75 million (the “New Revolving Facility”), a euro base currency
term loan facility in the aggregate amount of EUR 440 million and a USD dollar base currency term
loan facility in the aggregate amount of USD 100 million.

Under the new facilities agreement there is a requirement to ensure that the leverage ratio in respect of
any relevant period on or after December 31, 2015 shall not exceed 4.75:1 (stepping down to 4.50:1 on
December 31, 2017 and stepping further down to 4.25:1 on
December 31, 2018). For the year ended December 31, 2015 the covenant was met with a headroom
of 35%.

The new facilities agreement is guaranteed by the Company, Intertrust Group B.V. and certain of
subsidiaries; and secured by, among others, first ranking rights of pledge over all outstanding shares in
the share capital of such subsidiaries.

**Loans from shareholder**

As part of the capital reorganisation of the Company, the amounts outstanding under the shareholder
loans of EUR 95,535 thousand, including EUR 7,016 thousand of interest expenses in the current
period, were contributed in exchange for newly issued ordinary shares of the Company.

**25.** **Employee benefits**

The Group sponsors defined benefit pension plans in the Netherlands until end 2015 and in
Switzerland. In most other countries, employees are provided with benefits under defined contribution
plans. All pension plans comply with local tax and legal restrictions in their respective country, including
funding obligations.

The Swiss pension plan is managed by an independent, legally autonomous entity which has the legal
structure of a foundation, according Swiss Federal Law on Occupational Retirement, Survivors and
Disability (LPP). All benefits in accordance with the regulations are reinsured in their entirety with an
insurance company. The foundation provides benefits on a defined contribution basis. All employees
are participants to the plan and are insured against the financial consequences of old age, disability
and death. The insurance benefits are subject to regulations, with the LPP specifying the minimum
benefits that are to be provided. The employer and employees pay contributions to the pension plan at
rates set out in the foundation rules based on a percentage of salary. The amount of the retirement
account can be taken by the employee at retirement in the form of pension or capital. The risk of
disability, death and longevity are covered by the insurance company. The insurance company invests
the vested pension capital and provides a 100% capital and interest guarantee. Even if actuarial and
investment risks are covered by an insurance company, this plan is considered under IAS 19 as a
defined benefit plan because the employer remains exposed to termination contract risks.

The Dutch pension scheme relates to three defined benefit plans funded by contributions made by both
employer and employee, where contributions are expressed as a percentage of the pensionable
salary. The retirement benefits are determined on two plans on a final pay system with an accrual rate
of 1.657% (2014: 1,75%). In the 3rd plan, retirement benefits are determined on an average pay
system with an accrual rate of 1.75%. Indexation of vested benefits for all plans is conditional on
available means stemming from the indexation accounts. As of January 01, 2016 the three pension
plans will change to defined contribution pension plans. This is taken into account as a settlement as of
December 31, 2015.

The Group has also agreed to provide certain additional post-employment medical benefits to senior
employees in Curaçao. These benefits are unfunded and the contributions equal the insurance
premiums paid.

The Group expects EUR 537 thousand in contributions to be paid to its defined benefit plans in 2016.

As of January 01, 2015, the accrual rate used to determine the final pay system of two pension plans in
the Netherlands changed to 1.657% instead of 1.75%. In Switzerland, the pension plan communicated
in October 2015 a reduction in the conversion rate for supplementary retirement savings in several
steps until 2020 with its first effects taking place by January 01, 2017. These changes were accounted
for as a past service cost in “Staff expenses”.

The reduction in the pension defined liability is explained by the change of the plans into defined
contribution in the Netherlands as of January 01, 2016. This change was accounted for as settlement
as of December 31, 2015 in “Staff expenses”.

**25.5. Sensitivity analysis**

Reasonably possible changes at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions,
holding other assumptions consistent, would have affected the defined benefit obligation by the
amounts shown below:

**(EUR 000)** **Increase** **Decrease**

**2015**
Impact of 1% change in the discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -1,506 2,194

Impact of 1% change in the medical cost trend rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 52 -45
Impact of 1 year change in the life expectancy . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 209 -96
**2014**
Impact of 1% change in the discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -6,314 9,219
Impact of 1% change in the future salary increases . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4,226 -3,459
Impact of 1% change in the future pension increases . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5,962 -3,880

Impact of 1 year change in the life expectancy . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 541 -549

Although the analysis does not take account of the full distribution of cash flows expected under the
plan, it does provide an approximation of the sensitivity of the assumptions shown.

All sensitivities are calculated using the same actuarial method as for the disclosed present value of
the defined benefit obligations at period-end.

**26.** **Deferred income**

Represents fixed fees invoiced to customers mainly in November-December for the next year. It drives
higher trade receivables and deferred income at the end of the period, with the deferred income
released in the following year. In some cases the fees are invoiced in advance for the complete life of
the structures resulting in non-current deferred income.

**Provision for legal matters**

Provisions for legal matters have been recognised to cover costs related to claims filed against the
Company. In some cases, this provision is limited due to the professional indemnity insurance.

**Provision for restructuring and restructuring due to integration**

Provisions for restructuring have been recognised to cover costs related to i) the restructuring as a
result of the integration with CorpNordic with a balance at December 31, 2015 of EUR 268 thousand
(2014: nil), ii) the remaining provision related to the integration with ATC of EUR 70 thousand has been
reversed at December 31, 2015, iii) the closing of the cash rich companies business for
EUR 167 thousand (2014: EUR 345 thousand) and iv) other provisions of EUR 74 thousand.

**Onerous contracts**

Provisions for onerous contracts have been recognised for operating leases for premises that are no
longer being used by affiliates in different countries following the reorganisation after the acquisition of
ATC. Provisions have been used according to the plan. Additional provision has been recognised at
December 31, 2015 for 2016 rental expenses and charges for offices that were initially expected to be
subleased for EUR 1,002 thousand.

**28.** **Financial instruments**

**28.1. Financial risk management**

**Overview**

The Group has exposure to the following main risks from its financial instruments: credit risk, liquidity
risk and market risk (including currency risk and interest rate risk).

This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s
objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Group’s management of
capital.

Further information about the risk management of the Group is included in the section “Risk
management” of the annual report.

**28.2. Credit risk**

Credit risk is the risk that a counterpart will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or
customer contract, leading to a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk primarily for trade
receivables and cash at banks. Customer credit risk is managed by each of the Group entities subject
to the Group’s policy, procedures and control relating to customer credit risk management. Outstanding
customer receivables are monitored and followed up continuously. Provisions are made when there is
objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect the debts (indication that the debtor is
experiencing significant financial difficulty or default, probability of bankruptcy, problems to contact the
clients, disputes with a customer, etc.). Analysis is done on a case by case basis in line with policies.

The cash and cash equivalents and interest receivable are held mainly with banks which are rated “A-”
or higher by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services or Fitch Ratings Ltd for long term credit rating.

**Exposure to credit risk**

The gross carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum
exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was as follows:

**205,108** **158,133**

The “Other financial assets” of EUR 988 thousand (2014: EUR 962 thousand) related to the
participations in non-controlling entities and shelf companies have not been included in this analysis. In
2014, EUR 968 thousand structured under back to back transactions were also excluded.

The assets that are exposed to credit risk are held 31% by the Netherlands, 26% by Cayman, 6% by
Guernsey, 11% by Luxembourg and the remaining 26% by other jurisdictions.

Work in progress represents the net unbilled amount expected to be invoiced and collected from clients
for work performed to date. It is measured at the chargeable rate agreed with the individual clients less
progress billed.

**Impairment losses**

The ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date and the movement in the allowance for
impairments in respect of trade receivables are detailed in Note 20.

**28.3. Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk includes the risk to a shortage of funds and the risk to encounter difficulty in meeting
obligations associated with financial liabilities.

The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds using a recurring liquidity planning tool: global cash
flow forecasts each 3 months covering the next 6 months periods and 12 months period for the one
prepared each December.

The Group entities prepare their own cash flow forecasts and they are centrally consolidated by Group
Finance. Group Finance monitors rolling forecasts of the group’s liquidity requirements, as well as the
Group’s actual cash and receivables position to ensure that it has sufficient cash to meet operational
needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its committed borrowings facilities to ensure that the
Group does not breach borrowings limits or covenants.

The Group entities keep the amounts required for working capital management and the excess cash is
transferred to the Group Finance who defines the best use of these funds (cancellation of loans,
deposits, etc.).

Access to sourcing of funding is sufficiently available through the revolving credit facility agreement
that the Group has with banks (Note 24). At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 this facility
was not used.

The flows expected for interest rate swaps will affect profit and loss in the same period as they are
expected to occur.

**28.4. Market risk**

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates
will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of
market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable
parameters, while optimising the return.

**Currency risk**

The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in exchange rates relates primarily to the Group’s
operating activities (when revenue or expense is denominated in a different currency from the Group’s
presentation currency). The exposures are mainly with respect to the US dollars (USD) and Pound
sterling (GBP). The loans and borrowings of the Group are denominated in Euros and US Dollars. The
objective is to match the main cash flows generated by the underlying operations of the Group with the
debt which provides an economic hedge.

Until October 2015 the Group’s investment in its Cayman subsidiary was partially hedged by two USD
denominated bank loans, one loan of USD 138 million of which USD 100 million was designated as
part of the hedge and another of USD 200 million which was fully designated as part of this hedge. Due
to the repayment of the loans in USD and the new loan in USD taken, the net investment hedge has
been redesigned: the new loan of USD 100 million is fully designated as part of this hedge. This
mitigates a portion of the foreign currency translation risk arising from the subsidiary’s net assets.

At December 31, 2015 the face value of the designated loan is EUR 91,853 thousand. The loan is
designated as a net investment hedge. No ineffectiveness was recognised from the net investment
hedge. The Group’s investments in other subsidiaries are not hedged.

**Interest rate risk**

The risk relates to the Group’s long term debt obligations with floating interest rates. To manage the
first risk the company enters into interest rate swaps.

F-210


-----

The financial liabilities related to loans and borrowings in USD with variable rate are 30% hedged
(Note 18.2), so cash flow volatility resulting from the interest rate fluctuation is limited to the
non-hedged part.

In January 2016, the Group entered into a forward interest rate swaps that cover 41% of the floating
interests on the EUR debt.

**Sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments**

An increase/decrease of 50 basis points in interest rates on loans and borrowings would have
decreased/ increased the profit and loss before tax by EUR 2,521 thousand
(2014: EUR 1,663 thousand). The sensitivity of interest to movements in interest rates is calculated on
floating rate exposures on debt, net of interest rate swaps. This analysis assumes that all other
variables remain constant.

**28.5. Capital management**

The capital structure of the Group consists of shares and share premium and bank borrowings. The
objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains healthy debt ratios in order
to support its business and face the obligations with banks.

The Group’s target is to reach a steady state leverage ratio of between 2.0 and 2.5 times. This
leverage ratio might be higher depending on the potential and the size of any acquisitions. The bank
borrowings are subject to covenants that are tested bi-annual: Leverage ratio (Note 24).

**28.6. Fair values of financial instruments**

The following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and financial
liabilities, including their levels in the fair value hierarchy. It does not include fair value information for
financial assets and financial liabilities not measured at fair value if the carrying amount is a reasonable

The fair value of the interest rate swaps is based on broker quotes and is calculated as the present
value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves. Fair values reflect the credit
risk of the instrument and include adjustments to take account of the credit risk of the Group entity and
counterparty when appropriate.

There are only level 2 fair values and no transfers between levels were applicable in 2015 and 2014.

**29.** **Operating leases**

**29.1. Leases as lessee**

The Group has entered into commercial leases on certain motor vehicles and items of office
equipment. These leases have an average life of between three and five years with no renewal option
included in the contracts.

The Group has entered into leases for rental agreements in different countries. The leases run for a
period between 1 and 10 years. Lease payments are increased with specific amounts and frequency
depending on the different agreements.

There are no restrictions placed upon the Group by entering into these leases.

Future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases as at 31 December are as
follows:


**Between one**
**and five years**

During the period an amount of EUR 14,965 thousand (2014: EUR 11,945 thousand) was recognised
as an expense in profit or loss in respect of operating leases. Total rental expenses reported in
statement of profit/loss includes utilities, maintenance and repairs expenses.

**29.2. Leases as lessor**

Some affiliates have entered into sublease contracts of office space. These sublease contracts have a
termination period of three months.

Future minimum rental receivables under non-cancellable operating leases as at 31 December are as

During the period an amount of EUR 3,377 thousand (2014: EUR 3,428 thousand) were included in
revenues.

**30.** **Commitments**

The Group is committed to incur IT capital expenditure (IT equipment and softwares) of
EUR 189 thousand (2014: EUR 393 thousand) and IT operational expenditure of EUR 20 thousand
(2014: EUR 124 thousand).

**31.** **Contingencies**

There are a few possible claims against the Group, the aggregate amount of which cannot be reliably
measured. Where necessary legal and/or external advice has been obtained and, in light of such
advice, the risk of litigation is provided adequately.

There is a remaining potential tax liability towards the Swiss tax authorities. This relates to a late
payment interest charge imposed by the Swiss tax authorities in the amount of CHF 9.1 million in
connection with the late payment of Swiss dividend withholding tax on a cash dividend paid in 2010 to
its former shareholders. The Group has filed a formal tax appeal against the imposition with the Swiss
tax authorities. If such liabilities materialise, we believe we can claim under contractual tax indemnity
clauses covered by a third party.

The Belgian tax authorities have delivered a notice to the third party liquidator of one of our former
subsidiaries for tax and penalties in the amount of approximately €16.4 million (excluding interest) in
connection with Belgian dividend withholding tax over the payment of liquidation proceeds of this
subsidiary in 2012. The exemption for dividend withholding tax has been challenged by the tax
authorities on technical grounds. A formal tax complaint has been filed in due course as there are good

grounds to challenge the tax assessment. In the framework of these ongoing administrative
proceedings it has been notified by the tax authorities that there are indeed no grounds for the initially
assessed penalties in the amount of approximately €5.4 million. It is furthermore believed that it is
more likely than not that a full release can be obtained.

**32.** **Related parties**

The transactions with related parties were conducted on an arm’s length basis.

In the current period, prior to the listing, the Group entered into transactions with parties related to
Blackstone Group for services received for advising, monitoring and transaction fees for the amount of
EUR 1,499 thousand (2014: EUR 1,603 thousand).

The Group has provided services to some entities related to Blackstone in the normal course of
business at arm’s length basis.

The outstanding financial assets of EUR 382 thousand at December 31, 2014, corresponding to an
unsecured loan to the Stichting Administratiekantoor Perpetual representing management that held
shares in its capacity as shareholder, have been repaid in 2015.

As part of the capital reorganisation of the Company, the amounts outstanding under the shareholder
loans payable to Blackstone Perpetual Topco S.à r.l. of EUR 95,535 thousand (2014: EUR 88,520
thousand) were contributed in exchange for newly issued ordinary shares of the Company. The interest
expenses in the current period, prior to the listing, amounted to EUR 7,016 thousand
(2014: EUR 16,909 thousand).

**32.1. Parent and ultimate controlling party**

Prior to the listing in the Euronext Amsterdam on October 15, 2015, the Company was ultimately
controlled by funds managed by Blackstone Group L.P. which had the majority shareholding in the
Group. The remaining shares were owned by parties related to management. Following the IPO, the
Company is the new ultimate controlling party.

**Independent auditor’s report**

To: the General Meeting and the Supervisory Board of Intertrust N.V.

**Report on the audit of the annual financial statements 2015**

**Opinion**

In our opinion:

    - the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of
Intertrust N.V. (the Company) as at 31 December 2015, and of its result and its cash flows for
2015 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the
European Union (EU-IFRS) and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code.

    - the company financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of Intertrust
N.V. as at 31 December 2015, and of its result for 2015 in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of
the Netherlands Civil Code.

**What we have audited**

We have audited the financial statements 2015 of Intertrust N.V., based in Amsterdam. The financial
statements include the consolidated financial statements and the company financial statements.

The consolidated financial statements comprise:

1 the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2015;

2 the following consolidated statements for 2015: the income statement, the statements of
comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows; and

3 the notes comprising a summary of the significant accounting policies and other explanatory
information.

The company financial statements comprise:

1 the company balance sheet as at 31 December 2015;

2 the company profit and loss account for 2015 and

3 the notes comprising a summary of the significant accounting policies and other explanatory
information.

**Basis for our opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing. Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the ‘Our responsibilities for the audit of
the financial statements’ section of our report.

We are independent of Intertrust N.V. in accordance with the Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid
van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten (ViO) and other relevant independence regulations in the
Netherlands. Furthermore, we have complied with the Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels
accountants (VGBA).

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our opinion.

**Audit approach**

**Summary**

**Unqualified audit opinion** **Materiality**

                                   - Overall materiality of EUR 3 million

                                   - 3.5% of 2015 adjusted profit before tax

**Key audit matters** **Audit scope**

 - Accounting for the IPO - Coverage of 88% of revenue

 - Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets

 - Revenue recognition and risk of management
override (fraud)

 - Completeness of provisioning for litigation and
claims

**Materiality**

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate,
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of
these financial statements. The materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures
and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion.

Based on our professional judgment we determined the materiality for the financial statements as a
whole at EUR 3 million. The materiality is determined with reference to the 2015 profit before tax,
adjusted for 2015 Initial Public Offering and debt restructuring expenses which are not deemed
representative of the normal operations, and normalising interest costs at the level of the new external
debt. Our materiality is 3.5% of the derived adjusted profit before tax.

We consider adjusted profit before tax to be the most appropriate benchmark as it better reflects the
operations of the Company. We have also taken into account misstatements and/or possible
misstatements that in our opinion are material for qualitative reasons for the users of the financial
statements.

We agreed with the Supervisory Board that misstatements in excess of EUR 150,000 identified during
the audit, would be reported to them, as well as smaller misstatements that in our view must be
reported on qualitative grounds.

**Scope of the group audit**

Intertrust N.V. is the head of a group of entities. The financial information of this group is included in
the financial statements of Intertrust N.V.

Because we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for directing,
supervising and performing the group audit. In this respect we have determined the nature and extent
of the audit procedures to be carried out for group entities. Decisive in making this determination were
the size and / or the risk profile of the group entities or operations. On this basis, we selected group
entities for which an audit or review had to be carried out on the complete set of financial information or
specific items.

Our group audit mainly focused on group entities that were significant based on revenues, leading to
operating entities in the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Guernsey and Cayman Islands being in-scope. To
increase coverage the audit for consolidation purposes was extended to include Switzerland, Curaçao
and Hong Kong as well. The audit scope coverage for 2015 is 88% of the consolidated revenues. All
components in-scope for group reporting are audited by KPMG member firms.

F-225


-----

We have also:

    - performed audit procedures over significant accounts such as external debt and taxes
ourselves at group holding entities in the Netherlands and Luxembourg;

    - centrally audited the impairment test over intangible assets including goodwill;

    - performed analytical review procedures or specific audit procedures at other group entities.

By performing the procedures mentioned above at group entities, together with additional procedures
at group level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence about the group’s
financial information to provide an opinion about the financial statements.

**Our key audit matters**

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our
audit of the financial statements. We have communicated the key audit matters to the Supervisory
Board. The key audit matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters discussed.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in
forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

**Accounting for the Initial Public Offering**

**Description**

The Initial Public Offering (IPO) which took effect as of 15 October 2015 resulted in a number of
subjective areas of accounting, mainly around additional reporting requirements and disclosures.

Management performed extensive analysis of the appropriate accounting for the IPO, including topics
such as the contribution of Intertrust Topholding (Luxembourg) S.à.r.l. to Intertrust N.V. via a capital
reorganisation, the presentation of comparatives, the accounting for proceeds and costs related to the
IPO based on legal documentation, including the income tax impact and accounting for the refinancing
of the external debt.

Management has disclosed the accounting for the capital reorganisation in note 1 of the consolidated
financial statements, the accounting for the proceeds and costs of the IPO in note 23 and the
refinancing of the external debt at the date of the IPO in note 24. Due to subjectivity involved, these
areas of accounting require specific audit attention and related procedures.

**Our response**

We assessed and audited management’s selection of accounting principles and subsequent
accounting for the IPO—

    - We involved KPMG financial reporting specialists in relation to the accounting for the capital
reorganisation which impacts on both the consolidated and company financial statements;

    - We understood and documented management’s process in relation to the capital
reorganisation, IPO proceeds/ costs and debt restructuring, ensuring that the accounting
treatment adopted is in line with the applicable financial reporting standards (both EU-IFRS
and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code). We read the relevant legal documents
and reconciled the receipt or payment of cash to bank statements, where applicable;

    - We involved a tax specialist on the tax treatment adopted by management on the IPO related
costs and costs related to the debt refinancing.

**Our observation**

We found the accounting treatment applied by management for the contribution of Intertrust
Topholding (Luxembourg) S.à.r.l. to Intertrust N.V. via a capital reorganisation, the presentation of

F-226


-----

comparatives, the accounting for proceeds and costs related to the IPO based on legal documentation,
including the income tax impact and accounting for the refinancing of the external debt acceptable
under the applicable financial reporting standards.

**Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets**

**Description**

The company has recognised a significant amount of goodwill and intangibles for client relationships
and brand names, predominantly emanating from the acquisitions of the ATC and Intertrust businesses
by the previous majority shareholder. There exists a potential risk of impairment of intangible assets,
including goodwill, to the extent actual developments negatively deviate from the assumptions applied
during the acquisition of the group entities. The assumptions used by management are to a large
extent subjective by nature.

Management has prepared an annual impairment test, based on the determined Cash Generating Unit
(CGU) level, in accordance with IAS 36: Impairment of assets, for intangible assets (including goodwill,
customer relationship assets and brand names) using a value in use methodology consistent with the
methodology applied in prior years.

The impairment test is based on the budget for 2016/2017, forecasted cash flows beyond 2017 and a
discount rate (weighted average cost of capital or WACC) which has been updated for market
developments in 2015.

The amounts recognised, the assumptions and sensitivities used to assess the recoverable amount
recognised are disclosed in note 16 of the consolidated financial statements.

**Our response**

Among other procedures, we assessed and audited management’s impairment test—

    - We challenged management’s budget and cash flow forecasts, performing sensitivity
analyses and a retrospective review of the historical accuracy of management’s estimations;

    - Involved KPMG valuation specialists to assist the audit team in the audit procedures
performed. The valuation specialist’s procedures included evaluating the methodology used
by management, assessing the reasonableness of the WACC and performing independent
sensitivity analyses over the key assumptions used by management in the impairment test;

    - Assessed if management’s determination of the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) and the related
carrying value was appropriate.

**Our observation**

We believe that the valuation of the goodwill and intangible assets for client relationships and brand
name is balanced in the context of the financial statements as a whole. We found the disclosure of the
assumptions and sensitivities acceptable under the applicable financial reporting standards.

**Revenue recognition and risk of management override (fraud)**

**Description**

Fraudulent revenue recognition, in particular existence of revenue, was considered a significant
inherent risk for the financial statements of Intertrust N.V. 2015 from an audit perspective. It relates to
the potential manipulation of cut-off of revenues, management override of controls and potential bias in
estimates of the recoverability of work in progress (WIP) and debtors.

Management override relevant to internal controls is an action or a series of actions performed by
management to bypass established internal controls. Management override may be driven by a desire
to reach targets set in the IPO for the financial year 2015 or the subsequent year.

F-227


-----

**Our response**

We addressed the risk of revenue recognition and management override in our audit through a
combination of controls testing and substantive testing—

    - We involved KPMG forensic specialists in our fraud risk assessment and in designing audit
procedures to address the risk of fraud;

    - We understood and tested the key controls in relation to revenue recognition, such as the
approval of written hours, reconciliation of written hours to contractual hours and review of
proposed invoicing;

    - We tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of the general IT controls
applicable to the system for financial reporting to the extent that this is considered effective
and efficient in our audit approach. Logical access controls were not completely implemented
in the Netherlands and Luxembourg which resulted in the performance of additional
substantive audit procedures;

    - We performed substantive audit procedures in relation to cut-off of revenue. Amongst other
procedures we verified: the timing of revenue recognition with underlying contracts and written
hours; whether credit notes issued after balance sheet date related to revenue recognised in
2015; the existence and collectability of WIP and debtor balances by reconciling WIP to
written hours and testing the aging of accounts receivable;

    - We performed manual journal entry testing of both journal entries recorded directly in the
consolidation, and journal entries recorded by local management, utilising data analysis tools
where possible;

    - We assessed the reasonableness of management’s estimates in relation to the recoverability
of WIP and debtors, performed a retrospective review of the historical accuracy of
management’s estimations, and assessed the accounting policies applied for indications of
management bias.

**Our observation**

Our audit procedures did not reveal indications of management bias or override of controls in the
estimates and accounting applied by management in relation to the recognition of revenue,
recoverability of WIP and debtors.

**Completeness of provisioning for litigations and claims**

**Description**

Considering the line of business of Intertrust N.V., in combination with the inherent subjectivity in
identifying, monitoring and provisioning of claims, there is a potential risk of misstatement in claim
provisions and contingency disclosures. Management’s assessment of legal claims is included in note
27 of the consolidated financial statements, and the description of contingencies is included in note 31.

**Our response**

We have addressed the risk of completeness of litigation and claims, and breaches in laws and
regulations, and evaluation of the estimates in Management’s process, in our audit through a
combination of controls testing and substantive testing, amongst other procedures—

    - Our control testing included testing management’s controls in relation to risks of breaches in
laws and regulations, as well as testing controls over litigation and claims monitoring and
provision recognition;

    - We challenged Management’s assessment of litigations and claims, and subsequent
assessment of provisions required as at the year-end with a combination of procedures
including inquiry with in-house legal counsels (at the group level and at group entities) and
substantive evidence including confirmation letters, contracts, case summaries from external
legal counsels and tax specialists;

F-228


-----

    - We assessed the completeness and reasonableness of contingency disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements in light of the evidence obtained from our audit procedures
as described in bullet two.

**Our observation**

We found the provision for litigation and claims to be recognised in accordance with the accounting
principles as disclosed in note 3.15 of the consolidated financial statements.

**Responsibilities of the Management Board and the Supervisory Board of Intertrust N.V. for the**
**financial statements**

The Management Board of Intertrust N.V. is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the
financial statements in accordance with EU-IFRS and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil
Code and for the preparation of the Management Board report in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of
the Netherlands Civil Code. Furthermore, the Management Board of the Company is responsible for
such internal control as the Management Board determines is necessary to enable the preparation of
the financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to errors or fraud.

As part of the preparation of the financial statements, the Management Board of Intertrust N.V. is
responsible for assessing the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial
reporting framework mentioned, the Management Board of the Company should prepare the financial
statements using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Management Board of the
Company either intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative
but to do so. The Management Board of the Company should disclose events and circumstances that
may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern in the financial
statements.

The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the company’s financial reporting process.

**Our responsibilities for the audit of financial statements**

Our objective is to plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence for our
opinion. Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means
we may not have detected all errors and fraud. For a further description of our responsibilities in
respect of an audit of financial statements we refer to the website of the professional body for
accountants in the Netherlands (NBA) www.nba.nl/standardtexts-auditorsreport.
