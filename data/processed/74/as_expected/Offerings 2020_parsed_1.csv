As the DGEL Group was acquired on 31 December 2018, the assets and liabilities of",1266.3.1,,"the DGEL Group have been included in the consolidated balance sheet of Drax Group plc as of 31 December 2018, but no income, expenditure or cash flows relating to the DGEL Group has been included in the Group’s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018. The 2020 Drax Group Unaudited Financial Statements and the 2019 Drax Group Audited Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”). The 2019 Drax Group Audited Financial Statements have been audited by Deloitte LLP. Drax Group plc is the indirect parent of the Issuer, and the Issuer intends to provide a copy of the consolidated financial statements of Drax Group plc to holders of the Notes following the Issue Date.

Statutory accounts for Drax Group plc for the financial years ended 31 December 2019 and,1266.4.1,,"2018 have been reported on by the company’s auditor and delivered to the registrar of companies. The reports of the auditor were (i) unqualified, (ii) did not include a reference to any matters to which the auditor drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying their reports, and (iii) did not contain a statement under section 498(2) or (3) of the Companies Act. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying our accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in the Group’s audited consolidated financial statements. ###### xi ----- See “Independent Auditors” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and Our Capital _Structure—Investors in and purchasers of the Notes may have limited or no recourse against our independent auditors in respect of the Drax Group Audited Financial Statements” for a description of the independent_ auditors’ reports of Deloitte LLP.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654
74_1,Offerings 2020.md,1266,PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND OTHER INFORMATION,1266.5,Comparability of Drax Group Audited Financial Statements,1266.5.1,,"The Group’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended 31 December 2019 are not directly comparable with the Group’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended 31 December 2018 due to the Group’s adoption of IFRS 16 from 1 January 2019, using the modified retrospective method of adoption. The new requirements have impacted the Group’s accounting for lease contracts. The Group’s lease portfolio predominantly relates to properties and the hire of plant and equipment at operating sites. On transition to IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019, assets controlled under lease contracts were brought onto the balance sheet as right-of-use assets, and the Group has recognised a corresponding liability for the amounts payable under its lease contracts. Comparative information for the year ended 31 December 2018 has not been restated. Under the previous accounting standards, operating leases were expensed to the income statement on a systematic basis over the lease term (in the year ended 31 December 2018, £6.3 million was expensed to operating expenses for the operating lease rentals). Under IFRS 16, operating leases are recognised on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets with a corresponding lease liability, resulting in a reduction in operating expenses by £7.4 million in 2019 and an equivalent amount of improved EBITDA in the same year. As at 1 January 2019, right-of-use assets of £37.1 million were recognised and presented separately in the balance sheet (which includes £0.6 million of lease assets recognised previously under finance leases that were reclassified from property, plant and equipment) and additional lease liabilities of £37.6 million were recognised separately on the balance sheet (including £0.5 million previously recognised as finance leases that were reclassified from borrowings). Prepayments of £0.1 million and trade and other payables of £0.7 million related to previous operating leases were derecognised.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654
74_1,Offerings 2020.md,1266,PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND OTHER INFORMATION,1266.6,Non-IFRS Financial Measures,1266.6.1,,"This Offering Memorandum contains certain non-IFRS measures and ratios, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Cost of Sales, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Operating Profit, Adjusted Interest payable and similar charges, Adjusted Total Tax Credit/Charge, net debt, net leverage, operating cash conversion and certain other measures (the “Non-IFRS Measures”) that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS or the accounting standards of any other jurisdiction. We define the following Non-IFRS Measures as follows: - “Adjusted EBITDA” as profit/loss for the year before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, excluding the impact of exceptional items and certain remeasurements. For the six months ended 30 June 2020 and 2019 and the years ended 31 December 2019 and 2018, Adjusted EBITDA is profit/loss for the year before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, foreign exchange gain/loss, other gains, losses on disposals, and excluding the impact of exceptional items (comprising acquisition and restructuring costs and asset obsolescence charges) and certain remeasurements on derivative contracts which cannot be designated as hedging instruments under IFRS, as presented in our income statement for the six months ended 30 June 2020 and 2019 and the years ended 31 December 2019 and 2018. - “Adjusted Revenue” as revenue excluding the impact of certain remeasurements on derivative contracts which cannot be designated as hedging instruments under IFRS. - “Adjusted EBITDA Margin” as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Adjusted Revenue; - “Adjusted Cost of Sales” as cost of sales excluding the impact of certain remeasurements on derivative contracts which cannot be designated as hedging instruments under IFRS; - “Adjusted Gross Profit” as gross profit excluding the impact of certain remeasurements on derivative contracts which cannot be designated as hedging instruments under IFRS; - “Adjusted Operating Profit” as operating profit excluding the impact of exceptional items and certain remeasurements on derivative contracts which cannot be designated as hedging instruments under IFRS; - “Adjusted Interest payable and similar charges” as interest payable and similar charges excluding the impact of debt restructuring costs associated with the refinancing of the Group’s debt; xii ----- - “Adjusted Total Tax Credit/Charge” as total tax credit/charge excluding the tax impact of exceptional items and certain remeasurements on derivative contracts which cannot designated as hedging instruments under IFRS; - “net debt” as current and non-current borrowings and overdrafts (net of deferred finance costs) less cash and cash equivalents; and - “net leverage” as the ratio of consolidated net debt to Adjusted EBITDA. We believe that the presentation of the Non-IFRS Measures enhances an investor’s understanding of our operating performance and our ability to service our debt. In addition, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a measure commonly used by investors. Our Non-IFRS Measures may not be comparable with similarly titled measures used by other companies. Our Adjusted EBITDA and related leverage and coverage ratios are not measurements of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS. Our Non-IFRS Measures have important limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results of operations as reported under IFRS. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently from the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA” under the Indenture. Some other limitations of Adjusted EBITDA-based measures include: - they do not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; - they do not reflect any cash income taxes and certain other taxes that we may be required to pay; - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows; and - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations. Because of these limitations, our Non-IFRS Measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our IFRS results and using these Non-IFRS Measures only in a supplemental manner to evaluate our performance. Key performance indicators (with the exception of Adjusted Revenue, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted EBITDA and net debt) and the other non-financial operational data included in this Offering Memorandum are not part of our financial statements and have not been audited. Our use or computation of these indicators may not be comparable with the use or computation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies. None of the key performance indicators or other non-financial operating data included in this Offering Memorandum should be considered in isolation or as an alternative to any indicator of our operating performance, cash flows or other measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS. For a reconciliation of each of the Non-IFRS Measures (other than those mentioned in the next sentence) to the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS and further discussion of the limitations of these Non-IFRS Measures, refer to “Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other _Data—Summary historical financial and other information—Other Financial and As Adjusted Information” and_ “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Performance _Indicators”. A reconciliation of each of Adjusted Cost of Sales, Adjusted Operating Profit, Adjusted Interest_ payable and similar items and Adjusted total tax credit/charge to the most directly comparable IFRS measure is included within the consolidated income statements in the 2020 Drax Group Unaudited Financial Statements and in the 2019 Drax Group Audited Financial Statements.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

74_1,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.1,,"We are an innovative electricity generation and supply business in the UK with the goal of enabling a zero-carbon, lower cost energy future. Over the last decade, we have undertaken the largest single site decarbonisation project in Europe as we converted four of the six generation units at Drax Power Station, historically the largest coal-fired power plant in Europe, to run on sustainable biomass, becoming the largest singlesite generator of renewable electricity in the UK. We also expanded our business across the value chain through organic growth and complementary acquisitions and now have an integrated utility business model focused on renewable-led, low-carbon and flexible power generation, the production of sustainable biomass wood pellets and the supply of renewable electricity, gas and other related services to business customers. Our business activities are grouped within three distinct segments: Generation, Pellet Production and Customers. Through our Generation segment, we own and operate a multi-site, multi-technology portfolio of power plants across the UK with a total generation capacity of approximately 6.5GW. We are the UK’s largest renewable generator and the fourth largest electricity generator in the UK based upon anticipated output (as published by the System Operator). We play a significant role in providing reliable, renewable and flexible electricity generation capacity along with increasingly important System Support Services, enhancing the security of the UK’s electricity supply and supporting the UK’s transition to a low-carbon future. Our generation assets include sustainable biomass, pumped storage, hydro and thermal power plants. In 2019, we produced 17.3TWh of electricity, out of which 79.2% came from renewable sources, 16.8% from natural gas and 3.5% from coal. Our generation assets are located across the UK, and we have options to develop further generation capacity in the UK. The multi-site, multi-technology nature of our generation assets and diversified fuel sources allow us to generate flexible and low-carbon electricity and enable us to provide System Support Services to the UK energy system. The System Operator has a growing need for System Support Services and we have a number of contracts in place with the System Operator to supply such services. We own and operate Drax Power Station, which is the largest power plant in the UK by generation capacity with an installed capacity of approximately 4.0GW. Drax Power Station is a critical part of the UK’s energy infrastructure, generating approximately 5 per cent of the UK’s total electricity, and 12 per cent. of the UK’s renewable electricity between January 2018 and December 2019. Based on the 2018-2019 compliance period, Drax Power Station is also the UK’s largest single-site generator of renewable electricity in the UK. Drax Power Station provides flexible and reliable generation and produced 14.0TWh of electricity in 2019, of which 96 per cent. was generated from sustainable biomass, making us a core part of the UK’s decarbonisation strategy. Between 2013 and 2016, we converted three coal-fired generation units at Drax Power Station to biomass-fired generation and in August 2018, we completed the conversion of a fourth coal-fired generation unit at Drax Power Station to biomass-fired generation (at a lower cost than that of converting each of the previous three biomass- fired generation units). Our four biomass-fired generation units receive regulatory support through the index- linked CfD and RO regimes, leading to enhanced earnings streams with a significant component of stable and predictable revenue extending to 2027. Our biomass-fired generation assets are served by an efficient and reliable biomass supply chain comprising dedicated port handling infrastructure and rail paths, thereby enhancing security of supply of fuel for our electricity generation activities. Following a comprehensive review of operations and discussions with National Grid, Ofgem and the Government, we have determined to end commercial coal generation at Drax Power Station in March 2021, with formal closure of coal units to occur in September 2022 at the end of existing Capacity Market obligation ahead of the UK’s 2025 deadline. 1 ----- Our hydropower generation assets include Cruachan pumped storage power plant and hydro power plants at Galloway and Lanark. Cruachan provides over 28 per cent. of the UK’s useable pumped storage capacity and is capable of generating 440MW of large-scale storage and flexible electricity continuously for 16 hours. It also provides contracted System Support Services to the UK electricity system and participates in the Balancing Mechanism, in addition to merchant power generation. In January 2020, Cruachan participated in the stability tender and won a six-year contract which commenced in July 2020 to provide System Support Services to the System Operator, and we are well-positioned to participate in forthcoming auctions for different support service requirements across the UK. The Galloway and Lanark hydro power plants are capable of generating up to a combined 126MW of stable renewable electricity. Lanark (17MW) receives regulatory support from the RO Scheme in respect of its full generation capacity, and Galloway (109MW) receives regulatory support from the RO Scheme with respect to approximately 28MW of its generating capacity, in addition to operating a reservoir and dam system providing power storage capabilities and opportunities for peaking and System Support Services. Our gas-fired generation assets include four CCGT power stations in southern and northern England. Our CCGT power stations at Damhead Creek (805MW), Rye House (715MW), Shoreham (420MW) and Blackburn Mill (60MW) provide baseload and peak power generation, in addition to other System Support Services. We are further responding to the growth in intermittent renewable capacity on the electricity grid by developing a pipeline of flexible generation options, including options to develop up to four 299MW rapid- response standalone OCGT projects and options to repurpose and repower one or both of our remaining coal- fired generation units at Drax Power Station to gas-fired generation. In addition, our Damhead Creek site benefits from an option for the development of a further CCGT asset, Damhead Creek II, which would provide us with an additional 1.8GW of gas generation capacity. We are also exploring an option to expand Cruachan pumped storage plant by up to 0.4GW. Each of these projects has the potential to provide flexible and reliable electricity to the UK electricity system and further diversify our future energy generation capability. However, each project is subject to our long-standing capital allocation policy which seeks to maintain robust financial metrics and a stable net leverage profile and would require an appropriate Capacity Market agreement in future Capacity Market auctions. Through our Pellet Production segment, we produce compressed wood pellets from sustainable sources such as managed forests and sawmill residue in three plants in the US Gulf region. These pellets are used as fuel for our biomass-fired generation in the UK and provided 22 per cent. of our total biomass requirement for the year ended 31 December 2019. The manufacturing process entails purchasing low-grade wood and residues from suppliers local to the manufacturing facilities and transforming them into pellets that can be transported costeffectively to Drax Power Station to generate low-carbon energy. All three of our wood pellet manufacturing facilities are certified under the industry standard Sustainable Biomass Program as producing legally and sustainably sourced biomass. Our wood pellet manufacturing facilities currently have a capacity of 1,475,000 tonnes which we aim to increase to 1,825,000 tonnes by 2021. We are targeting to self-supply five million tonnes of biomass per annum by 2027 as part of our broader initiative to reduce operating costs and expect this increased capacity to deliver returns significantly in excess of the Group’s cost of capital, with strong cash flow generation and fast payback. In furtherance of these objectives, we are investing in three new satellite plants in the US Gulf, which will utilise sawmill residues and leverage our existing US Gulf infrastructure to produce, we believe, biomass at around 20% below the current cost of production. In addition to sustainable biomass pellet plants, we own and operate dedicated port handling infrastructure and rail paths which allows us to achieve economies of scale and reduce the cost and carbon footprint of our operations by allowing us to aggregate small shipments from smaller 2 ----- suppliers into larger shipments, thereby reducing the overall carbon footprint of the relevant shipments. In addition to self-supply from our manufacturing facilities, we have a network of third party suppliers of sustainable biomass pellets and have a number of long-term contracts with suppliers in North America and Europe to support a long-term, stable supply of biomass. 100 per cent. of the biomass used at Drax Power Station is from sustainable sources (such as sawmill residues, forest thinnings, low value roundwood and branches, but no saw logs are permitted to be used) and the use of SBP certification provides independent assurance that woody biomass is supplied from legal and sustainable sources and that all regulatory requirements in relation to biomass for energy production are met. Our Customers segment, comprising leading challenger brands Haven Power and Opus, is the fifth largest supplier of electricity to businesses in the UK by volume supplied as of 30 April 2020 and the largest provider of renewable energy to businesses. As of 1 October 2020, we supplied over 281,500 electricity and gas meters and, in 2019, we supplied 18.9TWh of electricity and gas. Our Customers segment had an 8 per cent. share of the B2B electricity market by volume of supply in Great Britain as at 30 June 2020 and provides us with a direct route to market for much of the electricity and RoCs we generate and a more diversified counterparty base with less concentrated counterparty credit risk than direct sales by our Generation segment in the wholesale market. We are committed to operating a sustainable business. We are continuing to make progress pioneering world-leading bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (“BECCS”), to deliver negative emissions and help the UK meet its 2050 net zero carbon target. BECCS can play an important role by removing CO2 from the atmosphere and safely storing it, creating negative emissions. The UK’s Committee on Climate Change (“CCC”) has clearly set out what is required for the country to achieve its legally binding objective of being net zero by 2050, including an important role for BECCS. In its response to the CCC report, the UK Government confirmed that there is widespread acceptance that carbon capture and storage has a key role to play in achieving net zero, and announced it is developing a new cross-government Biomass Strategy to assess how biomass should be used across the economy to contribute to the Government’s net zero target. We have identified, track and report on nine non-financial priorities that are material to our business and important to our stakeholders: carbon emissions; environmental impact; sourcing sustainable biomass; healthy forest landscapes; people and culture; health, safety and wellbeing; ethics and integrity and positive social impact. Our strategy is aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals and we have identified SDG numbers 7 (affordable and clean energy), 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), 11 (sustainable cities and communities), 13 (climate action), 15 (life on land) and 17 (partnerships for the goals) where we can have the greatest positive impact. To ensure the biomass we use meets the highest standards, we have set up an Independent Advisory Board (“IAB”) which provides independent advice in all areas of biomass sourcing and performance, and its role in achieving Drax’s ambition of being a carbon negative company. Our efforts have been recognised externally as we are a member of the FTSE4Good Index. In addition, Sustainalytics and MSCI, leading independent providers of environmental, social and corporate governance (“ESG”) research and ratings, have awarded Drax Group PLC an ESG Risk Rating of 25.9 (Medium Risk) and a relative performance ranking of 2nd out of 61 for Independent Power Production and Traders by Subindustry Group and AA respectively.

Drax Group plc is listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange under stock ticker “DRX”, and is part of the FTSE 250 Index. Drax Group plc’s market capitalisation as at 30 June 2020 was approximately £1,021 million. Our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended 30 June 2020 was £451 million and our adjusted net debt, being borrowings less cash and cash equivalents as at 30 June 2020 was £792 million.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654
74_1,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Strengths,9.2.1,We are critical to supporting the UK’s energy needs.,"We are a nationally critical low-carbon energy group and a fundamental part of the UK’s energy infrastructure. Our diversified generation portfolio of eight power stations includes capacity to generate 2.6GW from renewable biomass, 0.6GW from pumped storage and hydro and 2GW from gas-fired generation assets. These assets produce flexible, low-carbon and renewable electricity, and provide System Support Services to the UK electricity system. The System Support Services are increasingly important to the UK energy system in that it provides the flexibility required as it decarbonizes and becomes increasingly dominated by intermittent renewables technologies— principally wind. Between January 2018 and December 2019 our current portfolio of technically and geographically diverse generation assets consistently produced 12 per cent. of the UK’s renewable electricity, making us the fourth largest electricity generator in the UK based upon anticipated output (as published by the System Operator). Our generation facility at Drax Power Station, is the largest power station in the UK by generation capacity, with approximately 4.0GW of installed capacity primarily from four biomass-fired units and two legacy coalfired units. Since 2013, we have substantially decarbonised our generation from Drax Power Station, undertaking Europe’s largest decarbonisation project, by converting four of six legacy coal generation units to biomass. We also plan to retire the two remaining coal generation units from commercial generation in March 2021. Through our biomass-fired generation units, Drax Power Station is also the largest single-site renewable energy generation asset in the UK. Each of the generation units at Drax Power Station can be operated independently and has the flexibility to generate electricity at varying levels of output, enabling these generation units to provide a range of generation and System Support Services to the UK electricity system. Our pumped storage, hydro and CCGT assets are located across the UK, and also provide the flexible generation and non-generation System Support Services increasingly required by the UK energy system to enable higher levels of intermittent renewable generation. These assets therefore also earn revenues from power generation and non-commodity exposed contract revenues. One example of this is our Cruachan Power Station, a pumped storage asset operated by Drax, which won a synchronous compensator tender for a six year contract commencing in July 2020 to provide long-term System Support Services in this respect. This service can only be provided by technologies capable of providing ancillary services, including inertia and reactive power, without generating potentially unneeded electricity. Our purpose is to enable a zero carbon energy future and we have an ambition to be a carbon negative company by 2030, through the development of negative emissions. We aim to realise these ambitions through the delivery of our strategy, which has three strands: 1) create a long-term future for sustainable biomass; 2) be the leading provider of system support in the UK; and 3) give customers control of their energy. The UK electricity market has been experiencing a period of significant structural change. In the last decade, there has been a substantial increase in intermittent, renewable generation, which has rapidly displaced flexible, thermal generation. This historically provided the UK electricity system with a combination of reliable 4 ----- and flexible generation and the non-generation System Support Services that a well-functioning and stable electricity system requires. The Group’s portfolio of flexible, renewable and low-carbon generation assets is well placed to help the system operator manage the challenges of decarbonisation and system stability. As a strategic part of the UK’s critical national infrastructure, we recognise our responsibility to support the country’s response to Covid-19. We have remained in close contact with the UK Government and are committed to supplying the flexible, low-carbon and renewable electricity the UK needs, especially to the 181,500 businesses, including care homes, schools and hospitals we supply through our Customers segment. All of our operations have continued during the crisis, we have not sought any Covid-19 financial support from any government and no employees have been furloughed.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654
74_1,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Strengths,9.2.2,We are critical to enabling the UK’s delivery of a lower carbon economy.,"Our sustainability strategy is underpinned by a range of environmental, social and governance (ESG) commitments and external certifications that apply to its biomass sourcing activities as well as overall ESG performance. The importance of sustainability to the business is underlined by the inclusion of sustainability performance as a key part of the Group Scorecard. As far as biomass sourcing is concerned, we rely on a number of internationally recognised forest certification programmes—for example the Sustainable Forest Initiative (SFI), Forest Stewardship Council[® ](FSC[®]) and the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC). These programmes ensure Drax’s suppliers manage their forests responsibly in accordance with high ESG standards. We also co-founded the Sustainable Biomass Program (SBP), a certification system designed for woody biomass, mostly in the form of wood pellets and woodchips, used in industrial, large-scale energy production. SBP certification provides assurance that woody biomass is supplied from legal and sustainable sources and that all regulatory requirements in relation to biomass for energy production are met. In terms of overall ESG performance, we maintain a AA rating with MSCI and have been awarded an ESG Risk Rating of 25.9 (Medium Risk) by Sustainalytics—two recognised leading independent providers of ESG research and ratings. Sustainalytics also awarded us a relative ESG performance ranking of 2nd of 61 for Independent Power Production and Traders by Subindustry Group. We are the UK’s largest single source of renewable electricity and flexible low-carbon and renewable electricity. With our multi-site, multi-technology asset portfolio, we are ideally placed to provide significant flexibility to support increasing numbers of intermittent renewables coming on to the grid. In addition to the ability to provide baseload renewable generation from our biomass generating units, our portfolio has the flexibility to provide System Support Services including the ability to provide power within seconds to balance demand and to generate electricity to balance other critical grid requirements, such as balancing voltage or inertia.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

Our technically and geographically diverse portfolio of generation assets is well placed to provide such services. Between 2012 and 2019, 24GW of flexible, thermal generation capacity in the UK was decommissioned and replaced by more than 13GW of intermittent renewable generation. 5 ----- **UK GENERATION EVOLUTION(TWH)[(1][)]** ###### 2006-2019 CAGR: Overall: (1.1%) Renewables: +15.3% Fossil Fuel & Other: (4.4%) ###### 400 300 ###### 200 100",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

The UK has a stated target to increase the proportion of its electricity generation from offshore wind to 30 per cent. by 2030 and a wider commitment to reducing GHG emissions to net zero by 2050. The UK Government has committed £557 million for the future Contract for Difference auctions for offshore wind, incentivizing a pipeline of new investments. However, intermittent renewable generation is dependent on favourable weather conditions and is therefore less able to respond to fluctuations in electricity demand. Recent extreme weather events (for example, changes in the behaviour of the polar vortex) and corresponding peaks in demand have demonstrated the limitations of intermittent generation. In Winter 2016/2017 and Winter 2017/2018, the UK and Europe experienced extended periods of very low temperatures coupled with little to no wind, putting strain on UK and European system infrastructure, leading to elevated electricity prices as well as observable large spikes in electricity prices during certain periods. Additionally, in the first half of 2020 Covid-19 caused a reduction in demand for electricity, which in turn caused the system operator to take more action to balance the system, procuring System Support Services from flexible generators like Drax. Following one of the UK’s largest blackouts in more than a decade on 9 August 2019, an Ofgem report into the incident recommended a number of actions to make the UK’s energy system more resilient to sudden losses of power, including a review of the costs and benefits of additional flexibility and reserve capacity to mitigate against similar future events. In January 2020, the Government announced that it will implement all ten clear actions recommended in the report, and has formed the Energy Emergency Executive Committee group to work towards a more resilient power system. To achieve the UK’s net zero 2050 commitment and support the increase in intermittent wind and solar generation, there will be a need for complementary flexible generation assets that can provide System Support Services and alter their generation profiles at any point in time to support the changing levels of intermittent generation. Our flexible, renewable and low-carbon generation portfolio allows us to meet the increasing need for System Support Services arising from the increase in intermittent generation in the system more broadly and particularly at times of system strain, and play an important role in the UK’s security of energy supply. The reduction in thermal generation capacity in the UK outlined above means that there are fewer operators and plants available in the long term to provide such services, and even fewer who can do so in the low carbon way that we are able to offer through our biomass, hydro and pumped storage assets. We have a significant pipeline of generation options which will, if developed, enable us to provide flexible baseload generation and additional System Support Services, further strengthening our position as a provider of such services.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

74_1,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Strengths,9.2.6,Our earnings benefit from a high degree of stability and visibility.,"As we continue to move away from non-renewable fuels, and with growth in non-generation System Support Services and our biomass supply and Customers segment, we expect our Adjusted EBITDA to be derived predominantly from non-commodity exposed sources of earnings in the future. Our earnings have a high degree of stability and visibility as a result of: - earnings from our biomass-fired generation units under the CfD Regime and RO Scheme (see below), the latter of which allows us to flexibly optimise our generation across our RO-accredited units, substantially reducing our operational risk; - Capacity Market payments and System Support Services contracts for a range of our generation assets; - a naturally hedged portfolio of generation assets and businesses through the value chain; - a long-term hedging policy; and - increased control over fuel input costs via an integrated biomass supply chain. As a consequence of this trend, the volatility of our earnings, which had historically characterised our cash flows prior to our decarbonisation efforts, is substantially reduced. We now have long-term visibility of our cash flows, underpinned by a more diverse generation portfolio and operational flexibility. _Long-term contracted Government revenues_ Generation from Drax Power Station’s existing biomass generation units benefits from a UK legislative and contractual framework designed to support renewable energy sources. One of our biomass-fired generation units receives support through the CfD Regime, while our other three biomass-fired generation units are supported under the RO Scheme (which, in the current RO compliance year, pay a premium of approximately £54 per MWH above the market price). One of our biomass-fired generation units receives support through the CfD Regime, while our other three biomass-fired generation units are supported under the RO Scheme. The support we receive under both regimes extends to 2027. As a renewable fuel, biomass is exempt from the EU ETS and Carbon Price Support. Our CfD is a private law contract between Drax Power and a Government-owned entity, the Low Carbon Contracts Company Limited. Under our CfD, we are paid any shortfall, and repay any excess, between a strike price and a market reference price calculated as the average market price for electricity in the UK market over a given period. Our CfD is indexed to the UK consumer price index and extends to March 2027. It provides an effective hedge against the electricity price at current market prices and thereby supports earnings stability and visibility for our business. We also received an Investment Contract in respect of our third biomass unit, providing a visible earnings stream out to 2027. See “Industry Overview—Overview of Electricity Market Reform—Investment _Contracts”._ The RO Scheme, established in 2002 to encourage the development of large-scale renewable electricity capacity in the UK, places an obligation on licensed electricity suppliers either to source a proportion of the electricity they provide to customers from eligible renewable sources or to make a payment equal to the buy-out price. The buy-out price increases in line with UK retail price index each year. The sourcing of renewable energy is demonstrated by the supplier presenting ROCs (equivalent in number to the supplier’s individual obligation) to the administrator of the RO Scheme, Ofgem. ROCs are issued by Ofgem to renewable generators for each MWh of renewable electricity generated in different proportions based on the type of technology used. Electricity suppliers can source ROCs from renewable electricity generators. ROCs are tradable certificates with no fixed price, and therefore, the amount an electricity supplier pays for a ROC is a matter for negotiation between the supplier and generator. As a result of the RO Scheme, our Generation segment receives ROCs that, as a vertically-integrated renewable energy generator, we can use in our Customers segment or sell to third parties. A proportion of the underlying electricity produced by our ROC-accredited units can be sold on a forward basis in order to improve the stability and visibility of our cash flows. 7 ----- We currently receive one ROC for each MWh of generation from three of our biomass-fired generation units, on top of the purchase price for the sale of electricity produced. ROC support for two of these units is grandfathered by the Government at the level of one ROC for each MWh of generation until March 2027. The number of ROCs earnt in any one period is capped based on an annual limit set by the Government based on estimated baseload generation for two units and a smaller allowance for the third unit. We optimise generation within this cap so as to generate more at times of higher system need, typically winter periods, which are also generally periods of higher power prices. Our most recently converted biomass-fired generation unit does not benefit from grandfathering but is still eligible to receive ROCs until March 2027. See “Industry Overview—UK _Clean Energy Legislation—Grandfathering of support under the Renewables Obligation”._ The RO Scheme was updated in July 2018, enabling us to optimise generation across the RO-accredited generation units of Drax Power Station (whether grandfathered or not) subject to an overall cap at the power station level (see “Industry Overview—UK clean energy legislation—Grandfathering of support under the Renewables _Obligation”). The flexibility afforded by the cap mitigates operational risks across our biomass-fired generation_ units, allowing us to use the spare generating capacity by increasing generation in one unit to cater for unplanned outages in another, thereby enabling us to deliver a more consistent generation and earnings profile from biomass generation. Some of our hydro facilities also receive support under the RO Scheme. We receive one ROC for each MWh of generation at our Lanark hydro facility and our Galloway hydro facility receives regulatory support from the RO Scheme with respect to approximately 28MW of its 109MW generating capacity at a rate of one ROC for each MWh of generation, which substantially enhances returns given the zero cost of fuel to operate the assets. _Generation capacity and system support_ With increasing levels of intermittent generation, we are continuing to identify opportunities to create value from our ability to flexibly operate our generation assets according to prevailing market conditions, such as short term power and the provision of System Support Services. To capture value in this market, we focus resources on optimising availability and flexibility of our biomass, pumped storage, hydro, gas and retiring coal generation assets. The System Operator is required to balance supply and demand and to ensure the secure and stable operation of the Transmission System. In addition to its operation of the Balancing Mechanism, it routinely contracts with generators to provide System Support Services. The diverse technologies and geographic spread of our generation portfolio means we are well placed to offer a range of System Support Services and provide an opportunity for further contract-based revenues. We are able to provide System Support Services to the System Operator, such as “frequency response” (altering output to ensure the frequency of electricity in the Transmission System is within statutory limits); “reactive power” services (enabling the System Operator to manage the voltage profile of the Transmission System within certain parameters); and, at our Cruachan pumped storage power plant, “Spin Gen” (enabling generation to commence at short notice if required by the System Operator). As the UK’s electricity market evolves, the types and tenor of System Support Services being procured by the System Operator is changing. For example, in January 2020, one of the Cruachan pumped storage hydro station’s four turbines secured a six-year contract to provide System Support Services to the UK electricity system, which commenced in July 2020 and is expected to result in contractbased revenues of approximately £29 million between 1 April 2020 and 31 March 2026 in aggregate. In addition, our Drax Power Station and Damhead Creek assets both provide foot room reserve services. We actively engage with the System Operator to offer System Support Services (either contracted or utilised in the Balancing Mechanism, collectively known as Balancing Services) to meet system needs such as “frequency response” (the automatic change in generation output to ensure the frequency of electricity in the Transmission System is within statutory limits); generating or absorbing “reactive power” (the means by which systems voltage is maintained within acceptable levels); reserve (the ability to increase or reduce generation to balance the Transmission System when instructed by the System Operator to do so; and restoration (the capability to assist in the Transmission System following a full or partial shutdown). The provision of these services is an important source of revenue for us, amounting to £51 million in the first half of 2020 (compared to £47 million in the first half of 2019). These figures include pumped storage wholesale power sales and pumping costs, which are undertaken when market prices are favourable. We continue to explore options for other existing or retiring generating assets in our fleet to provide similar such services in the future. In addition, our pipeline of development options which, if developed, would be well suited to provide these System Support Services to further support the UK electricity system. These options include the ability to 8 ----- increase capacity at our Cruachan pumped storage asset, the opportunity to develop our Damhead Creek II site into a 1.8GW CCGT plant, the development of up to four 299MW rapid response OCGT projects; and the repowering of the remaining two retiring coal-fired generation units at Drax Power Station to gas. Each of these options, if developed (which will be in line with our capital allocation policy whilst maintaining a conservative net leverage profile) would also improve our ability to provide many of these services. The UK has established a Capacity Market scheme to support the security and reliability of supply for the end consumer. The Capacity Market provides a payment for reliable sources of capacity alongside their electricity revenues, to ensure they deliver energy when needed. Existing generators which are successful in the auction receive a one-year Capacity Market agreement. Plants requiring significant refurbishment may also be eligible for three-year Capacity Market agreements. Potential new build generating stations may be eligible for 15-year Capacity Market agreements, if they meet certain criteria. Other types of capacity are eligible to participate, including interconnectors and demand side response. We have secured index-linked Capacity Market agreements for certain of our pumped storage, hydro and CCGT assets, which are expected to result in contract-based revenues in excess of £209.4 million in aggregate between January 2019 and 30 September 2024. We have similar agreements for our two coal-fired generation units until 30 September 2022 and the three small ancillary gas turbines located at Drax Power Station until 30 September 2024, which are expected to result in contract-based revenues of approximately £84.3 million between January 2019 and 30 September 2024 in aggregate. Included in the above is the contracts that were secured through participating in the T-3 Capacity Market Auction held in January 2020 and have provisionally secured agreements to provide approximately 2,333MW of de-rated capacity from our Damhead Creek, Rye House and Shoreham CCGT assets, the Drax gas turbines, the Cruachan pumped storage plant and the Galloway hydro power plant in the year commencing 1 October 2022. A T-4 Capacity Market Auction is due to be held in January 2021, for which the results of National Grid ESO’s prequalification process are expected in late October 2020. We will only accept a contract for participating development projects where it is economically attractive and in line with our capital allocation policy and adheres to a conservative net leverage profile. _A naturally hedged portfolio of generation assets and businesses through the value chain_ We are a multi-site, multi-technology operator and our ability to generate using a range of different technologies with different dispatch economics means we are less exposed to risks inherent to single technologies and movements in individual commodity prices. For example, if power prices and gas spreads fall due to high wind it will decrease the margin available at our thermal sites but the reduced number of thermal plants on the system is likely to increase the level of system support and balancing services required by National Grid, increasing the opportunities for pumped storage as well as the gas units through balancing market activities. At an operational level, we trade our generation assets as a single portfolio, leveraging our established expertise to optimise the running of our assets to maximise returns. We operate an integrated value chain across our three core segments (pellet production, generation and our Customers segment), enabling us to optimise the timing and delivery of sustainable business we produce to meet our renewable generation requirements at Drax Power Station. In turn, our Generation segment provides flexible, low-carbon and renewable electricity to our Customers segment for onward supply to business customers. _Hedging policy_ The earnings of our Generation segment are further supported by our long-term hedging policy pursuant to which we sell electricity generated up to two years in advance. This allows us to secure a margin on such electricity at times when margins for a given generation technology are attractive, thereby increasing visibility with respect to our future Generation segment earnings. As of 22 July 2020, we had contracted fixed price power sales (including both forward sold electricity and gas proxy hedges) of approximately 17.6TWh, 11.4TWh and 4.8TWh for delivery in 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Our average achieved prices for fixed price power sales of forward sold electricity in 2020, 2021 and 2022 were £53.8 per MWh, £49.0 per MWh and £48.2 per MWh, respectively. Our business is subject to risks due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, in particular, the weakening of sterling relative to other operational currencies, as most of the biomass we purchase is priced in US dollars, Canadian dollars or euro. We operate a long-term hedging policy with a five-year hedging period to manage the risk of a change in the relative values of the US dollar, Canadian dollar or euros relative to the pound sterling, which may increase our suppliers’ cost of business and ultimately our cost of goods sold with respect to biomass. 9 ----- _Increased control over fuel input costs via an integrated biomass supply chain_ Our wood pellet manufacturing facilities have a combined annual nameplate capacity of 1,475,000 tonnes, comprising capacity of 512,500 tonnes at each of our Amite and Morehouse facilities and 450,000 tonnes of capacity at our LaSalle facility, and have operated at or near nameplate capacity in the six months to 30 June 2020. Our US port facility in Baton Rouge, Louisiana has an annual export capacity of 2,100,000 tonnes (with the scope to expand further to 3,000,000 tonnes), which exceeds our current self-supply, enabling us to consolidate supply from third parties to drive further supply chain efficiencies until we are able to increase our selfsupply of biomass in the coming years. Our current US operations are strategically located near one another for operational efficiencies, including optimising the time and cost of wood pellet deliveries to our Baton Rouge port facility. In the first half of 2020, our wood pellet manufacturing facilities produced approximately 753,000 tonnes of wood pellets and our US port facility shipped 747,000 tonnes of wood pellets to Drax Power Station. In 2019, wood pellets manufactured at our own facilities accounted for 22 per cent. of the biomass used at Drax Power Station with the balance sourced from third party suppliers based in North America and Europe under a series of predominantly long-term contracts from sources also certified as sustainable. We aim to increase the amount of pellets we self-supply up to 5,000,000 tonnes per annum by 2027 (71 per cent. of our internal requirement for the year ended 31 December 2019). In furtherance of this aim, we are in the process of increasing capacity at our LaSalle, Amite and Morehouse facilities by 350,000 tonnes in aggregate over the next two years. In addition, over the same time period we expect to complete construction of three new satellite pellet plants, with nameplate capacity of 120,000 tonnes per year and the potential to increase this to 500,000 tonnes. We expect that the production costs at these plants will be approximately 20 per cent. lower than our existing plants. Our ability to source an increasing proportion of our biomass requirements internally via self-supply allows us to better manage the quality of feedstock and the timing of deliveries. This allows us to drive down the cost of biomass, but also enables us to optimise generation and reduce the risk of fuel shortages and supply chain issues curtailing generation from Drax Power Station. Further to this, it allows us to better ensure a stable cost of biomass and reduce exposure to commodity price fluctuations. At the same time, we maintain the flexibility to participate in the biomass spot market when prices are attractive. To date there has been no material impact from Covid-19 on our biomass supply chain or those of our key biomass suppliers, nor has there been any material disruption due to Covid-19 to the shipping of our biomass by sea freight, port or rail.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654
74_1,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Strengths,9.2.7,Strong financial metrics and conservative financial policies.,"Our balance sheet, liquidity and financial policy are strong. These have been maintained since we listed on the London Stock Exchange in December 2005, and is evidenced by our strong credit ratings from S&P, Fitch and DBRS. In recent years, as the Group has diversified and substantially grown, we have also reduced our business risk profile. Any temporary increase in leverage resulting from our corporate acquisitions have been followed by rapid deleveraging back to pre-acquisition levels. Our reported net leverage at the end of the last four calendar years has been between 0.7x and 1.8x. After the completion of the Opus Acquisition in February 2017, our consolidated pro forma net leverage as at 31 December 2016 only increased to 2.7x and decreased to 1.6x by the end of the calendar year; after the completion of the DGEL Acquisition in December 2018, our consolidated pro forma net leverage as at 31 December 2018 was 3.1x and decreased to 1.9x by 31 December 2019 and further decreased to 1.8x by 30 June 2020. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations— Significant Factors affecting Results of Operations”_ for a discussion of factors affecting comparability of information for the six months ended 30 June 2020 and 2019 and the years ended 31 December 2019 and 2018. We are committed to maintaining leverage at a level that is consistent with our current crossover credit rating, which supports our trading strategy. See “Presentation of Financial Information and Other Information— Non_IFRS Financial Measures”. We have a disciplined focus on cash flow and working capital management and have not utilised our cash revolving credit facilities for over two years. We have a strong cash conversion profile with an average annual operating cash conversion for the last four calendar years of approximately 125 per cent., reflecting ongoing low maintenance capital expenditure requirements combined with financial discipline. We announced our current dividend policy in June 2017, and this will pay a sustainable and growing dividend consistent with our commitment to a strong balance sheet and our ambitions for growth. 10 ----- We are focused on targeted selective investments which will help us continue diversifying our earnings and cash flow sources. We also expect our future maintenance capital expenditures to include investments to upgrade our facilities to, among other things, comply with applicable regulatory regimes, which we then expect to translate into greater operating cash flow going forward. Further, future investments to increase our biomass selfsupply capacity have been approved and will commence in the second half of 2020 in respect of three satellite plants. All decisions on investments and capital allocation are made in line with a prudent capital allocation policy. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Capital and _Operating Expenditure”._ We have robust credit policies in place to limit the amount of concentration risk we have with any counterparty (noting that the counterparty’s appetite to trade with us is itself based on its assessment of our credit profile). Sales to the Customers segment (as opposed to third parties) further reduce our concentration risk by spreading the Generation segment’s exposure to third-party credit risk across a wider customer base.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654
74_1,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Strengths,9.2.8,Our proven management team has led our business through an evolving regulatory and commodity market environment.,"We and our management team have proven experience in leading our business through an evolving regulatory environment, having delivered Europe’s largest decarbonization programme. Management is supported by a skilled operating team who are at the forefront of biomass conversion technology, including the mechanical, engineering, electrical and civil works required for such conversion. Through the conversion of four coal units to biomass at Drax Power Station, acquisitions and organic growth we have successfully transformed a coal generation business into a vertically-integrated generator focused on flexible, low-carbon and renewable electricity. As a result of this transformation, we are an industry-leader in energy generation from biomass and its associated supply chain. We have also gained significant experience in integrating businesses into our existing operations, in particular following our acquisition of Opus on 17 February 2017 and the DGEL Assets on 31 December 2018. The conversion of the first three of our generation units to biomass remains Europe’s largest decarbonisation project, and was delivered on time and within budget. This experience enabled us to deliver the low-cost conversion of a fourth biomass-fired generation unit in August 2018 and positions us to continue to deliver significant biomass cost-savings and growth projects, as well as providing Drax with the ability to adapt to an evolving energy market and deliver on our pipeline of development projects. Our operational experience in handling biomass is also market-leading. We have developed innovative fuel handling systems, logistics and storage solutions for biomass fuel as well as a bespoke, technically-advanced covered rail wagon with a specialised door design and a patented product flow control system to manage biomass during discharge. Further, we have developed an in-depth understanding of the scientific and technological effects of burning a range of biomass fuels, as well as of the critical combustion characteristics of such fuels. This positions us to identify and utilize new fuels (such as sugar cane and bagasse) at a reduced cost to the wood pellets we currently procure from third parties. Sustainability is at the heart of our culture and the sustainable sourcing of biomass is a core principle of the Group. We aim to lead in this area and, in 2017 we appointed a Senior Independent Non-Executive Director with expertise in sustainability. In 2019, we introduced a new Responsible Sourcing Policy for Biomass, which reflects the evolving science in the area and is based on recommendations by Forest Research and the European Climate Foundation, and which exceeds the requirements of the EU Renewable Energy Directive II. We also established an Independent Advisory Board chaired by Sir John Beddington, the UK’s former Chief Scientific Adviser, and including members of Forest Research. The IAB provides independent advice on the role of biomass in climate change mitigation and in supporting the transition to a net zero energy system, forest science and optimising carbon impacts, and societal expectations for responsible and sustainable biomass. The Independent Advisory  Board  has  reviewed  our  biomass  policy  and  confirmed  that  it  reflects  the recommendations made by Forest Research. We seek to source biomass from countries with large areas of growing forests and established forest industries and we comprehensively audit our carbon footprint across our entire biomass supply chain, conduct regular ISAE 3000 assured independent supplier audits and encourage the use of third party sustainability certification. All our biomass is procured in accordance with our Responsible Sourcing Policy for Biomass. 11 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,654
74_1,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Strategy,9.3.1,Create a long-term future for sustainable biomass.,"The cost of biomass fuel is a key metric in determining the profitability of our biomass generation and our overall financial performance. We have a target to substantially reduce this cost by 2027 through increasing our self-supply of sustainable wood pellets, increasing our operational efficiency and developing a wider fuel envelope. In doing so, we expect to develop a long-term future for sustainable biomass. Our wood pellet manufacturing facilities in the US currently supply all of their output to Drax Power Station and supplied 1,535,000 tonnes (22 per cent.) of our internal requirements for generation from sustainable biomass in 2019. Our target is to increase this self-supply capability to 5,000,000 (71 per cent. of our internal requirement for the year ended 31 December 2019) by 2027, and in doing so become the world’s largest low-cost biomass producer and improve the certainty of self-supply, allowing us to take advantage of economies of scale and making us less susceptible to changes in the wholesale price of biomass. In furtherance of this target, we are increasing capacity at our LaSalle, Amite and Morehouse facilities by 350,000 tonnes in aggregate over the next two years (construction has started at LaSalle and Morehouse, and is expected to begin at Amite in 2021). Our current wood pellet manufacturing facilities are strategically located close to one another in the US Gulf region for operational and supply chain efficiencies. We intend to continue consolidating supply from third parties at our Baton Rouge port facility to utilise unused export capacity and to drive further supply chain efficiencies. Progress in the first half of 2020 included the approval of three new 40kt satellite plants at a cost of approximately $40 million in aggregate ($10-15 million per site). Construction work on the first plant is set to begin this year, which will utilise sawmill residues and share our existing US Gulf infrastructure to produce, we believe, biomass at around 20 per cent. below the current cost of production. Separately, we are undertaking a number of operational, technical and logistical initiatives across our biomass supply chain to further reduce the cost of biomass. This includes increasing the proportion of good quality wood pellets received at Drax Power Station, turbine upgrades and process modifications to improve combustion at Drax Power Station and improving our logistics. For example, in May 2019, we commissioned a new rail spur linking our LaSalle facility to the regional rail network and our port facility at Baton Rouge, which will increase transportation efficiency and economies of scale and reduce the cost and carbon footprint of our operations. Together with the Port of Baton Rouge and the State of Louisiana, we are also commissioning an enlarged chambering yard at our port facilities in Baton Rouge, allowing 80-car train sets to operate from our LaSalle and Morehouse sites. Following the success of the co-location of a sawmill next to our LaSalle facility, which became operational in January 2020, we are looking at identifying additional opportunities to locate sawmills near to our pellet facilities, in order to increase operational efficiency, secure low-cost fibre residues and ultimately to reduce the cost of biomass production. This programme of improvements is expected to deliver savings of $27 million per year by the end of 2020 and $64 million per year by the end of 2022. In addition to the above, we aim to leverage our knowledge of fuel chemistry obtained from our sustainable biomass generation to widen the sustainable biomass fuel options which we are able to use at Drax Power Station. We have set up a dedicated team tasked with identifying new fuels (such as sugarcane bagasse, woodchips and nutshells), forms and geographies which we could utilise at a reduced cost to the pellets we currently procure from third parties.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654
74_1,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Strategy,9.3.2,Delivering on our ambition to become a carbon negative company by 2030 through BECCS.,"Delivering on BECCS will also leave us well placed to fulfil our longer-term ambition of becoming a carbon negative group by 2030. To deliver on this carbon negative ambition we are developing a range of engineering options and working with a range of technology and industrial partners to apply BECCS technology to the biomass units at Drax Power Station. This technology will safely capture the vast majority of the carbon dioxide emitted in the biomass generation process and transports it via pipelines to storage sites under the North Sea. Our BECCS ambition aligns with the Government’s target to achieve net zero emissions across the UK economy by 2050 and the advice of its statutory advisory body, the CCC, which highlights that BECCS is both a critical part of the solution to achieve net zero whilst also being part of an evolving, stable and flexible generation mix. Each biomass unit utilising BECCS technology could capture approximately 4,000,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per annum. Working in partnership with a range of stakeholders, and with the right support from Government, we believe we are well placed to develop BECCS at scale in advance of 2030 and, in all, could provide up to a third of the negative emissions that the CCC has identified that the UK may require. 12 ----- We also expect global demand for wood pellets to increase this decade as other countries develop decarbonisation programmes which acknowledge the benefits of sustainable biomass for generation. Whilst there is an abundance of sustainable biomass globally, there remains limited capacity to convert these fibres to energy dense pellets, which have a low-carbon footprint and lower cost associated with transportation. As a result, we expect the global market for biomass to remain structurally short. We are therefore exploring options to service biomass demand in other markets, such as Europe, North America and Asia alongside the UK. In doing so, we are creating optionality over our use of sustainable biomass. The technology to deliver post-combustion BECCS exists and is proven at scale. We recently commenced a trial of one such technology provided by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries at the technology testing zone at Drax Power Station. This solvent technology is well established and is being used at 13 sites globally, notably at the Petra Nova facility in Texas, USA, the world’s largest post-combustion carbon capture plant, which is capable of capturing 1,400,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year. We are piloting the carbon capture potential of an organic and potentially lower cost alternative solvent treatment developed by C-Capture Limited, and we expect to carry out further trials in 2021. This technology is also being piloted at the Tiller facility in Norway. We are also exploring the viability of alternative uses for CO2 including trials to assess use of biogenic CO2 in plastic and animal food use, and the development of synthetic zero-carbon fuels from hydrogen. Subject to the right support from the Government, we stand ready to develop and deliver this critical contribution to the UK achieving net zero emissions by 2050, which will also help us to achieve our ambition of becoming a carbon negative company by 2030.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654
74_1,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Strategy,9.3.3,Be the leading provider of system support in the UK.,"Historically, the vast majority of the Group’s earnings were derived from the operation of Drax Power Station as a merchant plant, selling wholesale power independently to third parties. Accordingly, the Group’s earnings were volatile and exposed to commodity price and/or merchant risk. In recent years, our earnings have diversified and the Group’s exposure to commodity price risk has been substantially reduced. In the Generation segment, we maintain our visibility of future earnings and cash flows through the contracted earnings of Capacity Market and System Support Services payments. We expect that, combined with the support we receive under the CfD Regime and RO Scheme for our biomass and hydro generation assets, this will continue to result in a reduced level of commodity markets exposure and increased stability and visibility of earnings. We have secured index-linked Capacity Market agreements for certain of our pumped storage, hydro and CCGT assets, which are expected to result in contract-based revenues in excess of £209.4 million in aggregate between January 2019 and 30 September 2024. We have similar agreements for our two coal-fired generation units until 30 September 2022 and the three small ancillary gas turbines located at Drax Power Station until 30 September 2024, which are expected to result in contract-based revenues of approximately £84.3 million between January 2019 and 30 September 2024 in aggregate. Looking forward, any final investment decision in respect of any one of our pipeline of development options will be subject to appropriate support to deliver stable contract-based revenues in line with our capital allocation policy whilst maintaining a conservative net leverage profile. With increasing levels of intermittent generation on the UK electricity system, we are continuing to identify opportunities to flexibly operate our generation assets according to prevailing market conditions, such as the provision of short-term power and balancing market activity and the provision of other System Support Services. The flexible, dispatchable and responsive nature of our generation assets positions us to compete in the market over the short and medium term and our pipeline of development projects will, if developed, further bolster our offering in this regard. With the changing grid dynamic, we expect the market for System Support Services to grow. As the UK’s electricity market evolves, the types and tenor of System Support Services being procured by the System Operator is changing. For example, in January 2020, one of the Cruachan pumped storage hydro station’s four turbines secured a six-year contract to provide System Support Services to the UK electricity system, which commenced in July 2020 and is expected to result in contract-based revenues of approximately £29 million between 1 April 2020 and 31 March 2026 in aggregate. In addition, our Drax Power Station and Damhead Creek assets both provide foot room reserve services. It is our intention to offer further assets to tender for similar 13 ----- System Support Services in the future and we will continue to position the business so that it is able to meet the requirements of an increasingly complex UK electricity system.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

In the same way that the Generation segment provides system support, so too can our industrial customer portfolio. Over time, we expect this business, through efficiency and demand-side response, to contribute increasingly to system support. We continue to believe this approach will support long-term growth. Our Customers segment was the fifth largest supplier of electricity to businesses in the UK by volume supplied as of 30 April 2020, was the largest provider of renewable energy to businesses and the UK leading business to business only supplier. As at 30 April 2020, we supplied 281,500 electricity and gas meters and, in the six months ended 30 June 2020, we supplied 8.8TWh of electricity and gas and our fuel mix disclosure for the period April 2019 to March 2020 100 per cent of our electricity was from renewable generation. As at 30 April 2020, our share of the B2B electricity market was 8 per cent.. As the power system decarbonises, we believe that there is a significant opportunity for the Group to leverage our status as a vertically integrated utility with a diverse range of assets to provide an evolving range of innovative and flexible solutions to business customers enabling them to manage their energy demand and requirements, which will drive market share growth and increased profitability in the Customers segment. In the first half of 2020, the Customers segment reported a loss. This reflects the significant reduction in demand caused by Covid-19, the cost associated with exiting hedged positions as market prices have fallen and the increased risk and provisioning for business failure and bad debt—principally in the SME market, which represents 30 per cent. of monthly billing. The combined revenues for Opus Energy Limited and Opus Gas Supply Limited, which supply SME customers, were £626.8 million in 2019, 27 per cent. of our £2.35 billion total revenues in the Customers business. We estimate that there is approximately £100 million of SME revenue within the Haven Power Limited revenues in 2019, which would increase this to 31 per cent. However, even with social distancing measures eased we expect the impact of Covid-19 to continue in the second half of 2020 and 2021. Despite the Covid-19 pandemic, the I&C business performed better and has added long dated contracts with water utilities to the portfolio, providing revenue visibility over the next five years. Looking beyond the impact of Covid-19 we will continue to monitor the portfolio to ensure alignment with the Group’s strategy. The Customers business has a differentiated market position—selling purely renewable power while helping over 2,000 independent renewable generators, access the market.

As of 30 June 2020, after giving pro forma effect to the Offering, as if it had occurred on that date, the Restricted Subsidiaries of DGHL that will not guarantee the Notes would have had no outstanding third- party Indebtedness. The Guarantees of the Guarantors may be released as set forth under “Note Guarantees—Release of Note Guarantees”.

See “Use of Proceeds”.

74_1,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Facilities Agreement”). The Senior Facilities Agreement comprises a £315 million committed multicurrency revolving credit facility and,9.5.1,,"a drawn £35 million term facility (the “Senior Facilities”). The original borrower under the Senior Facilities Agreement is Drax Corporate Limited. The Senior Facilities are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Guarantors (other than Drax Corporate Limited) and the Issuer and are secured by the same Collateral that secures the ESG Facility, the Private Placement Facilities, the 2022 Notes, 2025 Notes and the Term Facilities and that will secure the Notes. In the event of enforcement or certain distressed disposals, any liabilities in respect of obligations under the Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations and liabilities to lenders or creditors under certain other indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the Indentures (subject to the Intercreditor Agreement) and then outstanding will receive priority in relation to any proceeds received from the Collateral. We are currently contemplating a potential amendment and restatement of the Senior Facilities Agreement, which may include a reduction in the commitments under the Revolving Facility to £300 million and an extension of the maturity until 31 January 2025 with a discretionary extension option of 1 year (until 31 January 2026).

For more information on the terms of the ESG Facility Agreement, please see “Description of Certain Financing _Arrangements—ESG Facility Agreement”._ (9) On 18 August 2020, we entered into a term loan facilities agreement between, amongst others, Drax Corporate Limited as borrower, DGHL as parent guarantor and Banco Santander S.A., London Branch as facility agent (the “Term Facilities Agreement”). The Term 16 ----- Facilities Agreement comprises a €126.5 million and £45 million term facility available in six tranches (the “Term Facilities”). The Term Facilities are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Guarantors and the Issuer and are secured by the same Collateral that secures the Senior Facilities, the Private Placement Facilities, the 2022 Notes, 2025 Notes and the ESG Facility and that will secure the Notes. Pursuant to the Term Facilities Agreement, the commitments under Facility F in the amount of €31.5 million will expire after 3 November 2020. Accordingly, on or prior to that date, we expect to submit a request to draw €31.5 million under the Term Loan Facilities, to be funded on or before 13 November 2020, which is the final utilisation date under Facility F. We expect the proceeds thereof to be used for general corporate purposes.

Such hedging arrangements may, in the future, also be entered into by other members of the Group. In the event of enforcement or certain distressed disposals, any liabilities in respect of obligations under the Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations (including under the currency, interest rate and inflation hedging referred to above) and liabilities to lenders or creditors under certain other indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the Indentures (subject to the Intercreditor Agreement) and then outstanding will receive priority in relation to any proceeds of certain distressed disposals or enforcement of the Collateral.

The effect of excluding certain remeasurements from results of operations is to reflect commodity sales and purchases at contracted prices— i.e., at the all-in-hedged amount paid or received in respect of the delivery of the commodity in question. (2) We define Adjusted EBITDA as profit/loss for the year before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, excluding the impact of exceptional items and certain remeasurements. As a result of the temporary suspension of the Capacity Market, Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended 30 June 2019 does not include £36 million of Capacity Market income due in respect of the first half of the year that was not recognised until the reinstatement of the Capacity Market in November 2019, and Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended 31 December 2019 includes £6.8 million related to the period in 2018 subsequent to the Capacity Market suspension. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported under IFRS. See “Presentation of Financial Information and Other Information—Non-IFRS Financial _Measures” for more information.

As a result of the temporary suspension of the Capacity Market, Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended 30 June 2019 does not include £36 million of Capacity Market income due in respect of the first half of the year that was not recognised until the reinstatement of the Capacity Market in November 2019, and Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended 31 December 2019 includes £6.8 million related to the period in 2018 subsequent to the Capacity Market suspension.

The Issuer is a finance company that conducts no business operations of its own and as of the Issue Date its only material assets will be its rights and claims under various intercompany financings (including under the New Proceeds Loan) and its only material liabilities will be its outstanding indebtedness (including its obligations under the Notes, the 2022 Notes and the 2025 Notes, as well as its guarantees in respect of the Senior Facilities Agreement, the ESG Facility Agreement, the Private Placement Agreement, the Term Facilities Agreement and certain hedging obligations). For further information, please see “Summary—Corporate and Financing Structure”, “Our Business” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements”. Unless otherwise indicated, this Offering Memorandum does not include any historical financial information relating to the Issuer. This Offering Memorandum presents consolidated financial information for the Group on the level of Drax Group plc, the immediate holding company of DGHL. Drax Group plc will not be subject to the restrictive covenants under the Indenture, will not provide a Guarantee in favour of the Notes and will not grant security in favour of the Notes, except with respect to the shares it owns in DGHL and certain receivables owed to Drax Group plc by members of the Group. Drax Group plc is a holding company and as at 30 June 2020 its only material assets and liabilities were its interest in the issued and outstanding shares of DGHL, its rights and obligations under the Shareholder Support Agreement and a net intercompany liability (including the balance of intercompany liabilities and intercompany receivables) of £30.1 million and cash of £51.6 million. The following tables present summary historical consolidated financial data for Drax Group plc as at and for the six months ended 30 June 2020 and 2019 and the years ended 31 December 2019 and 2018. Unless otherwise specified, the summary historical consolidated financial data of Drax Group plc as of and for the six months ended 30 June 2020 and 2019 have been derived from the 2020 Drax Group Unaudited Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum and the summary historical consolidated financial data of Drax Group plc as of and for the years ended 31 December 2019 and 2018 have been derived from the 2019 Drax Group Audited Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The financial information of the Group as of and for the year ended 31 December 2018 (i) includes the assets and liabilities of the DGEL Group acquired in connection with the DGEL Acquisition in the Drax Group’s balance sheet as of 31 December 2018 and (ii) does not include income, expenditure or cash flows of the DGEL Group. The 2019 Drax Group Audited Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”). The following tables also present historical consolidated financial data for Drax Group plc for the twelve months ended 30 June 2020, which were calculated by adding the unaudited condensed consolidated financial information for the six months ended 30 June 2020 to the audited consolidated financial information for the year ended 31 December 2019 extracted from the Group’s audited financial statements as of and for the year ended 31 December 2019, and subtracting the unaudited condensed consolidated financial information for the six months ended 30 June 2019. As discussed in Note 19 to the 2020 Drax Group Unaudited Financial Statements, the unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended 30 June 2019 have been restated to reflect adjustments resulting from (i) the finalisation of the acquisition date fair values of assets and liabilities of the DGEL Group acquired on 31 December 2018, as the finalisation of the terms of the defined benefit pension scheme transfer resulted in a reduction in the net opening surplus recognised by £1.1 million, and the finalisation of the Group’s assessment of cash-generation units (“CGUs”) and their fair values resulted in a net reduction in property, plant and equipment values by £0.2 million and a reduction in deferred tax liabilities by £0.1 million; these adjustments had corresponding impacts on goodwill, (ii) the correction of a historical error identified in respect of the translation of fixed assets in our US-based business into the Group’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended 31 December 2019, as the application of the correct foreign exchange rates resulted in an increase in fixed asset carrying values at 30 June 2019 and 1 January 2019 of £56.6 million and £55.5 million, respectively, with an equivalent amount recognised in the translation reserve; the correction has no impact on profit or cash amounts, and (iii) a change in the presentation of amounts in relation to rebased foreign currency exchange contracts in the balance sheet, which resulted in a £42.9 million reduction in derivative assets and a £42.9 million reduction in deferred income in the balance sheet as of 30 June 2019. 25 ----- Furthermore, as discussed in Note 8.3 to the 2019 Drax Group Audited Financial Statements, the unaudited comparative information as of and for the year ended 31 December 2018 included in the 2019 Drax Group Audited Financial Statements has been restated to reflect the same adjustments described in (i) and (ii) above, as follows: (x) adjustments to the fair value of assets and liabilities as set for in clause (i) above and, as a result of the conclusion of the completion statement process, an increase in consideration of £4.8 million and an increase in the net financial assets acquired of £2.5 million, with a corresponding £2.3 million increase in goodwill and (y) the correction as set forth in (ii) above, resulting in an increase in fixed asset carrying values at 1 January and 31 December 2018 of £37.8 million and £55.5 million, respectively, with an equivalent amount recognised in the translation reserve; the correction has no impact on profit or cash amounts. In this Offering Memorandum, we present consolidated balance sheet information as of 30 June 2020 and 31 December 2018 on a restated basis. The financial information below includes certain Non-IFRS Measures used to evaluate the Group’s economic and financial performance.

Its quantum therefore increases proportionally to the scarcity of ROCs in any given compliance period. Many of our contracts for the sale of ROCs to suppliers contain provisions that require the supplier to pay a fixed upfront fee and then an additional fee at a later date equal to the proportion of the recycle fund that is received by the supplier from Ofgem following submission of the purchased ROCs. If renewable output differs materially from DBEIS’s expectations, more or fewer ROCs will have been generated during the compliance period than forecast, which will affect the level of the recycle payment. This volatility increases the difficulty in forecasting the expected pay-out from the RO buy-out fund. There is, therefore, inherent uncertainty in the amount of recycle benefit to which we will be entitled and, while we may attempt to hedge our exposure to any fluctuations in the amount of recycle benefit from wind, any significant fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

In 2018 and 2019 this led to mutualisation of costs associated with the RO Scheme and SS-FiT, which increased our cost of sales by £3.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2018 and £0.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2019. A similar mutualisation process was invoked in respect of costs associated with the Capacity Market in the fourth financial quarter of 2019, which increased our cost of sales by £0.7 million. In all these circumstances, the remaining energy suppliers are obligated to make up the shortfall. 56 ----- Further energy supplier failures to pay such costs, including costs associated with the Capacity Market could lead to further industry cost mutualisation.

Demand for gas in the Customers segment is also dependent on weather, with periods of cold weather usually resulting in an increase in demand. In addition, revenue from the sale of ROCs is subject to annual patterns. Generators typically sell ROCs to suppliers for delivery and payment in the months of June or July following the end of the relevant compliance period as suppliers need to submit the ROCs to Ofgem by the end of August following the end of the compliance period. Therefore, the results of a single financial half-year may not be a reliable basis for the expectations of a full fiscal year and may not be comparable with the results in other financial half-years.

In particular as we seek to expand our self-supply of biomass to five million tonnes per annum, we will take a greater market share of a relatively small market which could bring our business under greater scrutiny under anti-competition laws and regulations. Our ambitions to self-supply five million tonnes of biomass per annum include proposals to develop a biomass trading capability that may also involve the supply of biomass to third parties. This is a market which we do not currently operate within on a large scale as currently we only sell biomass when we have a surplus relative to projected generation.

Attempts may be made to gain unauthorised access to, or deliberately breach, our IT systems in order, for example, to manipulate our proprietary business data or customer information.

Examples of such data include information identifying a person as a customer by reference to an identifier such as a name, address, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that person. In the ordinary course of business, we also collect, transmit and store employee data, including dates of birth and medical information as well as business contact data of suppliers. Our use of this personal data is subject to laws, regulations and guidance designed to protect personal data that a business processes, including, among others, the EU-wide General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which came into force on 25 May 2018 and was substantively transposed into UK law by the Data Protection Act 2018 (the “DPA”, and together with the GDPR, the “2018 Laws”), which imposes significant compliance obligations. The 2018 Laws implement more stringent operational requirements for controllers and processors of personal data than the previous legislative framework, including, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used and more extensive rights for individuals in relation to their personal data. The Information Commissioner’s Office (the “Regulator”) now has more extensive enforcement powers including the ability to impose larger fines of up to €20 million or up to 4 per cent. of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. Privacy is a fundamental human right and individuals are more likely to complain or bring a claim over misuse of their personal data. If a significant or widely publicised unlawful disclosure of employee or customer data were to occur, whether as a result of a failure of our IT security systems, employee negligence or wilful act or the actions of our suppliers, our reputation may be adversely affected, employee, customer or investor confidence may be diminished and we may be subject to legal claims by individuals, fines or other enforcement action by the Regulator. Company directors can also be disqualified following material breaches. Additionally, individuals who are the subject of the personal data have much more control over their personal data under the 2018 Laws and if there is a failure to accommodate the exercise of their expanded individual rights, then similar consequences could flow from such failures. The 2018 Laws also place responsibility on the business to ensure that its suppliers, third party intermediaries and contractors have appropriate safeguards in place against data breaches and comply with the principles of data protection. This applies across the entirety of our business portfolio and means that we must take steps to ensure that third parties we share personal data with and that we control also comply with the 2018 Laws, in particular where there are any international transfers or accessing of personal data outside the UK/EEA. This can be difficult to manage as we do not have control of such third parties’ IT security systems and any breaches could cause reputational damage for our business. We therefore have to carry out due diligence of relevant third parties and ensure appropriate data protection terms are in our agreements with them. In relation to 58 ----- an international transfer risk, the UK will need to become a European Commission ‘approved country’ to continue to receive EU citizen personal data at the end of the Transition Period and there is a risk that this approval process will not be completed within the Transition Period. If this approval is not forthcoming, UK businesses will need to enter into an alternative transfer mechanism to be compliant. The main alternative transfer mechanism, the EU Model Clause Agreement, was challenged in the EU but was found to be adequate. There was a specific transfer mechanism between the EU and US, namely the Privacy Shield, which (in the same challenge) was invalidated. Organisations that transfer personal data to the US relying upon the Privacy Shield are reviewing those arrangements and adopting EU Model Contractual Clauses. There is a risk that the Regulator may take action in the meantime but to date, the Regulator has not taken any enforcement action and guidance is awaited. The 2018 Laws also introduce other obligations, such as having procedures in place to ensure privacy by design and default to minimise the collection of personal data, to ensure data is accurate and up to date and to ensure data is appropriately protected and is not kept for longer than necessary. In addition, there is an increased need to have relevant processes and systems to respond adequately to the exercise of individual rights including subject access requests and erasure requests. Above all, we are required to demonstrate our accountability in relation to the personal data we process. A failure to comply with these obligations or put in place adequate procedures may result in fines or other regulator sanctions. Recent developments in case law in the UK suggest that energy generators may be considered public sector bodies for the purpose of the Environmental Information Regulations 2004. This could result in information access requests being made by the public for information which previously may not have been disclosed willingly into the public domain such as emission levels and other environmental matters.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

The unplanned departure of any of our executive officers or key employees could have a negative impact on our operations, including possibly adversely affecting our ability to provide the service levels our customers expect. This risk is particularly true with respect to electricity regulation and the renewable energy industry. Electricity regulation and trading is a highly specialised field with a limited pool of qualified and experienced personnel while the renewable energy industry is a highly specialised and relatively new industry and, as a result, there is a limited pool of technically qualified personnel, particularly outside London. Certain of our generation assets are in remote locations and require employees with sufficient technical engineering and operational expertise to maintain and operate them safely and optimally. We compete with a number of companies as well as Government entities and other organisations for such personnel and, consequently, we have encountered and may continue to encounter difficulties in retaining certain key employees and attracting new personnel. Any such difficulty in retaining and/or attracting key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

Such breach or circumvention may include, for example, inadvertent or careless mistakes or intentional acts or misrepresentations by our employees or agents, breaches of applicable laws or regulations in the course of their duties, breaches of operational guidelines or other improper acts. Any such misconduct could have an impact on our reputation and our relationship with our regulators and other stakeholders or lead to regulatory or legal action, which in turn could adversely affect our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. The customers, suppliers, financial institutions, contractors and other third parties that we do business with may not fulfil their obligations to us and may expose us to credit and operational risks, which could adversely affect our financial position. _Credit Risk_ We purchase from and sell commodities to a range of counterparties in a number of different countries. Collateral is not required from all counterparties and the failure of one or more of these counterparties to perform its contractual obligations might lead to reduced profits for us or result in us incurring additional costs in replacing the relevant transactions. We may also find ourselves unable to procure or sell replacement commodities elsewhere. We derived revenues of £575.7 million in 2019 and £555.8 million in 2018 from one individual customer that represented 12.2 and 13.1 per cent of total consolidated revenue respectively for the period. These revenues arose in the Generation segment. A default by one of these customers could lead to such customer failing to make a substantial payment to us, thereby causing a loss of revenue and adversely affecting our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. The failure of one or more of the large customers in our Customers segment (who are generally not required to deliver collateral in respect of their contractual obligations) may lead to bad debts and, consequently, reduced profits for us, particularly if the electricity or gas then needs to be sold in the market at a lower price than that previously contracted. We are also exposed to the credit risk of banks that hold our deposits and of financial counterparties with whom we hedge foreign exchange, commodity price, interest rate or inflation rate exposures. Our foreign exchange exposures are routinely hedged in line with our hedging policy and so any default or insolvency of a counterparty could lead to a failure by such counterparty to make termination payments payable to us and an inability to obtain sufficient replacement currency to enable us to meet our liabilities in a particular jurisdiction on a timely basis. _Operational Counterparty Risk_ The nascent nature of the biomass supply market means that a number of our third party biomass suppliers business are subject to degree of financial uncertainty. There is a risk that these biomass suppliers may default on their supply obligations and, in such circumstances, the potential for us to recover our losses as a result of a supplier default may be limited. A default by one of our main biomass suppliers could lead to such supplier failing to deliver biomass to us, causing a loss of revenue and adversely affecting our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

This risk is particularly acute because most of our revenue and gross profit for 2019 was derived from the sale of electricity produced from biomass generation and the subsidies related thereto (in the form of ROCs earned by Drax Power Station or CfD payments). As protection against operating hazards, we maintain insurance cover against some, but not all, of the potential losses which may arise. There is no assurance that catastrophic or other events relating to uninsured or uninsurable risks will not occur. Furthermore, if we suffer a loss in relation to an insured risk, there is no guarantee that the amount of insurance protection to which we would be contractually entitled will be sufficient to cover the entire loss incurred. Insurance, warranties or performance guarantees may not cover all or any lost revenues or increased expenses from business interruptions or other events. If we suffer an uninsured or underinsured loss, this could adversely affect our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. As would be expected with a Group of this size we have a series of minor incidents that may result in either a property damage or business interruption claim. Insurance cover for particular risks or limits of indemnity may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or cost. It is possible that in the future insurance providers may no longer wish to insure businesses in the biomass or coal industry against certain risks, or may charge generators significantly higher premiums for such cover. Moreover, if one of our operating facilities were to suffer an insured loss, the insurance proceeds received by us might not be sufficient to cover the business loss, or to repair and reinstate the affected facilities, or to satisfy liabilities to third parties.

We and our pension scheme trustees aim to meet the defined benefit liabilities from a combination of sources including investment returns and cash contributions from Drax Power and DGEL, the respective sponsoring companies, in respect of ongoing benefit accrual and deficit repair contributions for Drax Power. Each defined benefit scheme is exposed to risks relating to interest rates, inflation, returns on assets and the longevity of scheme members and as such a mismatch between asset and liability value movements. The defined benefit scheme’s investment portfolio contains a proportion of assets that are expected to provide a better return in the long term than alternative investments such as gilts; however, in the short term, the difference between the value of liabilities and assets may vary significantly, potentially resulting in an increase in the funding requirements. The current business environment, with low long-term interest rates, long-term gilt yields, corporate bond yields, equity values and credit spreads, could also affect the value of the deficit having to be recognised. Furthermore, a quicker than expected increase in life expectancy and/or employee pensionable salaries increasing above the rates assumed in the previous scheme valuation could increase the defined benefit liabilities. Further changes in the accounting standards relating to defined benefit pension liabilities could also lead to an increasing accounting deficit arising in our defined benefit pension scheme, albeit this would not impact the funding requirement. As of 31 December 2019, our Drax Power Defined Benefit Pension Scheme had a surplus of £3.1 million (compared to a surplus of £18.9 million as of 31 December 2018). Our DGEL defined benefit pension scheme was set up in 2019 following the DGEL Acquisition for certain employees with defined benefit pension rights that were transferred to the Group and had an initial restated surplus of £2.7 million increasing to £3.9 million as of 31 December 2019. As of 31 December 2019, a decrease of 0.25 per cent. in the discount rate or an increase of 0.25 per cent. in the inflation rate would have resulted in decreases in the net surplus under the defined benefit schemes of £18.2 million and £14.9 million, respectively. Also, as of 31 December 2019, an increase in life expectancy by one year would have resulted in a decrease in our net surplus under the defined benefit pension schemes of £13.3 million. 61 ----- Our defined benefit pension scheme is subject to triennial actuarial valuations, with the next valuation for the Drax Power Defined Benefit Scheme scheduled for a March 2021 balance sheet date and for the DGEL Defined Benefit Scheme for a March 2020 balance sheet date. The level of funding deficit calculated at the time could, subject to agreement between us and the pension scheme trustees, result in additional deficit repair contributions being required or possibly our offering more contingent assets or asset-backed contributions as further security. Any requirement to make significant immediate cash contributions into our defined benefit scheme to cover any such deficit could adversely affect our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Unanticipated actions by the pension regulator and/or any material revisions to existing pensions legislation could require accelerated and increased contributions to our defined benefit scheme which may restrict our financial flexibility.

On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organisation confirmed that its spread and severity had escalated to the point of pandemic. The Covid-19 pandemic, and the governmental and regulatory actions taken to mitigate its effects, has had a significant impact on many aspects of society and the global economy, and the duration and depth of this impact remain uncertain. 62 ----- The resulting market environment has led to a reduction in demand for power and gas during 2020, an increase in the costs of selling pre-contracted power back into the market, an increase in third party costs (e.g. Balancing Services Use of System charges, which relate to the costs of the day-to-day operation of the transmission system), a reduction in the amount of units of energy supplied and hence margin realized, and the increased risk of business failure and bad debt in the businesses we supply, all of which to date have primarily impacted our Customers segment. In the first half of 2020, our Customers segment reported a loss at an Adjusted EBITDA level of £37 million, which reflected the significant reduction in demand due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the costs associated with exiting hedged positions in the context of falling market prices and the increased risk of business failure and bad debt. Each of these, and other developments such as sustained local lockdown measures and those which have not yet been identified due to the uncertainties associated with Covid-19, could adversely affect our business. We have undertaken Covid-19 risk assessments in all parts of our business and have adjusted our working practices, by introducing widespread remote working and by implementing measures to safeguard all those who are still required to attend our operational sites to ensure compliance with the Government guidelines. Planned outages at our generation facilities have become more costly and time-consuming as a result of the physical restrictions required due to Covid-19, and the same would be the case for forced outages. Future projects and facilities upgrades may be cancelled or delayed as a result of Covid-19. We may take further actions required or advised by authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, contractors or suppliers. There is no certainty that such measures (or the measures that we have already put in place) will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by Covid-19, and the implementation of such measures (or their insufficiency) could harm our ability to perform critical functions. The unavailability of staff could adversely impact our operations, the continuity of service to customers and our reputation. As at the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Covid-19 pandemic has had significant impacts on the financial markets. The associated principal risks to us as a result of this volatility in the financial markets include weaker sterling affecting the cost of biomass in the long-term (over the next five years, the Group has forward hedged its currency requirements for its contracted and expected biomass requirements, protecting the Group from currency driven movements in biomass cost) and the liquidity risk associated with potential increases in borrowing costs and the availability of debt financing. The further economic impact of Covid-19 will depend on the continuing spread of the virus and the responses of the authorities and the global community. The degree to which the pandemic continues to impact our results will depend on future developments, which, as at the date of this Offering Memorandum, are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. These developments may include, but are not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, its severity, actions taken to contain the virus or treat its impact, the extent and effectiveness of economic stimulus packages and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. In the medium- to long-term, if the spread of Covid-19 is prolonged, or new diseases emerge that give rise to similar macroeconomic effects, macroeconomic conditions will be adversely affected and could lead to further economic downturn in the countries in which we operate and the global economy more broadly (which could be widespread, severe and long lasting). Our supply chain has been disrupted as a result of the pandemic. As at the date of this Offering Memorandum, we have delayed some investments in our biomass supply chain due to the impact of Covid-19. Further, whilst our suppliers have largely managed to mitigate the impact of Covid-19, this position could deteriorate and result in disruption to the supply chain and the associated economic downturn could put us at increased risk of supplier failure. We continue to monitor and assess developments and the potential impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance.

We intend to repay the 2022 Notes in full before 31 December 2020. See “Use of Proceeds”. (2) The Senior Facilities provide for up to £350 million of senior secured borrowings, comprised of a £315 million committed multicurrency revolving credit facility and a £35 million term loan facility. The carrying value of the term loan at 30 June 2020 is £38.1 million which includes £3.1 million indexation. We are currently contemplating a potential amendment and restatement of the Senior Facilities Agreement, which may include a reduction in the commitments under the Revolving Facility to £300 million and an extension of the maturity until 31 January 2025 with a discretionary extension option of 1 year (until 31 January 2026).

The 2025 Notes have a total carrying value of £405.8 million, which is net of unamortised finance costs of £5.5 million. The Group has cross-currency interest rate swaps in place to hedge the sterling cash flows associated with the 2025 Notes. In addition to fixing the sterling value of interest payments over a five-year period, this instrument fixes the sterling repayment of the principal at £367.5 million in 2023, the impact of which, if applied to the borrowings at 30 June 2020, would reduce borrowings by £36.4 million. (5) Represents the £125 million term loan facility. The carrying value of the ESG Facility at 30 June 2020 is £123.0 million, which is net of unamortised finance costs of £2.0 million.

Pursuant to the Term Facilities Agreement, entered into on 18 August 2020, the commitments under Facility F in the amount of €31.5 million will expire after 3 November 2020. Accordingly, on or prior to that date, we expect to submit a request to draw €31.5 million under the Term Loan Facilities, to be funded on or before 13 November 2020, which is the final utilisation date under Facility F.

The effect of excluding certain remeasurements from results of operations is to reflect commodity sales and purchases at contracted prices— i.e., at the all-in-hedged amount paid or received in respect of the delivery of the commodity in question.

74_1,Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.1,Overview,17.1.1,,"We are an innovative electricity generation and supply business in the UK with the goal of enabling a zerocarbon, lower cost energy future. Over the last decade, we have undertaken the largest single site decarbonisation project in Europe as we converted four of the six generation units at Drax Power Station, historically the largest coal-fired power plant in Europe, to run on sustainable biomass, becoming the largest single-site generator of renewable electricity in the UK. We also expanded our business across the value chain through organic growth and complementary acquisitions and now have an integrated utility business model focused on renewable-led, lowcarbon and flexible power generation, the production of sustainable biomass wood pellets and the supply of renewable electricity, gas and other related services to business customers. Our business activities are grouped within three distinct segments: Generation, Pellet Production and Customers. Through our Generation segment, we own and operate a multi-site, multi-technology portfolio of power plants across the UK with a total generation capacity of approximately 6.5GW. We are the UK’s largest renewable generator and the fourth largest electricity generator in the UK based upon anticipated output (as published by the System Operator). We play a significant role in providing reliable, renewable and flexible electricity generation capacity along with increasingly important System Support Services, enhancing the security of the UK’s electricity supply and supporting the UK’s transition to a low-carbon future. Our generation assets include sustainable biomass, pumped storage, hydro and thermal power plants. In 2019, we produced 17.3TWh of electricity, out of which 79.2% came from renewable sources, 16.8% from natural gas and 3.5% from coal. Our generation assets are located across the UK, and we have options to develop further generation capacity in the UK. The multi-site, multi-technology nature of our generation assets and diversified fuel sources allow us to generate flexible and low-carbon electricity and enable us to provide System Support Services to the UK energy system. The System Operator has a growing need for System Support Services and we have a number of contracts in place with the System Operator to supply such services. We own and operate Drax Power Station, which is the largest power plant in the UK by generation capacity with an installed capacity of approximately 4.0GW. Drax Power Station is a critical part of the UK’s energy infrastructure, generating approximately 5 per cent of the UK’s total electricity, and 12 per cent. of the UK’s renewable electricity between January 2018 and December 2019. Based on the 2018-2019 compliance period, Drax Power Station is also the UK’s largest single-site generator of renewable electricity in the UK. Drax Power Station provides flexible and reliable generation and produced 14.0TWh of electricity in 2019, of which 96 per cent. was generated from sustainable biomass, making us a core part of the UK’s decarbonisation strategy. Between 2013 and 2016, we converted three coal-fired generation units at Drax Power Station to biomass-fired generation and in August 2018, we completed the conversion of a fourth coal-fired generation unit at Drax Power Station to biomass-fired generation (at a lower cost than that of converting each of the previous three biomass- fired generation units). Our four biomass-fired generation units receive regulatory support through the index- linked CfD and RO regimes, leading to enhanced earnings streams with a significant component of stable and predictable revenue extending to 2027. Our biomass-fired generation assets are served by an efficient and reliable biomass supply chain comprising dedicated port handling infrastructure and rail paths, thereby enhancing security of supply of fuel for our electricity generation activities. Following a comprehensive review of operations and discussions with National Grid, Ofgem and the Government, we have determined to end commercial coal generation at Drax Power Station in March 2021, with formal closure of coal units to occur in September 2022 at the end of existing Capacity Market obligation ahead of the UK’s 2025 deadline. Our hydropower generation assets include Cruachan pumped storage power plant and hydro power plants at Galloway and Lanark. Cruachan provides over 28 per cent. of the UK’s useable pumped storage capacity and is capable of generating 440MW of large-scale storage and flexible electricity continuously for 16 hours. It also provides contracted System Support Services to the UK electricity system and participates in the Balancing Mechanism, in addition to merchant power generation. In January 2020, Cruachan participated in the stability tender and won a six-year contract which commenced in July 2020 to provide System Support Services to the System Operator, and we are well-positioned to participate in forthcoming auctions for different support service requirements across the UK. The Galloway and Lanark hydro power plants are capable of generating up to a combined 126MW of stable renewable electricity. Lanark (17MW) receives regulatory support from the RO Scheme in respect of its full generation capacity, and Galloway (109MW) receives regulatory support from the RO Scheme with respect to approximately 28MW of its generating capacity, in addition to operating a reservoir and dam system providing power storage capabilities and opportunities for peaking and System Support Services. 89 ----- Our gas-fired generation assets include four CCGT power stations in southern and northern England. Our CCGT power stations at Damhead Creek (805MW), Rye House (715MW), Shoreham (420MW) and Blackburn Mill (60MW) provide baseload and peak power generation, in addition to other System Support Services. We are further responding to the growth in intermittent renewable capacity on the electricity grid by developing a pipeline of flexible generation options, including options to develop up to four 299MW rapid- response standalone OCGT projects and options to repurpose and repower one or both of our remaining coal- fired generation units at Drax Power Station to gas-fired generation. In addition, our Damhead Creek site benefits from an option for the development of a further CCGT asset, Damhead Creek II, which would provide us with an additional 1.8GW of gas generation capacity. We are also exploring an option to expand Cruachan pumped storage plant by up to 0.4GW. Each of these projects has the potential to provide flexible and reliable electricity to the UK electricity system and further diversify our future energy generation capability. However, each project is subject to our long-standing capital allocation policy which seeks to maintain robust financial metrics and a stable net leverage profile and would require an appropriate Capacity Market agreement in future Capacity Market auctions. Through our Pellet Production segment, we produce compressed wood pellets from sustainable sources such as managed forests and sawmill residue in three plants in the US Gulf region. These pellets are used as fuel for our biomass-fired generation in the UK and provided 22 per cent. of our total biomass requirement for the year ended 31 December 2019. The manufacturing process entails purchasing low-grade wood and residues from suppliers local to the manufacturing facilities and transforming them into pellets that can be transported costeffectively to Drax Power Station to generate low-carbon energy. All three of our wood pellet manufacturing facilities are certified under the industry standard Sustainable Biomass Program as producing legally and sustainably sourced biomass. Our wood pellet manufacturing facilities currently have a capacity of 1,475,000 tonnes which we aim to increase to 1,825,000 tonnes by 2021. We are targeting to self-supply five million tonnes of biomass per annum by 2027 as part of our broader initiative to reduce operating costs and expect this increased capacity to deliver returns significantly in excess of the Group’s cost of capital, with strong cash flow generation and fast payback. In furtherance of these objectives, we are investing in three new satellite plants in the US Gulf, which will utilise sawmill residues and leverage our existing US Gulf infrastructure to produce, we believe, biomass at around 20% below the current cost of production. In addition to sustainable biomass pellet plants, we own and operate dedicated port handling infrastructure and rail paths which allows us to achieve economies of scale and reduce the cost and carbon footprint of our operations by allowing us to aggregate small shipments from smaller suppliers into larger shipments, thereby reducing the overall carbon footprint of the relevant shipments. In addition to selfsupply from our manufacturing facilities, we have a network of third party suppliers of sustainable biomass pellets and have a number of long-term contracts with suppliers in North America and Europe to support a long-term, stable supply of biomass. 100 per cent. of the biomass used at Drax Power Station is from sustainable sources (such as sawmill residues, forest thinnings, low value roundwood and branches, but no saw logs are permitted to be used) and the use of SBP certification provides independent assurance that woody biomass is supplied from legal and sustainable sources and that all regulatory requirements in relation to biomass for energy production are met. Our Customers segment, comprising leading challenger brands Haven Power and Opus, is the fifth largest supplier of electricity to businesses in the UK by volume supplied as of 30 April 2020 and the largest provider of renewable energy to businesses. As of 1 October 2020, we supplied over 281,500 electricity and gas meters and, in 2019, we supplied 18.9TWh of electricity and gas. Our Customers segment had an 8 per cent. share of the B2B 90 ----- electricity market by volume of supply in Great Britain as at 30 June 2020 and provides us with a direct route to market for much of the electricity and RoCs we generate and a more diversified counterparty base with less concentrated counterparty credit risk than direct sales by our Generation segment in the wholesale market. We are committed to operating a sustainable business. We are continuing to make progress pioneering world-leading bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (“BECCS”), to deliver negative emissions and help the UK meet its 2050 net zero carbon target. BECCS can play an important role by removing CO2 from the atmosphere and safely storing it, creating negative emissions. The UK’s Committee on Climate Change (“CCC”) has clearly set out what is required for the country to achieve its legally binding objective of being net zero by 2050, including an important role for BECCS. In its response to the CCC report, the UK Government confirmed that there is widespread acceptance that carbon capture and storage has a key role to play in achieving net zero, and announced it is developing a new cross-government Biomass Strategy to assess how biomass should be used across the economy to contribute to the Government’s net zero target. We have identified, track and report on nine non-financial priorities that are material to our business and important to our stakeholders: carbon emissions; environmental impact; sourcing sustainable biomass; healthy forest landscapes; people and culture; health, safety and wellbeing; ethics and integrity and positive social impact. Our strategy is aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals and we have identified SDG numbers 7 (affordable and clean energy), 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), 11 (sustainable cities and communities), 13 (climate action), 15 (life on land) and 17 (partnerships for the goals) where we can have the greatest positive impact. To ensure the biomass we use meets the highest standards, we have set up an Independent Advisory Board (“IAB”) which provides independent advice in all areas of biomass sourcing and performance, and its role in achieving Drax’s ambition of being a carbon negative company. Our efforts have been recognised externally as we are a member of the FTSE4Good Index. In addition, Sustainalytics and MSCI, leading independent providers of environmental, social and corporate governance (“ESG”) research and ratings, have awarded Drax Group PLC an ESG Risk Rating of 25.9 (Medium Risk) and a relative performance ranking of 2nd out of 61 for Independent Power Production and Traders by Subindustry Group and AA respectively.

On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organisation confirmed that its spread and severity had escalated to the point of pandemic. The Covid-19 pandemic, and the governmental and regulatory actions taken to mitigate its effects, has had a significant impact on many aspects of society and the global economy, and the duration and depth of this impact remain uncertain. The Covid-19 pandemic and associated lockdown and social distancing measures have adversely affected workforces, consumer sentiment, economies and financial markets around the world. The Covid-19 pandemic and the measures taken to reduce the spread of the virus have had and are likely to continue to have negative impacts on our business, particularly in our Customers segment, such as a significant reduction in demand from business customers, the increased cost associated with exiting hedged positions due to the drop in market prices, the increase in costs of selling pre-contracted power and gas back into the market, as well as the heightened risk of customer business failure and the increase in bad debt (from £12.5 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to £26.2 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020), principally in the SME businesses we supply. Our Generation and Pellet Production segments were less affected by the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic and associated response measures; in the Generation segment, our contracted positions provided protection from lower demand and the reduction in ROC recycle prices was offset by increased System Support Services, while the Pellet Production segment was not affected as the fibre supply chains have been kept open throughout the pandemic and there was no reduction in demand, given that the segment’s sole customer is Drax Power Station. The increase in System Support Services reflects a reduction in demand for electricity caused by Covid-19, which has meant that the UK electricity system has become increasingly dominated by low marginal cost, intermittent and inflexible generation, such as wind, solar and nuclear, which requires the System Operator to take more actions to balance the system and contract System Support Services from flexible generators like the Group. The Covid-19 pandemic and associated response measures have resulted in an estimated reduction of approximately £44 million on our Group Adjusted EBITDA as of 30 June 2020, and we estimate a potential 2020 full year impact on the Group Adjusted EBITDA of approximately £60 million, which assumes that continued social distancing measures will remain in place throughout 2020 with local measures necessary in highly affected parts of the country. Our full year expectations for capital expenditure have reduced, with a number of projects delayed due to Covid-19. This includes non-essential works at Drax Power Station, and delayed timing of some investments in our biomass supply chain. There remains a range of potential outcomes for the Group’s financial performance in 2020 depending on the depth and duration of the wider economic downturn caused by Covid-19. The health, safety and wellbeing of all employees (all of which were classified as essential workers, both in the UK and in the US, and were thus able to continue carrying on their functions), contractors and visitors remains of paramount importance to us and we are taking all practicable actions to help them, whilst continuing to support the UK’s energy market. In respect of our Generation segment, reflecting its importance as critical national infrastructure, we have focused on being able to operate and generate whilst protecting our employees and contractors, and accordingly this has been, and is expected to continue to be, a matter of priority. Our Customers business has demonstrated that it can still operate effectively through remote working. The Group has adjusted its working practices, implemented new IT infrastructure to support those changes in working practices and tracked business performance. We have not sought any Covid-19-related financial support from any governmental authorities and none of our employees has been furloughed following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. We have modelled both a reasonable worst case and more extreme scenarios to test the Group’s financial resilience and none of the 92 ----- scenarios modelled would result in an impact to the Group’s liquidity, solvency, ratings or covenants that could not be remediated by taking mitigating action. However, it is recognised that Covid-19 continues to carry inherent uncertainties (as would any subsequent outbreak or pandemic) and the impacts continue to evolve, which could lead to further changes in government policy, macroeconomic policy and the behaviours of people and markets that may impact some risks. We continue to assess and monitor these risks and any evolving impact of Covid-19 on our operations and business, including impacts for all our stakeholders. See “Risk Factors—The _coronavirus outbreak and the responses thereto have adversely affected our business, operations and financial results, and the ultimate effects thereof on our business, operations and financial results remain highly uncertain; the emergence of new diseases could materially and adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.”_",N/A,as_expected,2020,654
74_1,Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.2.2,Acquisitions and Pellet Production Investments,"On 31 December 2018, we acquired the DGEL Group, a UK electricity generation business which owns and operates a portfolio of pumped storage, hydro and gas-fired electricity generation assets, including the Cruachan Power Station, one of only four pumped storage assets in the UK, run-of-river assets in Lanark and Galloway and gas-fired CCGT power stations at Damhead Creek, Rye House and Shoreham in the south of England and Blackburn Mill in the North. DGEL also owns SMW Limited, a company operating a biomass-from-waste facility on the outskirts of Glasgow. The assets and liabilities acquired were included in Drax’s consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2018. Due to the timing of the DGEL Acquisition, no income, expenditure or cash flows were included in Drax’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended 31 December 2018 in respect of the DGEL Group. Furthermore, neither the £550 million drawn under the 2018 Bridge Facility after the balance sheet date on 2 January 2019 nor the £141.8 million reduction in cash in respect of the consideration paid (including both the original consideration of £137.0 million and £4.8 million of additional consideration agreed upon in 2019) were reflected in our consolidated net debt as at 31 December 2018, also due to the timing of the payment for the DGEL Acquisition. We incurred integration costs of £nil, £2.7 million and £9.0 million in respect of DGEL for the six months ended 30 June 2020 and 2019 and for the year ended 31 December 2019, respectively. See “Our _Business—Generation—DGEL: General” for more information regarding the DGEL Group._ In April 2017, as part of our strategy to supply Drax Power Station with up to 30 per cent. of its annual demand for wood pellets from our own production, we completed the acquisition of the LaSalle wood pellet facility in Louisiana, which was fully commissioned in the year ended 31 December 2018 and has a nameplate production capacity of 450,000 tonnes. Our Amite, Morehouse and LaSalle facilities produced approximately 753,000 tonnes of pellets in the six months ended 30 June 2020 compared to approximately 646,000 tonnes of pellets in the six months ended 30 June 2019, an increase of 15.4 per cent. period-on-period, and approximately 1,407 kilotonnes (“kt”) of pellets in the year ended 31 December 2019 compared to approximately 1,351 kt of pellets in the year ended 31 December 2018, up 4.1 per cent. year-on-year. In June 2019, we approved an investment of £50.0 million for the expansion of our Morehouse, Amite and LaSalle facilities. Such expansion projects are under way in our Morehouse and LaSalle pellet production facilities, and expansion works are expected to begin in our Amite facility in 2021. Furthermore, on 30 June 2020, we approved a $40 million investment in three new satellite pellet plants in the US Gulf region, which will utilise sawmill residues and leverage our existing infrastructure in order to increase production and reduce pellet costs. We expect the expansion of our existing pellet production facilities and our investment in these three new satellite pellet plans will provide an additional nameplate capacity of approximately 350,000 tonnes per annum and 120,000 tonnes per annum, respectively, by early 2022. In the year ended 31 December 2019, the cost of generation across our portfolio was £73.5 per MWh and, in the long-term, our aim is to reduce the cost of generation from self-supplied biomass to £50 per MWh by 2027.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654
74_1,Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.2.3,Sources of Gross Profit,"_Bark Spread, Clean Spark Spread, Dark Green Spread, Hydro and Pumped Storage_ The core elements to our Generation gross profit are the “bark spread” for electricity generated from biomass, the “clean spark spread” for electricity generated from gas, the “dark green spread” for electricity generated from coal and revenues from our hydro and pumped storage facilities. The “bark spread” is the wholesale electricity price plus renewable support, less the cost of sustainable biomass. The cost of sustainable biomass is the gross cost of purchasing the fuel, which includes the cost of the raw material, processing costs, logistics, handling and storage costs, and is influenced by exchange rates where the fuel is contracted in a foreign currency. The renewable support reflects the value of either the ROCs earned or 93 ----- payments under the CfD Regime through generating electricity from burning sustainable biomass. As a renewable fuel, sustainable biomass is exempt from the EU ETS and Carbon Price Support. The “clean spark spread” is the difference between the wholesale electricity price and the cost of gas and carbon, including emission allowances under the EU ETS and Carbon Price Support and exchange rate differences. The cost of gas and emissions allowances is dependent on market prices at the time the purchases are secured, typically at the same time the power sales take place. The UK’s status as a participant in the EU ETS following Brexit, or any future plan regarding carbon emission allowances or prices, is uncertain after the expiration of the Transition Period. See “—Factors Affecting Gross Margins—Fuel and Carbon Prices”. The “dark green spread” is the difference between the wholesale electricity price and the cost of coal and carbon, including emissions allowances under the EU ETS and the Carbon Price Support and exchange rate differences. The cost of coal and emissions allowances is driven by market prices at the time the purchases are secured. In February 2020, we announced that we expect our coal-fired commercial electricity generation to come to an end in March 2021, following which the “dark green spread” will no longer be a source of gross profit. Historically, revenues from our hydro assets have primarily reflected power sales from levels of electricity generation, which is dependent on rainfall levels and river management and the wholesale electricity price plus renewable support under the ROC Scheme. There is no cost of fuel associated with our hydro assets. The core margin from our Cruachan pumped storage asset was historically the difference between prices achieved through the generation of electricity and the cost of pumping to refill the reservoir at times of low demand. Our hydro assets continue to generate revenues from power sales, although an increasing proportion of their revenues is derived from System Support Services. _Generation Capacity, System Support and the Capacity Market_ With increasing levels of intermittent generation in the industry, we are continuing to identify opportunities to create value from our ability to flexibly operate our generation assets according to prevailing market conditions. This includes short-term power and balancing market activity and the provision of System Support Services on both a short and long-term basis, which are increasingly important for managing the UK electricity system. To capture value in this market, we continue to focus resources on optimising the availability and flexibility of all our generation assets. We compete with other generators for System Support Services contracts. Our margins from System Support Services amounted to £66.1 million, £60.7 million, £120.0 million and £56.9 million for the six months ended 30 June 2020 and 2019 and the years ended 31 December 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in the year ended 31 December 2019 was primarily due to the contribution from the DGEL Assets, which we acquired on 31 December 2018 and were fully consolidated in our results for 2019. The increase in the six months ended 30 June 2020 primarily reflects a period of very high winds in the first quarter of 2020 and the increased need for System Support Services following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in the second quarter, as the reduction in electricity demand has made the UK electricity system increasingly reliant on intermittent and inflexible generation options, such as wind, solar and nuclear power generation, all of which require the System Operator to take more actions to balance the system and contract System Support Services from flexible generators like the Group. Additionally, our Cruachan Power Station was successful in a stability tender for a six-year contract to provide System Support Services to the System Operator, starting in July 2020. We expect the demand for System Support Services to grow as the system decarbonises and becomes increasingly reliant on intermittent inflexible generation. Revenues from short-term power and balancing market activity, the provision of System Support Services and the use of out-of-specification fuels in our coal-fired generation assets are combined into the key performance indicator “value from flexibility”, and are tracked on this basis. In total, our value from flexibility was £66.0 million, £69.0 million, £129.0 million and £79.0 million for the six months ended 30 June 2020 and 2019 and the years ended 31 December 2019 and 2018, respectively. Under a Capacity Market agreement, a generator is entitled to fixed monthly payments in exchange for a commitment to deliver energy during a system stress event, which occurs when the System Operator has to resort to emergency actions in order to balance supply. In November 2018, the General Court of the European Union issued a ruling annulling the European Commission’s 2014 decision to approve the UK Government’s Scheme establishing the Capacity Market and imposed a “standstill period” while the European Commission completed a further “phase two” state aid investigation into the Capacity Market. Payments to generators under existing Capacity Market agreements and the holding of future capacity auctions were suspended as a result. The “phase 94 ----- two” investigation found that state aid was lawfully provided and the Capacity Market was reinstated in October 2019. The net impact of the Capacity Market suspension was a decrease of £6.8 million in our Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended 31 December 2018, which was ultimately recognised in our Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended 31 December 2019. Our revenue from the Capacity Market was £34.0 million for the six months ended 30 June 2020, compared to £nil in the six months ended 30 June 2019 (in 2019, £36.7 million of such income due in respect of the first half of the year was not recognised until the reinstatement of the Capacity Market in October 2019). For the year ended 31 December 2019, our revenue from the Capacity Market was £78.1 million (including £6.8 million related to the period in 2018 subsequent to the Capacity Market suspension), compared to £8.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2018. Prior to the DGEL Acquisition, the DGEL Group received £11.7 million in Capacity Market revenues for the year ended 31 December 2018.

74_1,Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.2.4,Factors Affecting Gross Margins,"_Electricity prices_ The wholesale electricity price is affected by a variety of factors, including the price of underlying commodities such as oil, natural gas and emissions allowances, the availability and type of generating capacity (and, in particular, the level of intermittent generation from sources such as wind and solar compared to baseload generation from gas and nuclear power stations), the level of demand and wider macroeconomic conditions. A power station’s cost of generation is determined largely by the cost of the type of fuel used, which can be susceptible to market forces and vary significantly. Some power producers have negative costs of generation, such as those which generate electricity using wind or solar, as the renewable support provided to these renewable generators exceeds the cost of generation. Power plants can be modelled, according to their different costs of generation, as a stack, which is overlaid with forecasted demand for electricity. The available power producers are drawn on to generate electricity to fulfil this demand, starting with those that have the lowest costs of generation. At the point in the demand stack where forecast demand intersects with available supply, the type of generator supplying electricity at the point of intersection is known as the “marginal plant”. The price at which the marginal power plant is willing to generate therefore dictates the overall market price. Since 2016, we have seen significant volatility in the electricity price. This is largely attributable to fluctuations in the cost of carbon and gas prices. The cost of carbon for fossil fuel generators increased as a result of a significant increase in the price of emissions allowances under the EU ETS, from approximately €4 per tonne of CO2 on certain days in September 2016 to over €25 per tonne of CO2 on certain days in February 2020. Gas prices increased in 2018 following an increase in demand for gas generation due to lower-than-expected liquified natural gas (“LNG”) deliveries, reduced wind throughout the Summer Season and low nuclear output across Europe, and substantially decreased since the beginning of the 2019 Winter Season due to mild weather across the northern hemisphere, high wind generation and increased LNG supplies. Additionally, the high levels of intermittent generation capacity on the system results in thermal generation being displaced in some periods (by generation without a cost of fuel, such as wind generation) but being required in others. As of 22 July 2020, we had contracted fixed price power sales (including both forward sold electricity and gas proxy hedges) of approximately 17.6TWh, 11.4TWh, and 4.8TWh for delivery in 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Average achieved prices for fixed price power sales of forward sold electricity in 2020, 2021 and 2022 were £53.8 per MWh, £49.0 per MWh and £48.2 per MWh, respectively. During periods of low electricity prices, the electricity price that we can achieve in the market may not cover our costs of fuel in our thermal plant and, in the case of generation from coal and gas, the cost of carbon. As a result, it may be more economical for us to idle, or reduce the load factor on, all or some of our generating assets. The continuing increase in generation from intermittent renewables such as wind or solar power, combined with the continuing decrease in available conventional generation capacity due to the retirement of older, less efficient and mostly coal-fired power stations, has resulted in more volatile wholesale electricity prices. This volatility presents an opportunity for generators like the Group that can produce significant amounts of electricity at relatively short notice at times of peak demand, for example, at times of lower production from intermittent renewables due to adverse weather conditions. We expect that the increasing trend of intermittent renewables generation, coupled with a decrease in conventional generation, in particular from coal-fired power stations (given the UK Government’s intention to 95 ----- end electricity generation from unabated coal by 1 October 2024), will continue in the short-to-medium term and will continue to contribute to less liquidity in forward wholesale markets and more volatile wholesale electricity prices in the UK generally. _Fuel and carbon prices_ The spot market prices for wood pellets increased in the year ended 31 December 2018 and reached approximately $200 per tonne of wood pellet in the first quarter of 2019 due to a shortage caused by unseasonal weather, followed by a decrease to approximately $160 per tonne of wood pellet in the last quarter of 2019 and a further decrease to approximately £135 per tonne of wood pellet in the second quarter of 2020, due to the impact of Covid-19 on prices. We were partially protected from these fluctuations in price by our focus on long-term contracts and self-supply. Our average cost of biomass fuel, before the impact of costs of emissions allowances, the Carbon Price Support and ROC support, was approximately £78.2 per MWh in the six months ended 30 June 2020, compared with approximately £74.8 per MWh, £76.3 per MWh and £74.2 per MWh in the six months ended 30 June 2019 and the years ended 31 December 2019 and 2018, respectively. In addition, we have recently engaged in several initiatives aimed at increasing the operational efficiency of our facilities and reducing the cost of our self-supply of sustainable biomass pellets from our Pellet Production segment to our Generation segment. For example, we have entered into a co-location agreement with Hunt Forest Products to develop a sawmill next to our LaSalle site, which commenced production in February 2019 and has provided us greater access to low-cost sawmill residues, lower transportation costs and a reduction in the number of stages in the pellet production process. We also commissioned a new rail spur linking the LaSalle facility to the regional rail network and our port facility at Baton Rouge in May 2019, which also aims at achieving economies of scale and reducing both our costs and carbon footprint. At the port of Baton Rouge, as part of a cooperative endeavour with the port of Greater Baton Rouge and the state of Louisiana, we are commissioning an upgraded chambering yard in 2020 that will allow 80-car train sets to continue to operate from our LaSalle and Morehouse sites, further increasing our economies of scale in rail. These initiatives and others have contributed to a reduction in our biomass cost by $15.6, or 9.2 per cent., from $169.7 per tonne in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to $154.1 per tonne in the six months ended 30 June 2020. In June 2019, we approved an investment of £50.0 million in the expansion of our Morehouse, Amite and LaSalle pellet production facilities. Such expansion projects are under way in our Morehouse and LaSalle pellet production facilities, and expansion works are expected to begin in our Amite facility in 2021. Furthermore, on 30 June 2020, we approved a $40 million investment in three new satellite pellet plants in the US Gulf region, which will utilise sawmill residues and leverage our existing infrastructure in order to increase production and reduce pellet costs. As part of the programme of improvements, efficiencies and investments we have previously identified we believe we will reduce the cost of biomass by £13 per MWh on our existing portfolio by 2022 compared to 2018, assuming a constant exchange rate. In the year ended 31 December 2019, the cost of generation across our portfolio was £73.5 per MWh and, in the long-term, our aim is to reduce the cost of generation from self-supplied biomass to £50 per MWh by 2027, and we continue to progress a number of initiatives in furtherance of this aim. We are generally protected from short-term volatility in foreign exchange rates, due to having an active rolling five-year foreign exchange hedging programme with respect to the currencies in which fuel and carbon prices are denominated (predominantly US dollars, Canadian dollars and euro). Additionally, our focus on long- term contracts and our increasing proportion of self-supply, which enables an ability to adjust production at our selfsupplied biomass facilities to take advantage of attractively priced spot cargoes and provides protection from fluctuations in wider fibre and biomass prices. The cost of carbon in the dark green spread is made up of two elements, the cost of emissions allowances under the EU ETS and Carbon Price Support. The market price of emissions allowances under the EU ETS increased significantly in 2018 and remained higher in 2019 and in the first half of 2020 than in the prior period as a result of the introduction of the Market Stability Reserve in January 2019, aimed at addressing the current surplus of allowances by reducing the supply of allowances to be auctioned, and also due to the future expected value of emissions allowances, which is influenced by political developments. New market entrants and the switching of generation from gas to coal by some generators due to high gas prices also contributed to the increased market price of emissions allowances. The average cost of emissions allowances in support of coal- fired generation was approximately £19.1 per MWh in the six months ended 30 June 2020 compared to approximately £7.8 per MWh in the six months ended 30 June 2019. The Carbon Price Support rate for the first year of operation (2013/2014) was £4.94/tonne, increasing to £9.55/tonne in 2014/2015 and £18.10/tonne in 2015/16; however, the Carbon Price Support price has been capped at £18.00/tonne from 2016 until 2021. In 96 ----- January 2019, the UK Government reaffirmed that the UK will continue to maintain a total carbon price (the combined Carbon Price Support and the EU ETS) until such time as unabated coal-fired generation in the UK has ceased. As a result of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, it is unclear what the UK’s legislative and regulatory framework in relation to carbon emissions and carbon pricing will be following the end of the Transition Period. In particular, the UK’s status as a participant in the EU ETS following the Transition Period is unclear. The UK Government has indicated that it is continuing to develop options for long-term carbon pricing, including establishing a UK ETS (linked to the EU ETS or standalone) or introducing a carbon tax. Previously, in October 2019, the UK Government had published its response to its consultation on the future of carbon pricing and set out its preferred approach, which included securing a linking agreement with the EU for a linked UK ETS.

74_1,Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.2.5,Generation Levels and Availability,"We receive a significant proportion of our revenues from wholesale electricity sales from Drax Power Station, and for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, from wholesale electricity sales from the generation facilities acquired in connection with the DGEL Acquisition. Our revenues are therefore affected by the amount of generation at these facilities, which is in turn underpinned by the availability of these facilities to generate when market conditions dictate that it is economical to do so. Availability of the generating units at our generating assets is impacted by planned maintenance outages, as well as unplanned or forced outages, which are required from time to time to rectify malfunctions or other failures, or other safety-related incidents. Forced outages decrease the amount of electricity that a relevant generation unit is able to generate over a given period, which translates into decreased potential revenue for us. Furthermore, additional costs may be incurred in recovering from any such forced outage, and such costs may be increased by the social distancing measures in place due to Covid-19 to make sure the work is carried out safely. Each of our six generation units at Drax Power Station typically has a planned outage every four years and these outages are usually scheduled for the summer months, when electricity demand and power prices are lower. In the UK power generation industry, the “summer” season comprises the calendar months April to September (the “Summer Season”), and the “winter” season comprises the calendar months October to March (the “Winter Season”). Our maintenance regime for the traditional turbine generator assets at our hydro facilities typically includes annual inspections, minor planned outages every four years and major planned outages every 12 years to complement a routine preventative maintenance regime. We currently plan to undertake a major planned outage on our CfD unit at Drax Power Station (including a high pressure turbine upgrade) and have completed an outage at our Damhead Creek CCGT power station and a number of smaller planned outages across our wider generation fleet in 2020. Reflecting the physical restrictions and the increased costs in carrying out outages as a result of the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic and associated response measures, a planned turbine upgrade at our Shoreham Power Station has been postponed until 2021. We expect that none of these outages will have a notable impact on profitability (excluding operating expenditure) given that generation from our biomass units is commercially constrained by the operation of the ROC cap and the seasonality of the outages, which are concentrated in the Summer Season when electricity demand is lower. We also sometimes experience unplanned outages. The most frequent cause of a forced outage of a thermal generation unit is a boiler tube leak in that generation unit. For example, such leaks have occurred at Drax Power Station approximately 20 times a year over the last five years and ordinarily take two to three days to remedy. However, more severe forced outages can take a longer time to remedy. For instance, in December 2017 a fire on a biomass conveyor between Drax Power Station’s rail unloading facility and its biomass storage domes resulted in an unplanned outage and cessation of generation on two biomass generating units for a period of approximately four weeks. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—We are dependent on continued _output from our facilities and outage at any of our facilities could negatively affect our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations”._ During the six months ended 30 June 2019, we undertook a major planned outage at our fourth biomass unit, followed by a major outage at our second biomass unit in July 2019. We also undertook a planned outage at our Rye House CCGT power station and a minor inspection at our Damhead Creek CCGT power station during the year ended 31 December 2019. We undertook no major planned outages during the six months ended 30 June 2020, which improved our profitability in this period. The biomass availability for the year ended 31 December 2018 was impacted by unplanned outages during the first quarter of 2018 due to a fire in December 2017 in our biomass rail unloading facilities and an unplanned 97 ----- outage at one of our biomass units. Availability for 2018 was also impacted by a planned outage of one coal unit and the conversion of a fourth unit from coal to biomass. During the six months ended 30 June 2019, we also managed lower levels of biomass availability due to high levels of rainfall in the US Gulf, which restricted the level of commercial forest extraction and the availability of low-cost fibre for wood pellet production. The resulting adverse impact of restricted biomass generation in the first half of 2019 was partially offset by optimisation of our biomass generation under the RO Scheme and higher levels of biomass generation in the second half of 2019. During the six months ended 30 June 2020, there have been no significant issues with biomass availability.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654
74_1,Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.2.6,Regulation,"_Renewables_ Revenue from our first, second and fourth biomass-fired generation units at Drax Power Station is supported by the RO Scheme, while the third biomass-fired generation unit is supported by the CfD Regime. Our Galloway and Lanark hydro assets are also supported by the RO Scheme, though the Galloway hydro facility receives ROCs only with respect to approximately 28MW of its 109MW capacity, with the remainder being available for participation in the Capacity Market. The RO Scheme is a market-based mechanism that was introduced in 2002 to support the deployment of large scale renewable energy in the UK. The RO Scheme requires licensed electricity suppliers to submit a specified number of ROCs to Ofgem per MWh of electricity they supply or to make a buy-out payment (which increases annually in line with the UK Retail Price Index). ROCs are issued by Ofgem to accredited renewables generators for each MWh of renewable electricity generated. The number of ROCs received by a generator per MWh of electricity produced differs depending on the type of renewable generation technology utilised. We receive one ROC per MWh of electricity generated from each of our units that is supported by the RO Scheme, though Drax Power Station is subject to an overall station-level ROC cap. This cap is set annually at such a level that the incremental amount of ROCs received by Drax Power Station as a result of the conversion in 2018 of our fourth generation unit to biomass is, and will continue to be, lower than the average number of ROCs we had received in generation from the first two units we converted to biomass under the RO Scheme. Each of our facilities currently supported under the RO Scheme is eligible to receive ROCs until March 2027, at which point we will lose support under this regime. For more information on ROCs, see “Industry _Overview—UK clean energy legislation—Operation of the renewables obligation” and “Risk Factors—Risk Factors Relating to Our Business and Industry—The reduction or abandonment of governmental support for generation of electricity from biomass or other forms of renewable generation or other relevant changes in governmental energy policy may materially adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition and results of operations”._ ROCs are tradable certificates that have no fixed price, so the amount an electricity supplier pays for a ROC is negotiated between the generator and supplier. However, the buy-out payment that a supplier would have to make if it failed to present a sufficient number of ROCs to Ofgem effectively sets a price cap on ROCs and historically the purchase price paid to generators by suppliers has been marginally lower than the buy-out payment. Each ROC is also entitled to a share of the buy-out fund, in which all buy-out payments from suppliers are pooled and then recycled back to suppliers in proportion to the number of ROCs they have validly submitted toward discharging their obligation in the relevant period. Many of our contracts for the sale of ROCs to suppliers contain a provision that requires the supplier to pass the recycle payment received by the supplier following submission of the ROC to Ofgem on to us. The value of ROC generation was negatively impacted by a reduction in ROC recycle in the six months ended 30 June 2020 due to reduced demand during the Covid-19 lockdown. Revenues from the external sale of ROCs amounted to £327.5 million, £309.6 million, £733.7 million and £664.5 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020 and 2019 and the years ended 31 December 2019 and 2018, respectively. External ROC sales increased in the six months ended 30 June 2020 and the year ended 31 December 2019 with respect to the respective prior corresponding periods mainly as a result of actions taken to accelerate the timing of cash flows from ROCs. Where we choose to sell ROCs to accelerate cash flows, we may choose to purchase ROCs at a later date for submission by our Customers segment, ultimately leading to a similar offsetting charge in cost of sales. Our CfD provides a variable top-up to a reference price which reflects average wholesale electricity prices over a certain period. Our CfD was entered into between Drax Power and the Low Carbon Contracts Company Limited, a limited company owned by the UK Government (the “LCCC”), as the CfD counterparty, under which payments are made by reference to a fixed price for each MWh of electricity produced, known as the “strike price”. Our CfD has a term until 2027, at which time biomass generation will cease to be supported under the 98 ----- CfD scheme and, as of 1 April 2020, provided for a strike price of £116.49 per MWh compared to a strike price of £113.65 per MWh as of 1 April 2019. The strike price is adjusted annually on 1 April to reflect consumer price inflation and system balancing costs in the UK. Under the CfD, we sell the electricity in the wholesale market, and when the reference price (which is an average price and therefore not directly related to the price at which we sell the underlying electricity) is below the strike price, we receive a top-up payment from the LCCC for the additional amount we generate and when the reference price is above the strike price, we must pay back the difference it generates to the LCCC. _Generation_ In January 2018, the UK Government reaffirmed its intention to phase out electricity generation from coal by 2025 in order to reduce overall carbon dioxide emissions, and announced the introduction of an emissions intensity limit, which will make generation from unabated coal units uneconomical. More recently, the UK Government announced its intention to bring the deadline for ending unabated coal generation forward to 1 October 2024, although no specific arrangements have been put in place yet. Against the background of these plans, we announced in February 2020 that we expect commercial electricity generation from coal at Drax Power Station to end by March 2021, although our two remaining coal units would remain available to fulfil Capacity Market obligations until September 2022, well ahead of the UK Government’s deadline. Following our decision to end commercial coal generation in March 2021, an impairment review was undertaken for the coal generation assets CGU and we recognised an asset obsolescence charge of £224.2 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020 in respect of the coal generation assets CGU. See “—Depreciation of Coal-Specific Assets”. The IED sets limits on rates of emissions (hourly, daily and monthly) on the amount of NOx, SO2 and particulate matter that we can emit from Drax Power Station and our CCGT power stations. We must ensure that the generation profile of our thermal generation assets operates within such limits. The limits reflect achievable emissions rates from plants such as Drax Power Station and our CCGT power stations, and each of our facilities remains compliant with them. We are focused on meeting the requirements of the Best Available Techniques Reference Document for Large Combustion Plants, published in August 2017 (“BREF”). BREF has reduced air emission limits and further reductions are due mid-2021. The type and quality of fuel used in generation and the load factor of the generation units have an impact on the amount of NOx and other gases released by Drax Power Station and our CCGT power stations. We also have selective non-catalytic reduction technology fitted to five of Drax Power Station’s six generation units which can, at a cost, be turned on to reduce NOx emissions. However, ultimately, if Drax Power Station or one of our CCGT power stations were about to exceed one of the applicable annual limits, we would have to reduce the level of otherwise profitable generation.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654
74_1,Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.2.7,Capital and Operating Expenditure,"Following the UK Government’s consultation to end unabated electricity generation from coal by 2025 (recently brought forward to 1 October 2024), we completed the conversion of a further coal-fired generation unit to biomass in August 2018 at a cost of approximately £29 million (which was lower than the cost of converting each of the previous three biomass-fired generation units as the domes had already been built). In February 2020, we announced that we expect our coal-fired commercial electricity generation to come to an end in March 2021, although our two remaining coal units would remain available to fulfil Capacity Market obligations until September 2022. Accordingly, we have adapted the maintenance and upgrade schedule for our two remaining coal-fired generation units and expect our annual capital expenditure to maintain operational performance with respect to these units to continue to be lower than those seen in past years. We are also working on the expansion of our existing three pellet plants (LaSalle, Morehouse and Amite) by 350,000 tonnes in aggregate over the next two years, amounting to an estimated aggregate investment of £50.0 million. These projects aim to expand total capacity to around 1.85Mt, provide economies of scale and allow greater utilisation of low-cost residues, in order to support our goal of reducing the cost of our sustainable biomass pellets. On 30 June 2020, we approved a $40 million investment in three new satellite pellet plants in the US Gulf region, which will utilise sawmill residues and leverage our existing infrastructure in order to increase production and reduce pellet costs. We expect our investment in these three new satellite pellet plans will provide an additional nameplate capacity of approximately 120,000 tonnes per annum by early 2022. The majority of our recurring capital expenditure is concentrated in the Generation segment. In contrast, the operations of the Pellet Production segment and the Customers segment require relatively small amounts of capital expenditure to maintain operational performance. Within the Generation segment, recurring capital 99 ----- expenditures mainly relate to scheduled maintenance work, periodic replacements and unscheduled repairs. See also “—Depreciation of Coal-Specific Assets” below. See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Capital Expenditure” for a discussion of our expectations relating to future capital expenditure.

The increase in the year ended 31 December 2019 compared to the year ended 31 December 2018 was primarily due to costs associated with our acquisition of the DGEL assets, a planned outage at our Rye House CCGT power station and a minor inspection at our Damhead Creek CCGT power station during 2019, while the decrease in the six months ended 30 June 2020 compared to the six months ended 30 June 2019 was primarily due to the absence of major planned outages and major acquisitions during the six months ended 30 June 2020.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

The market value of our derivative contracts was positively affected by these shifts in exchange rates and we recognised a non-cash, unrealised gain in our income statement, cost of hedging reserve and hedge reserve for the year ended 31 December 2018 as a result of the higher mark-to-market values of these hedging arrangements at year-end relative to the beginning of the year. We are extensively hedged against foreign currency volatility until the end of 2024. Should there be any renewed and prolonged weakness in the pound sterling beyond this period, it may lead to higher fuel prices for us.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

Demand in the UK for electricity and gas is typically higher, and thus drives higher electricity prices and dispatch, in the Winter Season when temperatures are colder. Conversely, demand is typically lower in the Summer Season, when temperatures are higher, thus driving lower electricity prices and dispatch. This trend is experienced by all of our UK-based businesses, as they variously operate within the UK electricity and gas markets, and is most notable within our Generation segment due to its scale and the flexible operation of coal-fired plants when prices are low in the Summer Season. The performance of DGEL’s pumped storage and hydro assets could also be impacted by unseasonal or extreme weather conditions. Our hydro generation facilities are dependent upon hydrological conditions prevailing from time to time in the geographic regions in which our hydro facilities are located. Our Pellet Production segment 100 ----- has a regular production and dispatch schedule, which generally insulates it from demand fluctuations caused by seasonality, although unseasonal weather can reduce the availability of raw materials to produce wood pellets as our fibre suppliers may experience difficulties or may be unable to access harvesting sites. Overall, as a result of these seasonal patterns, profit margins are lower in the Summer Season, partially offset by a related reduction in working capital requirements, with any fluctuations in our cash flow cycle principally managed through cash at hand or borrowings under our debt facilities.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

Following the closure decision, an impairment review was undertaken for the coal generation assets CGU. This review indicated that the recoverable amount of the coal assets, calculated with reference to a value in use calculation based on the Group’s latest approved forecasts, was significantly lower than their carrying value. An asset obsolescence charge of £224.2 million has been recognised in the Drax Group Unaudited Financial Statements as of 30 June 2020 in respect of the coal generation assets CGU. There were no reasonably possible changes in the assumptions underlying the value in use calculation that would have resulted in a material change to the value of the asset obsolescence charge. The asset obsolescence charge has been treated as an exceptional item and excluded from the Group’s Adjusted results. In August 2018, we completed the conversion of our fourth generation unit from coal to biomass at Drax Power Station, leading us to write down £26.8 million of coal-specific assets relating to such unit for the year ended 31 December 2018.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

Industry-specific factors include technology, competition, capacity, government subsidy programmes and supply/demand balance. Factors that specifically impact our operating results include, but are not limited to, acquisitions, plant reliability and efficiency, capital expenditure levels, the ability to benefit from subsidies for the generation of electricity from renewable sources, the ability to receive revenues from the provision of System Support Services (which includes balancing market activities, portfolio optimisation and ancillary services) and the Capacity Market and the extent to which we have hedged our exposure to commodity, foreign exchange and interest rate risks.

The new requirements have impacted the Group’s accounting for lease contracts. The Group’s lease portfolio predominantly relates to properties and the hire of plant and equipment at operating sites. On transition to IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019, assets controlled under lease contracts were brought onto the balance sheet as right-of-use assets, and the Group has recognised a corresponding liability for the amounts payable under its lease contracts. Comparative information for the year ended 31 December 2018 has not been restated. Under the previous accounting standards, operating leases were expensed to the income statement on a systematic basis over the lease term (in the year ended 31 December 2018, £6.3 million was expensed to operating expenses for the operating lease rentals). Under IFRS 16, operating leases are recognised on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets with a corresponding lease liability, resulting in a reduction in operating expenses by £7.4 million in 2019 and an equivalent amount of improved EBITDA in the same year. As at 1 January 2019, right-of-use assets of £37.1 million were recognised and presented separately in the balance sheet (which includes £0.6 million of lease assets recognised previously under finance leases that were reclassified from property, plant and equipment) and additional lease liabilities of £37.6 million were recognised separately on the balance sheet (including £0.5 million previously recognised as finance leases that were reclassified from borrowings).

Following the reinstatement of the Capacity Market in October 2019, we recognised £78.1 million of income from Capacity Market Payments in the year ended 31 December 2019, including £6.8 million of such income relating to the period in 2018 subsequent to the suspension of the Capacity Market. The net impact of the Capacity Market suspension was a decrease of £6.8 million in our Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended 31 December 2018, which was ultimately recognised in our Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended 31 December 2019. Our revenue from the Capacity Market was 101 ----- £34.0 million for the six months ended 30 June 2020, compared to £nil in the six months ended 30 June 2019 (in 2019, £36.7 million of such income due in respect of the first half of the year was not recognised until the reinstatement of the Capacity Market in October 2019).

Revenues from the sale of electricity by the Generation segment are measured based upon metered output delivered at rates specified under contract terms or prevailing market rates, as applicable. ROCs earned from the biomass-fired generation units are initially recognised as a reduction in the Generation segment’s biomass fuel costs and subsequently recognised as revenue when the ROC is sold to a third party. Income or costs arising from the CfD are recognised in the income statement as a component of revenue at the point we meet our performance obligations under the CfD contract. Revenue from the sale of electricity and gas directly to business customers through the Customers segment is recorded after deduction of agreed discounts, VAT and CCL. Revenue is recognised on the supply of electricity or gas when a contract exists, supply has taken place, a quantifiable price has been established or can be determined and the receivables are expected to be recovered at the point of sale. Energy supplied, but not yet measured or billed, is estimated based on consumption statistics and consumption price estimates. Revenue for contracts satisfied over time is recognised in line with the progress of those contracts. The measurement of progress is based on cost inputs for fixed price contracts from the Customers segment, and volume supplied for other contracts. Assumptions are applied consistently but third-party costs can be variable, therefore actual outcomes may vary from initial estimates. Other revenues derived from the provision of services to National Grid (for example, the supply of System Support Services) are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contractual performance obligations. Most such contracts are for the delivery of a service either continually or on an ad hoc basis over a 105 ----- period of time and thus stage of completion is calculated by reference to the amount of the contract term that has elapsed. Depending on the contract terms, this approach may require judgment in extrapolating probable future outcomes. Other revenues derived from the sale of goods (for example, by-products from electricity generation such as ash and gypsum) are recognised at the point the control of goods is transferred to the customer.

In the Generation segment, cost of fuel is the principal driver of cost of sales and represents the cost of purchasing the sustainable biomass that is used to generate electricity in Drax Power Station (net of any ROC support earned) and coal (including the cost of carbon). ROCs earned from the biomass-fired generation units are initially recognised as a reduction in the Generation segment’s biomass fuel costs at the point of generation, and the subsequent revenue is recognised at the time of sale of the ROC. Frequently, the Generation segment also purchases electricity from the market either when it is more economical to do so because the market price for electricity is lower than our marginal cost of production or when delivery obligations cannot be met by our own generation. Grid charges mainly comprise distribution, transmission and system balancing costs. In the Customers segment, cost of sales is mainly driven by electricity purchases. The Customers segment purchases a significant proportion of its electricity requirement from the Generation segment under intra-group electricity purchase agreements. Other costs of sales include third-party costs such as grid charges, the costs of meeting our obligations under the RO and small-scale Feed-in-Tariffs (“SS-FiT”) schemes required to demonstrate the supply of renewable source electricity, CCL-exempt energy to customers. Grid charges reflect costs of distribution, transmission and system balancing costs. In the Pellet Production segment, cost of sales is principally influenced by the price and type of raw fibre used in producing the wood pellets. Our wood pellet manufacturing facilities can process various types of raw fibre from primary sources (such as thinnings, tops and harvesting residues) or secondary sources (such as chips, shavings or sawdust), with secondary sources generally being more cost-effective compared to primary sources. Other costs of sales in the Pellet Production segment comprise costs of transport and other costs related to the production process.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in electricity and gas sales in our Customers segment following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, from £1,125.8 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to £1,031.6 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020, partially offset by £34.0 million in Capacity Market income (compared to £nil in the six months ended 30 June 2019 related to the period in 2019 during which the Capacity Market was suspended) and an increase in our CfD income from £117.0 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to £159.6 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020, primarily due to the increased availability of our CfD unit to 87.8 per cent. over the period, reaching 99.5 per cent. in the three months ended 30 June 2020. Adjusted Revenue (which excludes the impact of certain remeasurements on derivative contracts which are not designated as hedging instruments under IFRS, which resulted in gains of £13.8 million and £5.8 million for the six months ended 30 June 2020 and 2019, respectively) decreased by £21.3 million, or 1.0 per cent., from £2,226.6 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to £2,205.3 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020. _Cost of sales_ Total cost of sales decreased by £157.7 million, or 8.4 per cent., from £1,867.3 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to £1,709.6 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020, primarily due to certain remeasurements on derivative contracts which are not designated as hedging instruments under IFRS, which 108 ----- decreased total cost of sales by £98.9 million (reflecting a remeasurement credit of £94.5 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020 compared to a charge of £4.4 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019), the decrease in the cost of power and gas purchases in our Customers segment from £498.3 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to £435.8 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020 due to the decrease in electricity and gas sales following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, and the mark-to-market losses from exiting hedged positions, also linked to lower demand in our Customer segment following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. The above factors were partially offset by increased fuel costs in our Generation segment (as more biomass was burnt due to the increase in generation output), from £586.8 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to £668.7 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020 and the increase in other costs in our Customers segment from £321.4 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to £336.1 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020. Adjusted Cost of Sales (which excludes the impact of certain remeasurements on derivative contracts which are not designated as hedging instruments under IFRS) decreased by £58.8 million, or 3.2 per cent., from £1,862.9 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to £1,804.1 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020. _Gross profit_ Total gross profit increased by £144.4 million, or 39.6 per cent., from £365.1 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to £509.5 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020, reflecting the movements in revenue and cost of sales, and including a remeasurement credit of £108.3 million on derivative contracts which are not designated as hedging instruments under IFRS, compared to a credit of £1.4 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019. Adjusted Gross Profit, which excludes the impact of certain remeasurements on derivative contracts which are not designated as hedging instruments under IFRS, increased by £37.5 million, or 10.3 per cent., from £363.7 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to £401.2 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020. _Operating and administrative expenses_ Operating and administrative expenses decreased by £17.0 million, or 8.0 per cent., from £213.2 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to £196.2 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020, primarily due to the reduction in repair and maintenance work associated with the absence of any major planned outages in the six months ended 30 June 2020, compared to one major planned outage at our fourth biomass unit carried out in the six months ended 30 June 2019, as well as strategic operating expenditures in the Customers segment in the six months ended 30 June 2019, which did not recur in the six months ended 30 June 2020. _Impairment losses on trade receivables_ Impairment losses on trade receivables increased by £13.7 million, or 109.6 per cent., from £12.5 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to £26.2 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020, reflecting the anticipated impacts of increased business failure and bad debt following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic and associated response measures, resulting in a closing provision, after adjusting for actual credit losses, of £51.6 million at 30 June 2020, compared to £40.7 million at 31 December 2019. The provision is based on a consistent methodology, adjusted to reflect our initial experience and assumptions in respect of cash collections and potential customer business failures in the period since lockdown measures due to the Covid-19 pandemic came into effect in March 2020. _Adjusted EBITDA_ Adjusted EBITDA increased by £40.8 million, or 29.6 per cent., from £138.0 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to £178.8 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020, primarily due to the reinstatement of the Capacity Market in October 2019 (including the recognition of £34.0 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020 compared to £nil in the six months ended 30 June 2019, during which time the Capacity Market was suspended), higher levels of biomass generation, System Support Services and increased pellet production and delivery (from approximately 585,000 tonnes delivered during the six months ended 30 June 2019 to approximately 748,000 tonnes delivered during the six months ended 30 June 2020), largely due to industry-wide challenges with biomass production and supply in the first half of 2019. This increase was partially offset by lower demand and lower prices in our Customers segment following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, which we estimate has resulted in a reduction of £44.0 million in the Group Adjusted EBITDA in the six months ended 30 June 2020. 109 ----- _Depreciation and amortisation_ Depreciation and amortisation charges decreased by £6.9 million, or 6.7 per cent., from £102.6 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to £95.7 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020, mainly reflecting the reduction in depreciation charges following the write-down of the remaining coal assets in February 2020. _Asset obsolescence charges_ In the six months ended 30 June 2020, we incurred £224.2 million of asset obsolescence charges following our decision to cease commercial coal generation at Drax Power Station in March 2021, reflecting the limited residual value of our coal-generating assets following such decision. This charge was recognised as an exceptional item and thus excluded from the Group’s adjusted results for such period. _Acquisition and restructuring costs_ Acquisition and restructuring costs decreased by £2.7 million, or 100.0 per cent., from £2.7 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to £nil in the six months ended 30 June 2020. In the six months ended 30 June 2019, acquisition and restructuring costs reflected the post-acquisition costs of integrating the new assets acquired as part of the DGEL Acquisition into the Group. _Operating profit/(loss)_ Total operating profit decreased by £66.0 million, from a profit of £34.1 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to a loss of £31.9 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020. This increase was primarily due to asset obsolescence charges of £224.2 million in relation to our coal-generating assets, partially offset by the impact of certain remeasurements on derivative contracts (which are not designated as hedging instruments under IFRS), reflecting movements in the mark-to-market position on our portfolio of commodity and financial derivative contracts representing a gain of £108.3 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020, compared to a gain of £1.4 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019. Adjusted operating profit increased by £48.6 million, or 137.3 per cent., from £35.4 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to £84.0 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020, primarily reflecting the increase in Adjusted EBITDA and a reduction in depreciation charges in the three months ended 30 June 2020 following the write-down of the coal assets described above, partially offset by the increase in impairment losses on trade receivables. _Foreign exchange gains_ Foreign exchange gains increased by £0.5 million, from £3.5 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to £4.0 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020. _Interest payable and similar charges_ Total interest payable and similar charges decreased by £1.2 million, or 3.5 per cent., from £34.5 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to £33.3 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020. This was primarily due to the decrease of unwinding of discount on provisions by £3.7 million, partly offset by the increase in amortisation of deferred finance costs by £1.6 million. Adjusted interest payable and similar charges (which excludes the impact of debt restructuring costs associated with the refinancing of the Group’s debt) increased by £1.1 million, or 3.4 per cent., from £32.2 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to £33.3 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020. _Interest receivable_ Interest receivable increased by £0.1 million, from £0.4 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to £0.5 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020. _Tax_ Our total tax credit increased by £4.6 million, from £0.4 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to £5.0 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020. The total tax credit for the six months ended 30 June 2020 is composed of a tax charge of £12.7 million on Adjusted pre-tax profits and a tax credit of £17.7 million in relation to derivative remeasurements and exceptional items. The total tax credit includes a charge of £9.8 million due to revaluation of deferred tax balances following the reversal of the reduction in UK tax rates to 17 per cent. from 110 ----- 1 April 2020, £4.3 million of which relates to coal assets impaired in the period and is therefore included in the exceptional tax charge. The effective tax rate applicable to the Group’s Adjusted pre-tax profits, before taking into account the effect of changes in tax rates, of 13 per cent. is lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK, primarily due to tax relief under the Patent Box Scheme in respect of the use of a patent within our Generation business. The Adjusted Tax Credit/Charge (which excludes the tax impact of exceptional items and certain remeasurements on derivative contracts which are not designated as hedging instruments under IFRS) changed by £13.4 million, from a credit of £0.7 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to a charge of £12.7 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020. The £12.7 million charge in the six months ended 30 June 2020 was primarily due to a significant increase in Adjusted profit before tax from £7.1 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to £55.6 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020. Benefits of £4.0 million and £4.0 million were recognised during the six months ended 30 June 2019 and 2020, respectively, due to tax relief under the Patent Box Scheme, which resulted in a lower effective tax rate than the standard corporation tax rate in the UK. Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) during the six months ended 30 June 2020 were £31.6 million, compared to £7.3 million for the six months ended 30 June 2019, reflecting the one-time impact of the Group falling into the new arrangements in respect of corporation tax payments for very large companies in the UK for the first time, as a result of which the Group must now make tax payments earlier than under the previous regime. _Profit for the year_ Total profit after tax for the year, calculated in accordance with IFRS, decreased by £59.6 million, from a profit of £3.9 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to a loss of £55.7 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020, reflecting the factors discussed above. Excluding the impact of certain remeasurements on derivative contracts and the effect of exceptional items (asset obsolescence charges in the six months ended 30 June 2020; acquisition and restructuring costs and debt restructuring costs in the six months ended 30 June 2019, including, in each case, taxes thereon), Adjusted profit after tax increased by £35.1 million, or 450.0 per cent., from £7.8 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to £42.9 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020.

The effect of excluding certain remeasurements from results of operations is to reflect commodity sales and purchases at contracted prices— i.e., at the all-in-hedged amount paid or received in respect of the delivery of the commodity in question. (2) We define Adjusted EBITDA as profit/loss for the year before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, excluding the impact of exceptional items and certain remeasurements.

This increase was primarily due to £359.1 million of revenue from our new portfolio of pumped storage hydro and gas-fired generation assets integrated into the group as part of the DGEL Acquisition (which includes £46.3 million of Capacity Market income), £31.7 million of Capacity Market income related to Drax Power Station (including £6.8 million of income relating to the period in 2018 subsequent to the suspension of the Capacity Market) and increased ROC sales (£733.7 million in the year ended 31 December 2019 compared to £664.5 million in the year ended 31 December 2018). Overall renewable support under the CfD and ROC regimes in the year ended 31 December 2019 remained broadly in line with the prior period as higher ROC generation and indexation of support payments was offset by a decrease in our CfD income due to an outage over the Summer Season at one of our biomass units at Drax Power Station. Adjusted Revenue (which excludes the impact of certain remeasurements on derivative contracts which are not designated as hedging instruments under IFRS, which resulted in gains of £10.5 million and losses of £8.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2019 and 2018, respectively) increased by £465.6 million, or 11.0 per cent., from £4,237.3 million in the year ended 31 December 2018 to £4,702.9 million in the year ended 31 December 2019. _Cost of sales_ Total cost of sales increased by £389.5 million, or 10.9 per cent., from £3,589.6 million in the year ended 31 December 2018 to £3,979.1 million in the year ended 31 December 2019, primarily due to £191.9 million of cost of sales from the assets integrated into the group following the DGEL Acquisition. Certain remeasurements on derivative contracts which are not designated as hedging instruments under IFRS increased total cost of sales by £190.0 million (which reflects a remeasurement charge of £143.3 million in the year ended 31 December 2019 compared to a credit of £46.7 million in the year ended 31 December 2018). The above factors were partially offset by increased operational efficiencies, mainly at our LaSalle wood pellet facility. Adjusted Cost of Sales (which excludes the impact of certain remeasurements on derivative contracts which are not designated as hedging instruments under IFRS) increased by £199.5 million, or 5.5 per cent., from £3,636.3 million in the year ended 31 December 2018 to £3,835.8 million in the year ended 31 December 2019. _Gross profit_ Total gross profit increased by £94.9 million, or 14.8 per cent., from £639.4 million in the year ended 31 December 2018 to £734.3 million in the year ended 31 December 2019, reflecting movements in revenue and cost of sales and including a £167.2 million gross profit contribution from our new portfolio of pumped storage hydro and gas-fired generation assets integrated into the group as part of the DGEL Acquisition, as well as £132.8 million on derivative contracts which are not designated as hedging instruments under IFRS, compared to a credit of £38.4 million in the year ended 31 December 2018. Adjusted Gross Profit, which excludes the impact of certain remeasurements on derivative contracts which are not designated as hedging instruments under IFRS, increased by £266.1 million, or 44.3 per cent., from £601.0 million in the year ended 31 December 2018 to £867.1 million in the year ended 31 December 2019. _Operating and administrative expenses_ Operating and administrative expenses increased by £119.3 million, or 37.3 per cent., from £320.0 million in the year ended 31 December 2018 to £439.3 million in the year ended 31 December 2019, primarily due to 113 ----- operating and administrative costs of £52.8 million associated with the assets integrated into the Group as part of the DGEL Acquisition, a planned outage at our Rye House CCGT power station and a minor inspection at our Damhead Creek CCGT power station during 2019. In addition, the increase reflects a high volume of repair and maintenance work at Drax Power Station (including two major planned outages at two of our biomass units in 2019), higher costs in the Pellet Production segment associated with increased volumes produced and an increase in central costs (which includes incremental research and innovation costs associated with key strategic initiatives, including BECCS), as well as one-off costs of implementing a new organisational structure to enable us to execute our strategy more effectively. _Impairment losses on financial assets_ Impairment losses on financial assets decreased by £13.4 million, or 42.7 per cent., from £31.4 million in the year ended 31 December 2018 to £18.0 million in the year ended 31 December 2019, reflecting improved cash collection performance in the Customers segment, as well as the impact of a one-off £3.0 million charge in the year ended 31 December 2018 associated with Opus and a one-off £6.1 million benefit in the year ended 31 December 2019 in respect of the resolution of legacy customers’ credit balances and a change to the underlying provisioning methodology. _Adjusted EBITDA_ Adjusted EBITDA increased by £160.2 million, or 64.2 per cent., from £249.6 million in the year ended 31 December 2018 to £409.8 million in the year ended 31 December 2019, primarily due to the new assets integrated into the Group as part of the DGEL Acquisition, the reinstatement of the Capacity Market (including the recognition in the year ended 31 December 2019 of £6.8 million of income related to the period in 2018 during which the Capacity Market was suspended), as well as improved value from flexibility and the increased production at each of our US wood pellet manufacturing facilities, partially offset by lower power sales in our Customers segment, mainly due to a mild 2018/2019 Winter Season resulting in lower coal generation (which had, however, limited margin impact), higher operating expenses in the Customers segment and higher central costs. _Depreciation and amortisation_ Depreciation and amortisation charges increased by £34.1 million, or 19.6 per cent., from £173.8 million in the year ended 31 December 2018 to £207.9 million in the year ended 31 December 2019, mainly reflecting the new generation assets integrated into the group as part of the DGEL Acquisition. _Asset Obsolescence Charges_ In the year ended 31 December 2018, we incurred £26.8 million of asset obsolescence charges in respect of the conversion of the fourth unit at Drax Power Station from coal to biomass. These costs were excluded from the Group’s adjusted results for the year ended 31 December 2018. No similar charges were incurred in the year ended 31 December 2019. _Acquisition and restructuring costs_ Acquisition and restructuring costs decreased by £18.7 million, or 67.5 per cent., from £27.7 million in the year ended 31 December 2018 to £9.0 million in the year ended 31 December 2019. In the year ended 31 December 2018, this category included transaction and integration costs associated with the DGEL Acquisition and restructuring costs in the Customers and Pellet Production segments. In the year ended 31 December 2019, acquisition and restructuring costs reflected the first-year post-acquisition costs of integrating the new assets acquired as part of the DGEL Acquisition into the Group. _Operating profit_ Total operating profit increased by £2.1 million, or 3.5 per cent., from £59.9 million in the year ended 31 December 2018 to £62.0 million in the year ended 31 December 2019. This increase was primarily due to the growth in Adjusted EBITDA described above. In addition, total operating profit includes the impact of certain remeasurements on derivative contracts (which are not designated as hedging instruments under IFRS) and items treated as exceptional in the period. In the year ended 31 December 2019, acquisition and restructuring costs of £9.0 million were treated as exceptional. The impact of certain remeasurements in the year ended 31 December 114 ----- 2019 was a loss of £132.8 million, compared to a gain of £38.4 million in the year ended 31 December 2018. This principally reflected the appreciation of sterling against the US dollar during the year ended 31 December 2019, reducing the value of our forward currency contracts. Adjusted Operating Profit increased by £127.8 million, or 168.2 per cent., from £76.0 million in the year ended 31 December 2018 to £203.8 million in the year ended 31 December 2019, primarily reflecting the increase in Adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by the increase in depreciation and amortisation charges. _Interest payable and similar charges_ Total interest payable and similar charges increased by £18.9 million, or 39.7 per cent., from £47.6 million in the year ended 31 December 2018 to £66.5 million in the year ended 31 December 2019. This increase was primarily due to the issuance of debt to part-fund the DGEL Acquisition. Adjusted Interest payable and similar charges (which excludes the impact of debt restructuring costs associated with the refinancing of the Group’s debt) increased by £20.9 million, or 51.7 per cent., from £40.4 million in the year ended 31 December 2018 to £61.3 million in the year ended 31 December 2019. Costs associated with the restructuring of the Group’s debt was reduced by £2.0 million, from £7.2 million in the year ended 31 December 2018 to £5.2 million in the year ended 31 December 2019. _Foreign exchange gains/(losses)_ Foreign exchange gains and losses increased by £0.1 million from a gain of £0.3 million in the year ended 31 December 2018 to a gain of £0.4 million in the year ended 31 December 2019. _Interest receivable_ Interest receivable increased by £0.1 million from £1.2 million in the year ended 31 December 2018 to £1.3 million in the year ended 31 December 2019. _Tax_ Our total tax credit decreased by £3.1 million, or 48.4 per cent., from a tax credit of £6.4 million in the year ended 31 December 2018 to a tax credit of £3.3 million in the year ended 31 December 2019, primarily as a result of adjustments in respect of prior periods, despite a reduction in total profit before tax. The Adjusted Tax Credit/Charge (which excludes the tax impact of exceptional items and certain remeasurements on derivative contracts which are not designated as hedging instruments under IFRS) changed by £28.9 million, from a credit of £4.8 million in the year ended 31 December 2018 to a charge of £24.1 million in the year ended 31 December 2019. The £24.1 million charge in the year ended 31 December 2019 was primarily due to a significant increase in Adjusted profit before tax from £37.1 million to £142.2 million. Benefits of £8.1 million and £8.0 million were recognised during the years ended 31 December 2018 and 2019, respectively, due to tax relief under the Patent Box Scheme in respect of the use of a patent within our Generation business, which resulted in a lower effective tax rate than the standard corporation tax rate in the UK. Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) during the year ended 31 December 2019 were £9.6 million compared to £1.0 million for the year ended 31 December 2018, which reflects the timing of payments on account. _Profit for the year_ Total profit for the year, calculated in accordance with IFRS, decreased by £19.7 million, or 97.5 per cent., from a profit of £20.2 million in the year ended 31 December 2018 to a profit of £0.5 million in the year ended 31 December 2019, reflecting the factors discussed above. Excluding the impact of certain remeasurements on derivative contracts and the effect of exceptional items (acquisition and restructuring costs, debt restructuring costs and asset obsolescence charges in the year ended 31 December 2018), Adjusted profit after tax increased by £76.2 million, or 181.9 per cent., from £41.9 million in the year ended 31 December 2018 to £118.1 million in the year ended 31 December 2019. 115 ----- Operating Segments The following table shows a breakdown of our gross profit and Adjusted EBITDA by operating segment for the years ended 31 December 2018 and 2019, respectively.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

Adjusted EBITDA for the Generation segment increased by £66.6 million, or 45.1 per cent., from £147.6 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to £214.2 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020. These increases primarily reflect the reinstatement of the Capacity Market in October 2019 (including the recognition of £34.0 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020 compared to £nil in the six months ended 30 June 2019 during which period the Capacity Market was suspended), higher levels of biomass generation (from 6.4 TWh in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to 7.4 TWh in the six months ended 30 June 2020 with CfD income up from £117.0 million to £159.6 million over the same period due to increased availability), as well as increased Systems Support Services income (from £60.7 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to £66.1 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020), as the reduction in electricity demand due to the Covid-19 pandemic has made the UK electricity system increasingly reliant on intermittent and inflexible generation options, such as wind, solar and nuclear power generation, all of which require the System Operator to take more actions to balance the system and contract System Support Services from flexible generators like the Group. These increases were partially offset by increased fuel costs (from £586.8 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to £668.7 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020) and increased grid charges (from £23.1 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to £37.9 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020). _Customers_ Gross profit for the Customers segment decreased by £41.1 million, or 57.5 per cent., from £71.5 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to £30.4 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020. Adjusted EBITDA for the Customers segment decreased by £45.6 million, from £8.8 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to £(36.8) million in the six months ended 30 June 2020. These decreases primarily reflect the impact of the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic and related responses in our Customers business, mainly due to reduced electricity and gas sales (from 9.7 TWh in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to 8.8 TWh in the six months ended 30 June 2020), the increase in costs incurred to exit previously hedged positions by £15.0 million and the increase in expected credit losses on trade receivables (from £12.5 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to £26.2 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020), reflecting the anticipated impacts of increased business failure and bad debt following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. These decreases were partially offset by a decrease in operating costs (from £50.2 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to £41.1 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020). _Pellet Production_ Gross profit for the Pellet Production segment increased by £20.1 million, or 61.1 per cent., from £32.9 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to £53.0 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020. Adjusted EBITDA for the Pellet Production segment increased by £17.2 million, or 226.3 per cent., from £7.6 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to £24.8 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020. These increases primarily reflect the increased output from approximately 646,000 tonnes of wood pellets produced in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to approximately 753,000 tonnes in the six months ended 30 June 2020, reflecting good fibre availability compared to the first six months of 2019 which were adversely impacted by weather, $3.4 million of insurance proceeds received in respect of a business interruption claim due to weather disruptions in the six months ended 30 June 2019, as well as the reduction in the cost of production from $169.7 per tonne of wood pellets in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to $154.1 per tonne of wood pellets in the six months ended 30 June 2020, mainly due to operational efficiencies as a result of our co-location agreement with Hunt Forest Products to develop a sawmill next to our LaSalle site and the new rail spur linking our LaSalle facility to the regional rail network and our port facility at Baton Rouge, as well as the improvement of pellet quality, as measured by the level of fines (larger particle-sized dust) in each cargo, reflecting our focus on incremental improvements to our process. These increases were partially offset by an increase in operating costs, from $32.8 million (£25.4 million applying the average rate for the period) in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to $35.6 million (£28.2 million applying the average rate for the period) in the six months ended 30 June 2020. 112 ----- _Central costs_ Central costs affecting our Adjusted EBITDA decreased by £0.2 million, or 0.8 per cent., from £23.6 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to £23.4 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020. This decrease primarily reflects a reduction in corporate costs, partially offset by an additional £2 million of incremental research and development expenditure associated with key strategic initiatives (including BECCs) during the six months ended 30 June 2020.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

Adjusted EBITDA for the Generation segment increased by £175.1 million, or 75.3 per cent., from £232.4 million in the year ended 31 December 2018 to £407.5 million in the year ended 31 December 2019. These increases primarily reflect the contribution from our new portfolio of pumped storage hydro and gas-fired generation assets integrated into the group as part of the DGEL Acquisition (£167.2 million and £114.4 million to gross profit and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively), increased Capacity Market income for the year ended 31 December 2019 (including the recognition in the year ended 31 December 2019 of £6.8 million of income related to the period in 2018 during which the Capacity Market was suspended), increased ROC generation and improved spreads following efficiency gains from our investments in the performance of our biomass generating units (high pressure turbine upgrade on our second biomass unit in 2018 in addition to other smaller projects) and benefits from our trading position (by buying back power sold in advance at a lower price to make a margin) and portfolio, partially offset by a decrease in our CfD income due to an outage over the Summer Season at one of our biomass units at Drax Power Station. _Customers_ Gross profit for the Customers segment decreased by £9.3 million, or 6.5 per cent., from £143.4 million in the year ended 31 December 2018 to £134.1 million in the year ended 31 December 2019. Adjusted EBITDA for the Customers segment decreased by £10.8 million, or 38.3 per cent., from £28.2 million in the year ended 31 December 2018 to £17.4 million in the year ended 31 December 2019. These decreases primarily reflect lower volumes of power sold (from 20.9 TWh in the year ended 31 December 2018 to 18.9 TWh in the year ended 31 December 2019) primarily due to a mild 2018/2019 Winter Season and incremental restructuring costs, which include an £8.0 million investment to more closely integrate Opus and Haven Power and bring them under one management team and a £7.0 million investment for the development of our next-generation IT systems, partially offset by an improvement in the margin per MWh sold and a reduction in bad debt charges from £31.4 million in the year ended 31 December 2018 to £18.0 million in the year ended 31 December 2019. 116 ----- _Pellet Production_ Gross profit for the Pellet Production segment increased by £19.0 million, or 29.2 per cent., from £65.1 million in the year ended 31 December 2018 to £84.1 million in the year ended 31 December 2019. Adjusted EBITDA for the Pellet Production segment increased by £10.7 million, or 51.4 per cent., from £20.8 million in the year ended 31 December 2018 to £31.5 million in the year ended 31 December 2019. These increases primarily reflect the increased output from approximately 1,351 kt of wood pellets produced in the year ended 31 December 2018 to approximately 1,407 kt in the year ended 31 December 2019 and the reduction in the cost of production from $166.0 per tonne of wood pellets in the year ended 31 December 2018 to $161.0 per tonne of wood pellets in the year ended 31 December 2019, mainly due to operational efficiencies as a result of our co-location agreement with Hunt Forest Products to develop a sawmill next to our LaSalle site and the new rail spur linking our LaSalle facility to the regional rail network and our port facility at Baton Rouge. _Central costs_ Central costs affecting our Adjusted EBITDA increased by £17.7 million, or 62.5 per cent., from £28.3 million in the year ended 31 December 2018 to £46.0 million in the year ended 31 December 2019. This increase primarily reflects incremental research and development expenditure associated with key strategic initiatives (including BECCS), costs associated with implementing a new organisational structure to enable us to execute our strategy more effectively and increased costs associated with delivering working capital initiatives.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654
74_1,Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.36,Liquidity and Capital Resources,17.36.1,,"We are financed through a combination of cash generated from operations and from financing arrangements (which, following the issuance of the Notes and the use of proceeds therefrom as described under “Use of Proceeds”, will consist of the Notes, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes, the 2022 Fixed Rate Notes, the Private Placement Facilities, the Term Facilities, the ESG Facility and the Term Loan). Cash generated from operations is supported by a number of working capital initiatives, including arrangements in respect of payables, receivables, inventories and ROC assets to ensure that the working capital committed is closely aligned with operational requirements. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements”. Liquidity, including short-term working capital requirements, is primarily financed through rebasing and ROC sales. In addition, the Group also has access to the Revolving Facility, which provides for loans of up to £315 million. On 31 December 2018, we acquired DGEL, a UK power generation business which owns and operates a portfolio of hydro, pumped storage and gas-fired power generation assets, for an initial net consideration of £686.9 million after customary net debt and working capital adjustments. We paid the initial consideration due to the vendor on 2 January 2019 using a combination of £550 million drawn under the 2018 Bridge Facility and £136.9 million of cash reserves. Accordingly, no profit or loss was recognised in respect of DGEL in the year ended 31 December 2018, and neither the drawing under the 2018 Bridge Facility nor the reduction in cash in respect of the consideration paid were reflected in our consolidated net debt as at 31 December 2018. The assets and liabilities acquired were included in our consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2018. During the year ended 31 December 2019, we refinanced the 2018 Bridge Facility using the proceeds from the additional 2025 Notes we issued in May 2019 and the Private Placement Facilities in July 2019. Prior to its acquisition by us, DGEL was historically funded by a combination of borrowings from other companies controlled by its former parent, Iberdrola, S.A., and through cash generated from operations.

Net cash generated from operating activities was £167.9 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020 compared to £199.4 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019, primarily as a result of an increase by £24.3 million in cash taxes paid in the six months ended 30 June 2020 reflecting the one-time impact of the Group falling into the new arrangements in respect of corporation tax payments for very large companies in the UK for the first time. Cash generated from operations was £471.2 million in the year ended 31 December 2019 compared to £336.4 million in the year ended 31 December 2018, partially reflecting the increase in Adjusted EBITDA, as well as an increase in the amount of cash released from working capital by making sales to manage our holding of ROC assets and rebasing foreign currency exchange contracts. _Changes in working capital (other than Generation segment carbon assets and ROC assets)_ Our working capital mainly comprises receivables and payables balances. In our Customers segment, working capital mainly comprises trade payables related to the obligation to procure a sufficient number of ROCs and trade receivables against customers. Net cash inflow from changes in working capital (other than Generation segment carbon assets and ROC assets) was £231.3 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020 compared to a net cash inflow of £130.6 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019. Net cash inflow from decreases to inventories was £92.2 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020 compared to net cash inflows from increases in inventories of £65.4 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019. Biomass inventory levels decreased during the six months ended 30 June 2020 due to increased biomass burnt, and increased during the six months ended 30 June 2019 as we stocked up following the biomass supply constraints earlier in the year. Coal inventories decreased during the six months ended 30 June 2020 due to the discontinuation of coal delivery orders following our announcement to end commercial coal generation in March 2021, and increased during the six months ended 30 June 2019 due to a greater proportion of the inventory being held on site, therefore attracting carbon price floor costs and resulting in higher average cost per tonne. Cash released from receivables was £135.1 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020 (six months ended 30 June 2019: £79.6 million), due to the receipt of cash from the Capacity 118 ----- Market for the year ended 31 December 2019. Cash released from payables was £4.0 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020 (six months ended 30 June 2019: £116.4 million), primarily reflecting lower build-up of ROC accruals in the Customers segment due to lower sales in the six months ended 30 June 2020 and an increase in the utilisation of payment facilities in the six months ended 30 June 2019. Net cash outflow from changes in working capital (other than Generation segment carbon assets and ROC assets) was £108.8 million in the year ended 31 December 2019 compared to a net cash inflow of £186.5 million in the year ended 31 December 2018. Net cash inflow from increases to inventories was £67.8 million in the year ended 31 December 2019 compared to a net cash inflow from decreases to inventories of £52.5 million in the year ended 31 December 2018. Biomass inventory levels in the year ended 31 December 2019 were higher than in the year ended 31 December 2018 due to a variety of factors, including phasing of electricity generation. Coal inventories increased in the year ended 31 December 2019 reflecting an increased proportion of total stock held on site, which attracts carbon tax, increasing the carrying amount of stock. Receivables increased by £142.6 million in the year ended 31 December 2019 (year ended 31 December 2018: increase of £15.4 million), driven mainly by the increase of income received in the year ended 31 December 2019 following the reinstatement of the Capacity Market. Payables increased by £101.6 million in the year ended 31 December 2019 (year ended 31 December 2018: increase of £149.4 million). _Increase/decrease in carbon assets_ Carbon assets are emissions allowances purchased and held by us to be used in the relevant year pursuant to EU ETS. Carbon assets remained static in the six months ended 30 June 2020 compared to a decrease of £0.3 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019, and decreased by £4.3 million in the year ended 31 December 2019 compared to an increase of £3.7 million in the year ended 31 December 2018. We purchase carbon assets in advance based on our estimated generation from coal during each year. Increases and decreases in carbon assets therefore mainly reflect lower or higher generation from coal than originally estimated. _Increase/decrease in ROC_ The value of ROCs created in the Generation segment is held on the balance sheet until these assets are sold to a third party, at which time ROCs are recognised as revenue. The timing of such sale is driven by RO deadlines and commercial considerations, resulting in a time lag between the time at which the ROCs are booked in the balance sheet and the time at which the purchase price for these assets is realised. We have facilities in place to accelerate cash flows from invoices issued in relation to ROC sales and also sell ROCs to accelerate cash flows, purchasing ROCs at a later date to meet our regulatory requirements. ROC assets increased by £213.4 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020 compared to an increase of £95.5 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019, principally reflecting an increase in purchases (primarily due to increased sales in the six months ended 31 December 2019) and fewer sales in the six months ended 30 June 2020, as well as the increase in biomass generation. ROC assets decreased by £54.0 million in the year ended 31 December 2019 compared to an increase of £71.2 million in the year ended 31 December 2018, principally reflecting lower generation due to a lower ROC cap and the timing of cash released from working capital by making sales and purchases of ROC assets.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

This increase primarily reflects our investments in the expansion of our US pellet production facilities, along with smaller projects within the Generation segment and a planned CCGT outage at Damhead Creek. Capital expenditure to maintain operational performance constituted £33.0 million and £16.1 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020 and 2019, respectively, which represented 43 per cent. and 28 per cent. of our total capital expenditure for the six months ended 30 June 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment amounted to £151.3 million and £113.6 million in the years ended 31 December 2019 and 2018, respectively. This increase primarily reflects additional expenditure in respect of the new assets integrated into the Group as part of the DGEL Acquisition, strategic projects and investments to advance our objective of increasing self-supply and reducing the cost of pellet production. Capital expenditure to maintain operational performance constituted £59.0 million and £55.0 million in the years ended 31 December 2019 and 2018, respectively, which represented 34.3 per cent. and 38.6 per cent. of our total capital expenditure for the years ended 31 December 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our expected capital expenditures for the remainder of the year ending 31 December 2020 has reduced, as various projects have been delayed following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, including non-essential works at Drax Power Station and initiatives in our biomass supply chain. We expect our capital expenditure for the year ending 31 December 2020 (including the impact of purchases of software assets) to be between £190 million and £210 million, consisting of an estimated £60 million to £70 million of capital expenditure to maintain operational performance, an estimated £30 million in respect of the new assets integrated into the Group as part of the DGEL Acquisition, an estimated £10 million of efficiency and operational improvements, an estimated further £80 million to £90 million for strategic capital expenditure, including a £69.6 million investment in a self-supply project, and an estimated £10 million of other general capital expenditure. In the medium term, we expect to focus our capital expenditure on our upstream pellet supply and on the continuous production of good quality pellets at lower costs. We expect global demand for wood pellets to increase by approximately 60 per cent. over the next five years, inclusive of Drax’s requirements, as other countries develop decarbonisation programmes which acknowledge the benefits of sustainable biomass for generation. Whilst there is an abundance of sustainable biomass globally, there remains limited capacity to convert these fibres into energy dense pellets, which have a low-carbon footprint and lower cost associated with transportation. As a result, we expect the global market for biomass to remain structurally short. We are therefore exploring options to service biomass demand in other markets, including Europe, North America and Asia. In doing so we are creating optionality over our use of sustainable biomass. In June 2019, we approved an investment of £50.0 million for the expansion of our Morehouse, Amite and LaSalle facilities. Such expansion projects are under way in our Morehouse and LaSalle pellet production facilities, and expansion works are expected to begin in our Amite facility in 2021. Furthermore, on 30 June 2020, we approved a $40 million investment in three new satellite pellet plants in the US Gulf region, which will utilise sawmill residues and leverage our existing infrastructure in order to increase production and reduce pellet costs. We expect the expansion of our existing pellet production facilities and our investment in these three new satellite pellet plans will provide an additional nameplate capacity of approximately 350,000 tonnes per annum and 120,000 tonnes per annum, respectively, by early 2022. In the year ended 31 December 2019, the cost of generation across our portfolio was £73.5 per MWh and, in the long-term, our aim is to reduce the cost of generation from self-supplied biomass to £50 per MWh by 2027. We expect to also focus our capital expenditure on the development of our BECCS technical options. On 24 June 2020, we announced that a new BECCS pilot facility will be installed within Drax’s CCUS Incubation Area in the autumn of 2020, when we expect to commence a trial of BECCS technology developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. This project will enhance Drax’s technical understanding for delivering negative emissions and help us drive forward our ambition to become carbon negative by 2030. Subject to the right support from the UK Government, we stand ready to develop and deliver this necessary contribution to the UK achieving net zero emissions by 2050. We are also continuing to develop options for new gas generation which we believe is necessary to provide greater flexibility to the electricity system as it becomes more dependent on intermittent and inflexible 120 ----- generation. As a part of the development options for these projects we are also assessing the potential to introduce hydrogen as part of the fuel mix to further reduce the carbon intensity of these projects. Investment remains subject to an appropriate clearing price in a future Capacity Market auction. Our options range from the development of up to four 299 MW rapid-response OCGT projects requiring £80 million to £90 million spread over three to four years per development, to projects to repower one or both of our coal-fired units at Drax Power Station to 1.8 GW CCGT units (with an initial estimated cost of approximately £600 million per unit, provided in the related planning application for the projects, spread over a number of years), to an opportunity to develop our Damhead Creek II site into a 1.8 GW CCGT plant, with a broadly similar cost to repowering one of our coal units to gas. All projects are in the early stages of development and, accordingly, actual costs may vary. Each of these projects would require an appropriate level of support through the Capacity Market to provide a baseline of expected revenue sufficient to justify a positive investment decision.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

This scheme has been closed to new members as from 1 January 2002. As part of the DGEL Acquisition, employees with defined benefit pension rights who elected to transfer from the ScottishPower pension scheme (the “ScottishPower Pension Scheme”) were transferred to the Group. We have set up a new pension scheme (the “Drax 2019 Scheme”), which took effect on 31 December 2019 (although we had accounted for an estimate of our obligation in respect of the transfer of employees from 31 December 2018, when the DGEL Acquisition took effect) for employees who elected to transfer from the ScottishPower Pension Scheme. The transfer of assets took effect on 19 May 2020, and is currently undergoing its first valuation, expected by the end of 2020. The Drax Power Limited Plan, Haven Power Personal Pension Plan, Opus Energy Group Personal Pension Plan and Drax Biomass Inc. 401(k) Plan are defined contribution schemes, which provide a retirement benefit that is dependent upon actual contributions made by us and members of the scheme. Payments to defined contribution schemes are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered a service that entitles them to the contributions. For the defined benefit pension schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each year. Remeasurement of the obligation, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on scheme assets (excluding interest), is recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit to the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which it occurs. Defined benefit costs, including current service costs, past service costs and gains and losses on curtailments and settlements are recognised within the income statement as part of operating and administrative expenses in the period in which they occur.

(2) On 26 October 2018, the High Court issued a judgment confirming that defined benefit schemes should be amended to equalise benefits in relation to guaranteed minimum pensions for men and women. It is not yet agreed how benefits will be equalised in practice; however, on the grounds that implementation will not lead to any further obligations, our actuarial advisers have initially estimated that the liabilities of the scheme will increase by £0.6 million as at the date of the court ruling. This has been reflected as a past service cost in the year ended 31 December 2018 and had no impact in the year ended 31 December 2019. The last funding valuation of the DPG ESPS was carried out as of 31 March 2019 with a technical funding deficit of £35.9 million.

In determining the rate of growth in dividends from one year to the next, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) will take account of contracted cash flows, the less predictable cash flows from our commodity-based business and future investment opportunities. If there is a build-up of capital, the Board will consider the most appropriate mechanism to return this to shareholders.

Price variations and market cycles have historically influenced our financial results and are expected to continue to do so. We have a policy of securing forward electricity sales, purchases of fuel and CO2 emissions allowances when profitable to do so and in line with specified limits under approved policies. All commitments to sell electricity under fixed price contracts are designated as cash flow hedges as they reduce our cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of electricity. We purchase sustainable biomass, coal and other fuels under either fixed or variable priced contracts with different maturities principally from a number of international sources. We consider all such contracts to be economic hedges. When there is less liquidity in the forward wholesale electricity market, we use gas sales as a proxy for power to mitigate the risk of electricity price fluctuations. We also purchase gas on the wholesale market to meet the demand of our Customers segment’s customers and, following our acquisition of CCGT assets as part of the DGEL Acquisition, as a fuel for our gas-fired generation portfolio. We purchase CO2 emissions allowances under fixed price contracts with different maturity dates from a range of domestic and international sources, in each case through a combination of bilateral trades and through exchanges. All commitments to purchase CO2 emissions allowances under fixed price contracts are designated as cash flow hedges as they reduce our cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of CO2 emissions allowances. We purchase guarantee of origin (“GoO”) certificates from various EU countries. In addition to being used for fuel labelling purposes, GoOs also exempt our Customers segment from financial obligations under various low carbon subsidy schemes, such as SS-FiT and the CfD Regime. These certificates ordinarily cost less than the financial obligations that they offset, creating value and reducing our cost of sales. If commodity prices had been 5.0 per cent. higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, our profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2019 would increase/decrease by £6.8 million (year ended 31 December 2018: profit after tax would increase/decrease by £6.5 million), mainly as a result of our exposure to oil derivatives. If commodity prices had been 5.0 per cent. higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, our hedge reserve at the end of 2019 would increase/decrease by £4.2 million (2018: increase/decrease by £18.9 million), mainly as a result of the changes in the fair value of carbon and electricity derivatives. The sensitivity analysis above has been determined based on the exposure to commodity prices for outstanding monetary items at 31 December 2019 and 2018, respectively.

As of 30 June 2020, we have also taken out a floating-to-fixed swap to fix the interest payments on the £375 million Private Placement Facilities and the £125 million ESG facility.

Foreign currency exchange contracts are entered into to hedge this exposure. As our biomass transformation plans have progressed, we have entered into an increasing volume of foreign exchange contracts. In addition, in order to optimise the cost of funding, we have issued foreign currency-denominated debt in the form of our USD $500 million 2025 fixed rate notes. We utilise derivative contracts to manage exchange risk on foreign currency debt. Our current policy is to hedge material transactional exposures using a variety of derivatives to fix the sterling value of foreign currency cash flows, except where there is an economic hedge inherent in the transaction.

Our Generation and Customers segments are exposed to different levels and concentrations of credit risk, largely reflecting the number, size and nature of their respective customers. Our Pellet Production segment only sells products intra-group. The Customers segment has the most significant credit risk of our operating segments, with a high number of customers of varying sizes operating in a variety of markets. In particular, Opus carries lower concentrations but higher levels of credit risk owing to a customer base comprised largely of smaller retail and commercial entities. Impairment losses on trade receivables in our income statement increased by £13.7 million, or 109.6 per cent., from £12.5 million in the six months ended 30 June 2019 to £26.2 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020 reflecting the anticipated impacts of increased business failure and bad debt resulting from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and associated response measures. In the Customers segment, credit risk is managed by checking a company’s creditworthiness and financial strength both before commencing trade and during the business relationship. Credit risk is monitored and managed by the business sector. In response to the increased risks following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Customers segment has increased minimum credit requirements and excluded a number of identified high-risk business types from its customer acquisition activity in the SME sector. The Customers segment also extended its trade credit insurance programme for large customers in late 2019 to further mitigate its credit risk. In addition, credit risk is transferred on the billed and unbilled receivables monetised through a non-recourse facility which enables the Group to accelerate cash flows associated with trade receivables. For the Generation segment, credit risk arises from treasury, trading and energy procurement activities, as well as through the sale of by-products from generation activities. Wholesale counterparty credit exposures are monitored by individual counterparty and by category of credit rating, and are subject to approved limits. We use master netting agreements to reduce credit risk and net settle payments with counterparties where net settlement provisions exist, allowing us to offset amounts we owe to counterparties by amounts they owe to us. In addition, we employ a variety of other methods to mitigate credit risk, including margining, various forms of parent company guarantee, deed of charge, cash collateral and letters of credit. The majority of the Generation segment’s credit risk is with counterparties in related energy industries or with financial institutions.

We consider the smallest collection of assets that generate independent cash flows to be the two CGUs of Drax Power Station, Haven Power, Drax Biomass, Opus and the OCGTs and accordingly consider the Drax Group to be comprised of six CGUs. The assets of DGEL were recognised on our consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2018 at fair value and are therefore not included in the impairment review at 31 December 2018. In respect of our Generation segment, we consider the smallest collection of assets that generate independent cash flows to be the eight individual sites that share common infrastructure and control functions. In respect of our Customers and Pellet Production segments, we consider the smallest collection of assets that generate independent cash flows to be equivalent to the operating entities within those businesses: Haven Power, Opus and Drax Biomass. If an indication of a potential impairment exists, the recoverable amount of the asset or CGU in question is assessed with reference to the future cash flows expected to be derived from the continuing use of the asset or CGU or the expected price that would be received to sell the asset or CGU to another market participant. If the recoverable amount is less than the current carrying amount within the financial statements, a provision is made to reduce the carrying amount of the asset or CGU to the recoverable amount. The assessment of the present value of future cash flows on which such a review is based is dependent upon a number of assumptions. In particular, expected future cash flows are based upon the reasonable estimates of future prices, output, costs and economic support for renewable energy production by management. In 2015, our market capitalisation fell materially below the carrying value of our net assets. While the shortfall reduced considerably during 2017 and 2018, this remained the case as at 30 June 2020. A review of the Group’s CGUs at 31 December 2019 did not give rise to any indicators of impairment. An impairment review was carried out for those CGUs which have goodwill allocated to them. All impairment reviews conducted for the year ended 31 December 2019 year end indicated adequate headroom to conclude that no impairment charges were required. On 26 February 2020, following a comprehensive review, the Board determined to end commercial coal generation at Drax Power Station in March 2021, with the two coal units remaining available to meet Capacity Market obligations until September 2022. As a result of this closure decision, which reflected that the dependencies between the coal and biomass generating units are no longer considered to be significant, the Group has determined the Drax Power Station site to be comprised of two distinct CGUs, one comprised of biomass generation assets and one comprised of coal generation assets. Previously, the Drax Power Station site was considered to be a single CGU. The 2020 Drax Group Unaudited Financial Statements have been prepared on the basis that this change occurred on the date of the closure decision. 129 ----- Following the closure decision, an impairment review was undertaken for the coal generation assets CGU. This review indicated that the recoverable amount of the coal assets, calculated with reference to a value in use calculation based on the Group’s latest approved forecasts, was significantly lower than their carrying value. An asset obsolescence charge of £224.2 million has been recognised in the 2020 Drax Group Unaudited Financial Statements as of 30 June 2020 in respect of the coal generation assets CGU. There were no reasonably possible changes in the assumptions underlying the value in use calculation that would have resulted in a material change to the value of the asset obsolescence charge.

In the corresponding period, generation from nuclear fuel and renewable sources contributed approximately 17 per cent. and 38 per cent. of electricity generation, respectively. Renewable sources consist of wind and solar (24 per cent. of total generation), bioenergy (11 per cent. of total generation, including biomass) and other renewables (2 per cent. of total generation). The growth of renewable and low-carbon sources led to the achievement of certain milestones during 2019. For example, in 2019 the UK experienced the longest period without energy from coal-fired generation on the grid and during both Q3 2019 and Q1 2020, the UK experienced the first quarters with dominant renewable generation on the grid. 134 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,654
74_1,Offerings 2020.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.2,Overview of the Generation Sector,521.2.2,,"In 2019, approximately 43 per cent. of the electricity produced in the UK was generated by power stations which produce heat by burning fossil fuels such as natural gas (approximately 41 per cent.), coal (approximately 2 per cent.) or oil (less than 1 per cent.). Additionally, 17 per cent. of the electricity produced in the same period in the UK was generated by nuclear power stations and 37 per cent. was generated from a range of renewable energy sources, such as burning biomass, and from water, solar and wind. Pumped-storage facilities provided less than 1 per cent. of electricity in the same period. Incineration of household and industrial waste and burning gases emitted from landfill sites are also used to generate electricity. This diversity of electricity generation is a key contributor to security of supply. Bioenergy 11% Nuclear 17% Pumped storage 1% Hydro Oil Other 2% 0% Coal 2% Wind & Solar 24% Gas 41% _Coal and oil-fired power stations_ Until 1996, coal and oil-fired power stations represented the largest proportion of electricity generation capacity in the UK. Since then, the trend in generation has been the growth of gas-fired and renewable generation and the displacement of coal and oil-fired generation, with the share of generation from gas increasing to approximately 41 per cent. in 2019. In November 2015, the Government announced its intention to phase out electricity generation from coal by 2025 in order to reduce overall CO2 emissions, and has stated that the capacity reduction from the closure of coal plants by 2025 should be replaced by less carbon-intensive energy sources, such as gas. In January 2018, the Government restated its intention and announced the introduction of an emissions intensity limit, which, when enacted, will make generation from unabated coal units uneconomic. In February 2020, the Government stated its 132 ----- intention to bring forward the date for the phasing out of generation from coal to 1 October 2024. In 2018 and 2019, coal plants with an aggregate capacity of 6.5GW were closed in the UK. Three remaining units of the 2GW Fiddlers Ferry coal plant in Cheshire closed on 31 March 2020, with less than 6GW of coal-fired generation capacity remaining in the UK. _Gas-fired stations_ There are two primary types of gas-fired stations: combined cycle gas turbine stations (“CCGT”) and open cycle gas turbine stations (“OCGT”). In an OCGT power station, the hot gases created by natural gas or gas-oil combustion are used to drive a turbine which provides the power to generate electricity. In CCGT power stations, the exhaust from the gas turbine is sent through a boiler to produce steam which is used to drive a steam turbine generator, producing additional electricity from the same fuel. CCGTs are generally fuelled by natural gas, although some stations have the capability to burn gas-oil. Modern OCGT and CCGT plants in the UK are generally capable of varying output upon shorter notice than existing coal-fired units, and hence are more responsive to short-term demand changes. Since 1990, CCGT power stations have provided the vast majority of new thermal generating capacity in the UK due to their greater efficiency compared to OCGT power stations. However, in recent years, the growth in inflexible, intermittent renewable capacity has led to a need for more flexible thermal generation to respond to fluctuations in intermittent output and, accordingly, many new thermal power stations in development are smaller OCGT power stations which are cheaper to build and able to react more quickly to fluctuations in electricity demand. Gas was the dominant fuel type in the UK energy mix in 2019 with over 132TWh of the UK’s total generation of 323.7TWh generated from gas-fired plants, more than the generation from nuclear, solar and wind combined. _Nuclear power stations_ Nuclear power stations in the UK are designed to operate for sustained periods at relatively constant output levels and are not well suited to varying output quickly. Their low variable (as opposed to fixed) costs also mean that they have a commercial incentive to generate as much electricity as possible, and therefore continue to generate electricity during periods when market prices are low. While nuclear power stations accounted for 17 per cent. of the electricity generated in the UK in 2019, a significant number of existing nuclear plants in the UK are due to be retired by the end of the 2020s. _Biomass-fired generation_ Biomass is biological material obtained from living, or recently living, organic matter (such as plants and trees) that can be converted into electricity, fuel and heat. Biomass generation is considered a supply of renewable energy because sourced and burnt biomass can be replaced through re-plantings and the CO2 that is emitted from burning the harvested biomass can be absorbed by the new plant growth through the process of photosynthesis. When biomass is sourced sustainably, the conversion of coal-firing power stations to burning biomass, or co-firing biomass with fossil fuels, can offer a relatively quick, cost-effective way to reduce carbon emissions from electricity generation in the short to medium term. There is a variety of sources of biomass, from forestry residues (branches, tops and other low-grade wood) to dedicated energy crops. Biomass is the fourth largest fuel source in the world after oil, coal and gas. One of the types of sustainable biomass feedstock comes in the form of pellets produced from thinnings, branches, tops and other low-grade wood fibre, together with sawmill chips and sawdust. Co-firing and converted coal plants usually require high-grade ‘clean’ wood pellets, with a high energy density to enhance plant efficiency. A generator’s technical specification for industrial wood pellets is influenced by the combustion technology (the design of boiler, burners and other equipment) and the logistics facilities (transport off/on-site and storage capacity) associated with the plant where it is intended to be used. The combustion technology determines the limitations of tolerable chemical composition and the logistics facilities influence the physical quality requirements. Biomass is the only low-carbon technology capable of providing flexible, reliable electricity and System Support Services at scale, which gives it an advantage over intermittent forms of renewable electricity generation. This form of technology is in the process of being adopted and developed in a number of regions across the world, including Japan, South Korea and Western Europe. 133 ----- _Other renewables_ Apart from biomass, electricity in the UK is generated from other renewable energy sources including wind (both onshore and offshore), solar/photovoltaic, hydro, bioenergy (including landfill gas, sewage sludge digestion, heat pumps and deep geothermal energy) and energy from waste combustion (both household and industrial) technologies. Some of these energy sources, in particular wind and solar, generate electricity only on an intermittent basis and are therefore unable to provide consistent System Support Services. _Energy storage technologies_ Energy storage technologies can be used by generators to provide a flexible, reliable source of electricity supply and to provide System Support Services, including grid balancing services. These features are likely to be increasingly important with the UK energy sector’s move away from baseload generation in favour of flexible, intermittent supply. _Pumped storage_ Pumped storage is currently the dominant method of storing electricity at grid scale, accounting for approximately 95 per cent. of installed storage capacity in the world. It forms part of the UK nationally critical infrastructure and is the only storage technology that forms a notable proportion of the UK’s energy mix. It is the only storage technology that forms a notable proportion of the UK’s energy mix. Pumped-storage sites are based around two reservoirs at different altitudes. Water is released from the upper reservoir to the lower reservoir during periods of high electricity demand with the downflow directed through a turbine which drives a generator to create electricity. The water is then pumped back to the upper reservoir when low-cost, off-peak electric power is available to run the same turbines which also act as pumps. Unlike coal and nuclear stations, pumped-storage stations can generate power in seconds, allowing for quick reactions to variance in grid demand. _Battery storage_ The advancement of battery storage technology has increased rapidly in the last few years. Whilst still a nascent technology at large-scale, it is likely to play an increasingly broad role in the energy markets with a range of applications and has the potential to have a significant impact on the energy sector. On the supply side, large, grid-scale battery storage allows electricity to be generated when it is most efficient and cost effective, stored and then released to the grid during periods of high electricity demand. On the demand side, advances in battery technology may make it increasingly economical for I&C customers (and to a lesser extent, domestic customers) to use storage to reduce their consumption levels at peak demand and to store excess electricity from their own embedded generation.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

74_1,Offerings 2020.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.4,Transmission and Distribution Sector,521.4.1,,"_Overview of the transmission and distribution sector_ The Transmission System carries electricity long distances around the UK at high voltages. It includes the overhead lines, underground cables and substations which connect the large generation assets and interconnectors to the Distribution System. The Transmission Owner owns and operates the Transmission System in Great Britain, and the System Operator co-ordinates and directs electricity flows on to and over the Transmission System, balancing generation supply and user demand. The Distribution System operates at a lower voltage than the Transmission System through networks of overhead lines, underground cables and substations. The Distribution System takes over the role of transporting electricity from the Transmission System and delivers it to customers at a voltage they can use. Whereas large electricity producers are connected directly to the national Transmission System, smaller-scale power stations can be connected directly to the Distribution System on a regional basis. These smaller-scale power stations currently receive various financial benefits (“embedded benefits”) as a result of their direct connection to the Distribution System. In June 2017, Ofgem announced the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority’s decision to reduce these embedded benefits for smaller generators by up to 93 per cent. to prevent market distortion and protect customers. This decision came into force in April 2018. In December 2019, Ofgem completed the Targeted Charging Review into residual network charges and embedded benefits, and proposed changes to certain charges will apply from 2021/22. The Transmission System is linked by interconnectors to the Transmission Systems of France, the Netherlands, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and, following completion of the Nemo Link in January 2019, Belgium. In aggregate, these interconnectors provide an additional 5GW of capacity. Interconnectors connect the UK to other countries’ electricity systems through subsea cables, allowing market participants to trade electricity between the UK and those countries. European legislation requires nearly all interconnection capacity, with some exemptions for long-term interconnection contracts, to be allocated to the wholesale market by way of auction. In May 2014, the Government introduced the “Cap and Floor” regulatory regime to encourage investment in electricity interconnectors. Interconnectors developed under this regime will earn revenue from the allocation of capacity to users who want to flow electricity between the UK and its neighbouring countries. In the scenario where an interconnector does not earn sufficient revenue from its operations, the gap between its revenue and the floor level will be transferred from the System Operator, which will recover the cost through transmission charges to users of the Transmission System. Alternatively, should the interconnector earn in excess of the cap, the surplus will be transferred back to the System Operator. The regime is currently under review by Ofgem to enable project financing arrangements, including the facilitation of private financing. 135 ----- The pilot Cap and Floor project, Nemo Link, a 1GW subsea cable between Herdersbrug on the Belgian coast and Richborough in Kent, UK, became operational in January 2019. The ElecLink interconnector is expected to be operational by the end of 2020 and development of the IFA2 interconnector is expected to commence in early 2022. In 2015, applications for a further five interconnector investment projects were successfully awarded under the Cap and Floor regime (described above), and these projects are expected to become operational between 2020 and 2023. In January 2018, the GridLink, NeuConnect and NorthConnect interconnector projects were granted in principle awards under the Cap and Floor regime and will progress to the final project assessment. Together, these additional projects are expected to add approximately 8.9GW of interconnector capacity in the UK. _System Support Services_ System Support Services, such as balancing, frequency response and reactive power, are used to maintain a reliable system. Contracts for the supply of these System Support Services are offered to electricity generators by the System Operator. Due to the growing dependency on intermittent renewable energy the System Operator has a growing need for system support services. However, as more conventional power stations (typically thermal plant) reach the end of their useful lives, there are fewer market participants capable of providing System Support Services. Together, these factors result in increased system volatility and demand for System Support Services. For example, in June 2017, the System Operator published a report stating that it predicted that within five years over 60 per cent. of settlement periods for electricity may require corrective action to manage grid frequency changes. The System Operator includes the total cost of delivering System Support Services within the Balancing Services Use of System charged to generators and suppliers (“BSUoS”), consisting of the internal and external costs borne by the System Operator in order to balance the system. The evolving mix of generation types contributing to the UK energy system has required the System Operator to procure a wider range of System Support Services to ensure grid stability. Recently, this has involved long-term tenders for non-generative System Support Services and pathfinder schemes which aim to enable a larger share of renewable generation to operate while keeping the grid stable. For example, the System Operator awarded contracts to generators including Drax for the provision of services such as inertia, being the energy stored in spinning plant that slows down the rate at which frequency changes, which therefore enhances the energy network’s resilience to sudden changes on the grid without the need to simultaneously provide electricity. ###### DRAX VALUE FROM FLEXIBILITY[(4) ] (£M) 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 _Overview of the wholesale electricity market_ +25% CAGR 2017 2018 2019 The wholesale market consists of electricity generators producing electricity and selling their output to electricity suppliers who in turn sell electricity to customers. Market participants tend to be focused on either the sale of electricity from generation or the purchase of electricity for supply; however, certain market participants have an interest in both, or alternatively act as intermediaries with no underlying generating assets or supply business. Wholesale trades are entered into through a number of platforms, including brokered platforms, bilaterally or on exchanges. Wholesale trades involve various time frames, from contracts for several years ahead to same-day trading markets and can involve the delivery of electricity for short (half-hours) or long (seasons) fixed periods. 136 ----- The wholesale electricity market trades across three sub-markets: - the long-term forward market, allowing contracts to be struck up to several years ahead of delivery in response to market participants’ requirements; - the short-term market, operated predominantly through electricity exchanges, which gives market participants the opportunity to fine tune their contractual positions; and - the real-time market, through which the System Operator accepts offers and bids for electricity to enable it to balance supply and demand on the system. With the exception of the storage capacity supplied by a limited number of pumped-storage facilities and given the infancy of large-scale battery storage technology, energy cannot be easily stored in large volumes at present. Therefore, to ensure a secure supply of electricity to end users, the volume of generated electricity must match the volume being consumed. The System Operator matches, on a real-time basis, the generation and consumption of electricity in Great Britain to ensure the stability of the electricity system and maintenance of satisfactory voltage and frequency. Where necessary, the System Operator pays sources of generation or consumption to increase or decrease their generation or consumption. Electricity is traded in 30-minute blocks and each generator and supplier, except for certain smaller market participants, has metering that measures or estimates its total generation or aggregate consumption in each 30-minute block. Generators and suppliers, together with other entities, trade voluntarily with each other until the hour before the start of a 30-minute block, which is a point in time referred to as “gate closure”. At gate closure, ideally the volume of electricity that generators have contracted to generate and that suppliers have contracted to consume should be equal, resulting in a balanced electricity system. After gate closure, it is the System Operator’s responsibility to ensure that the electricity system is balanced. Generators and suppliers of electricity are incentivised to contract accurately for the volume of electricity they intend to generate or consume in any 30-minute block. Any imbalance in volume between generators and suppliers results in an “imbalance charge” on the difference between the contractual volume and the metered volume in that 30-minute block. This imbalance charge can be at a less favourable, and less certain, price than the wholesale market price for that particular 30-minute block, which further incentivises generators and suppliers to contract as accurately as possible. Imbalance charges are intended to reflect the costs incurred by the System Operator on behalf of the electricity industry when it has to increase or reduce electricity generation or consumption to balance the electricity system. _Wholesale prices_ The market price for wholesale electricity is affected by a number of factors, including the prices of underlying commodities such as oil, natural gas, coal and biomass; the cost of carbon in the form of emission allowances under the EU ETS and Carbon Price Support; the availability and form of generating capacity on the electricity system; the physical positions taken by individual market participants; and wider economic conditions. A power station needs to achieve enough revenue per MWh to cover its variable costs, including fuel and some variable operation and maintenance costs, to be economically viable to operate in the short term. Electricity prices are set by the intersection of demand and supply, which is demonstrated by the “merit order” principle. The merit order describes the short-run marginal cost of available electricity generation in ascending order for a particular market, against the corresponding amount of energy that will be generated. Power stations available to generate can be modelled, according to their different costs of generation, as a stack, which is overlaid with forecast demand for electricity. The available power stations are drawn on to supply electricity to fulfil this demand, starting with the power stations that have the lowest cost of generation. At the point in the demand stack where forecast demand intersects with available supply, the power station supplying electricity at the point of intersection is known as the “marginal plant”. The marginal price at which the marginal plant is willing to generate therefore dictates the prevailing market price. The fuel type of the marginal plant is the fundamental driver of the market price. A power station’s cost of generation is determined largely by the cost of the type of fuel used, which can be susceptible to market forces and can fluctuate widely. Some power stations have negative costs of generation, such as those which use wind or solar, since the subsidies provided to renewable generators are greater than their minimal cost of generation. A power station’s cost of generation is also affected by its efficiency. Among power stations that depend on the same source of fuel, the range of efficiencies fluctuates depending on a number of factors, including each power station’s technology and level of underlying investment. The cost of generation can therefore vary significantly between plants, despite the same type of fuel being used. 137 ----- In the illustrative example of a demand stack below for Winter 2019, if demand were forecast as 56GW, a coal-fired power station would be the marginal plant and would set the market price. If, however, demand was forecast between 23GW and 52GW, a CCGT power station would be the marginal plant and would set the market price. 60,000 40,000 20,000 HYDRO INTERCONNECTORS  CCGT COAL OCGT PUMPED STORAGE The price for generated electricity can therefore fluctuate in line with the merit order, reflecting different efficiencies, fuel costs and renewable capacity available in the market.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

As of June 2019, there were approximately 28.5 million retail electricity meter points and 23.5 million retail gas meter points in the domestic market and approximately 2.6 million retail electricity meter points and 0.9 million retail gas meter points in the non-domestic market. In the domestic market, contracts for electricity supply are often combined with domestic gas supply in dual fuel contracts. The types of these contracts are varied but tend to be simple rolling tariff or fixed-term contracts, sometimes with an automatic roll over into an open-ended, variable price contract at the end of the fixed term. The non-domestic market can broadly be divided into two sub-sectors: the SME sector comprising smaller companies and micro-enterprises; and the I&C sector. Contract types and pricing structures vary greatly, particularly in the larger I&C market, where contracts are often bespoke. Customers may require that all, or a defined proportion, of the electricity for which they contract is generated from renewable sources. The fungible nature of electricity makes it impossible to trace a particular volume of electricity back to its source of generation, so instead the provenance of the renewable electricity is demonstrated by the supplier acquiring various renewables certificates. The extra cost of renewable electricity is ordinarily passed through to the customer as part of the contract (whether expressly stated or otherwise) and so electricity sold pursuant to these products tends to be more costly than the corresponding volumes of nonrenewable electricity. The extra cost of renewable electricity, however, is also mitigated, and often offset, by various exemptions from charges applied to non-renewable electricity. The increase of small and medium sized entrants in the supply market has led to increased competition; the failure of several suppliers over recent years (including eight suppliers in 2019) has led to Ofgem using its “supplier of last resort” process, under which it chooses a new supplier for customers of a failed supplier in a competitive process, and commencing a review of supplier licencing arrangements, the results of which have not yet been published. Suppliers are starting to offer a wider range of products to customers to reflect the evolution of the I&C and SME markets.

Competition in the supply market increased in stages until it was fully developed by 1999, at which point no geographical franchises remained. 139 ----- Following a period of consolidation among suppliers and generators and, in many cases, subsequent acquisition by large overseas utilities groups, the wholesale market became dominated by the “Big Six” verticallyintegrated energy companies, which owned large market shares in both generation and supply. However, in recent years, the Big Six have lost market share, partly as a result of the entry of challengers into the market. As of April 2020, collectively, the Big Six held around 60 per cent. market share in the large-scale I&C, non-domestic segment compared to 82.4 per cent. in October 2012. In response to their falling market share, the Big Six have, to varying degrees, been changing their business models and reducing their level of vertical integration. For example, E.ON demerged from Uniper in June 2018, following which E.ON and RWE entered into a €43 billion asset swap, which completed in September 2019 and leaves RWE a predominantly renewables- based generator and E.ON a retail and energy services provider. E.ON has announced plans to restructure Npower, an asset it acquired from RWE as part of the asset swap, after plans to merge Npower and SSE failed, thereby removing one of the Big Six from the market. Further, SSE sold its domestic supply business to Ovo Energy in January 2020. To a lesser extent, ScottishPower’s sale of the DGEL Assets to Drax also reflects this reduction of vertical integration and changing business models.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

As additional intermittent renewable generation capacity is commissioned, the market share of such capacity is expected to increase while, at the same time, a substantial proportion of conventional electricity generation comes offline. While some retirements are attributable to the end of operating life, in the case of coal, the prohibitive costs of complying with emissions targets and other environmental regulations have reduced their economic viability. The feasibility of projects has been further affected by the low wholesale price environment that has been experienced in the energy market from 2014 until relatively recently and a Capacity Market structure that has favoured lowest capex and low load factor generation, resulting in no significant new thermal plants successfully clearing the auctions. As an illustration, the system operation National Grid issued an official capacity market notice on 15 September 2020 when its buffer fell below 500MW.

The Government announced that it will bring forward its deadline for ending generation from unabated coal from 2025 to 2024 as part of a drive towards achieving its net zero 2050 target. For example, the Industrial Emissions Directive (“IED”). The IED was enacted to reduce emissions of SO2, oxides of nitrogen and dust from large combustion plants. A number of coal-fired and oil-fired plants that did not comply with the IED’s predecessor, the Large Combustion Plant Directive, were required to close by the end of 2015, driving the need for new generation plants to be commissioned in order to maintain the UK’s security of electricity supply. The Best Available Techniques Reference document for Large Combustion Plants developed under the IED imposes requirements on generators that will further reduce air emission limits when it enters into force no later than mid-2021. 140 ----- DBEIS forecasts that approximately 4GW of existing nuclear power (approximately eight per cent. of peak demand) will be taken out of production by 2024. DBEIS projections also suggest an increase in generation capacity of 32GW from all technologies by 2035 compared to 2017, including an increase in nuclear generation capacity of 5GW. The UK is currently in the process of developing new nuclear capacity with the decision on Hinkley Point C approving what will be the first nuclear power station built in the UK since 1995. Hinkley Point C will have capacity of 3.2GW, with total expected costs of approximately £20 billion with a secured CfD strike price of £92.5/MWh (as of 2012, subject to adjustment for consumer price inflation) for a term of 35 years following the commissioning of each generation unit. However, according to news sources, Hinkley Point C is running significantly over budget and behind schedule (as of September 2019, by £3.4 – 4.4 billion and more than 15 months, respectively). Furthermore, plans to build a nuclear power station at Moorside in Cumbria were halted after NuGeneration Limited, a subsidiary of Toshiba Corporation, announced liquidation in November 2018 and in January 2019, Horizon Nuclear Power Limited, a subsidiary of Hitachi Group, suspended works on its Wylfa Newydd plant.

The Paris Agreement entered into force on 4 November 2016. In August 2017, the US formally notified its intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement effective from November 2020. However, other signatory countries have not followed suit, with many re-affirming their commitments. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has calculated that 70-85 per cent. of global electricity will need to come from renewables by 2050 if the target set out in the Paris Agreement of limiting the worldwide temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels is going to be achieved.

One of the main pieces of legislation supporting renewable generation at the EU level is the Renewable Energy Directive (2009/28/EC) (the “Renewable Energy Directive”). Under the Renewable Energy Directive, EU Member States, and, until at least the end of the Transition Period, the UK, are required to adopt national targets for renewables that are consistent with reaching the European Commission’s overall EU target of a 20 per cent. share of energy from renewable sources relative to final energy consumption from all sources by 2020. In December 2018, the Recast Renewable Energy Directive ((EU) 2018/2001) (“RED II”) came into force, introducing a binding EU-level target for a minimum 32 per cent. share of energy from renewable sources in gross final consumption of energy by 2030.

To meet the UK’s target of 15 per cent. primary consumption from renewable sources, without compromising the security of supply in the system, the UK electricity system may become increasingly reliant upon the construction of new CCGTs and OCGTs, expand in non-intermittent renewable energy (e.g., biomass) and depend on increased imports of electricity through interconnectors. The desire to address climate change, along with supply pressures, has led to a number of regulatory and market initiatives in the UK. In particular, successive Governments have been supportive of the growth of renewable energy, as demonstrated by the legislation passed and policies issued in recent years. _The EU Emissions Trading System_ In 2005, the EU ETS, a cap-and-trade scheme for EU Allowances (“EUAs”) was introduced. The system operates by placing a cap on the total CO2 emissions from industrial sectors and energy-intensive industries which are covered by the scheme. At the end of each year of the scheme, each installation needs to submit a number of EUAs, equal to its CO2 emissions in the period. The scheme is now in its third phase, which runs from 2013 to 2020 (Phase One ran from 2005 to 2007, and Phase Two ran from 2008 to 2012). The fourth phase, which runs from 2021 to 2030, was revised in early 2018 to enable it to achieve the EU’s 2030 emission reduction targets in line with the 2030 climate and energy policy framework. The revision suggests a more aggressive pace of emission cuts, declining the total emission allowances at an annual rate of 2.2 per cent. compared to 1.7 per cent. currently. Additionally, it is proposed to better target carbon leakage rules and encourage low-carbon innovation and modernisation of the energy sector. The eventual application to the UK of this fourth phase is uncertain given the impact of Brexit. The largest sector covered by the EU ETS is the electricity sector. The marginal cost of a thermal non-renewable generator is therefore increased by its cost of purchasing EUAs to cover any carbon emissions over each compliance period. As such, while non-renewable generation is the price-setter, the value of emissions is reflected in the price of wholesale electricity, as adjusted for the carbon intensity of that form of electricity generation. The wholesale electricity price is therefore generally considered to include the cost of carbon emissions, in addition to fuel and other costs incurred by the generator. The ability to trade excess emission allowances is an incentive to companies to reduce overall emissions by investing in more efficient technology or shifting to less carbon-intensive energy sources, in return for receiving additional revenue. Consequently, the carbon price fluctuates based on the supply and demand of emission allowances. Historically, in depressed economic conditions, the market was oversupplied with unused emission allowances, trading at a significantly lower price, and thereby minimising any disincentive for the energy market to generate electricity from more carbon-intensive coal-fired plants. The market price of emissions allowances increased significantly in 2018 relative to 2017 in anticipation of the introduction of the Market Stability Reserve in January 2019 which aimed to address the current surplus of allowances by reducing the supply of allowances to be auctioned. New market entrants and the switching of generation from gas to coal by some generators due to high gas prices also contributed to the increased market price of emissions allowances. The details of the UK’s future legislative and regulatory framework in relation to carbon emissions and carbon pricing is currently unclear as a result of Brexit. In particular, the UK’s status as a participant in the EU ETS following the Transition Period is unclear, as is the timing of any potential introduction of a UK carbon emissions tax. The Government has indicated that it is continuing to develop options for long-term carbon pricing, including remaining in the EU ETS, establishing a UK version of the emissions trading system (linked to the EU ETS or standalone) or a carbon tax.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

The CCA also established the Committee on Climate Change (“CCC”), which advises the Government and devolved administrations on progress towards this target. The CCC’s advice to the Government on carbon budgets and targets is presented to the UK Parliament by the Government with the ultimate aim of enacting the advice into law. The CCA requires the Government to set legally binding carbon budgets (a cap on the amount of GHG emitted in the UK over a five-year period). The CCA commits the UK to a 100 per cent. reduction in net GHG emissions by 2025 (taking into account the effect of carbon trading), relative to 1990 levels (“net zero”). To achieve net zero, any emissions will need to be balanced by schemes to offset an equivalent amount of GHGs from the atmosphere. The UK Treasury has started a net zero review to analyse options and assess how the UK can maximise economic growth opportunities during the transformation, including how to reduce emissions without exporting them elsewhere. GHGs can be prevented from being emitted or in some cases removed from the atmosphere by making use of innovative technologies such as BECCS or else by afforestation and reforestation. The CCC estimates that in 2050, approximately 175 million tonnes of CO2e will likely need to be removed annually to offset GHG emissions. In the electricity generation sector, 35 million tonnes are estimated to come from BECCS (5GW of capacity delivering 41TWh of biomass generation) and 57 million tonnes from CCS on plant fuelled by nonbioenergy sources. The international, supranational and national commitments described above are enshrined in law and underpin the UK’s efforts to mitigate climate change through the deployment of renewable energy. To facilitate investment in renewable energy and hence meet these legal commitments, the Government has developed support regimes which sit within and alongside the UK electricity market. _The Renewables Obligation_ The RO Scheme is a market-based mechanism which has been the main source of financial support from the Government to large-scale renewable electricity generation in the UK since 2002. The powers required to establish the RO were included in the Utilities Act 2000, and the detailed mechanics are defined in Renewables Obligation Orders, which are implemented periodically and the most recent of which came into force in July 2018. As a result of the transition to the CfD Regime under the Electricity Market Reform, the Renewables Obligation Closure Order came into force on 9 September 2014, which has closed the RO to new generation capacity that seeks to be accredited on or after 1 April 2017. As of 1 April 2017, existing projects already accredited under the RO Scheme (including all biomass units at Drax Power Station other than the unit benefitting from the CfD, our Lanark hydro plant and approximately 28MW of capacity at our Galloway hydro plant) are expected to remain under the RO Scheme for the remainder of their period of support until at least 2027, unless they shift to the CfD Regime instead. The transaction from the RO Scheme to the CfD regime can be effected through an application process with Ofgem. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and _Industry—The reduction or abandonment of governmental support for generation of electricity from biomass or other relevant changes in governmental energy policy may materially adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition and results of operations”. Operation of the renewables obligation_ The RO Scheme operates in England and Wales, with parallel obligations in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The RO Scheme places an obligation on licensed electricity suppliers either to source a proportion of the electricity they provide to customers from eligible renewable sources or to make a buy-out payment. The sourcing of renewable energy is demonstrated by the supplier presenting ROCs (equivalent in number to the supplier’s individual obligation) to the administrator of the RO Scheme, Ofgem. 143 ----- ROCs are issued by Ofgem to renewable generators for each MWh of renewable electricity generated in different proportions based on the type of technology used. Electricity suppliers can source ROCs from renewable electricity generators. ROCs are tradable commodities that have no fixed price and therefore the amount an electricity supplier pays for a ROC is a matter for negotiation between the supplier and generator. If a supplier fails to purchase sufficient ROCs to fulfil its obligation to source renewable electricity, then it must make a buy-out payment for each of the ROCs it should otherwise have submitted. Buy-out payments are in turn recycled back to the suppliers in proportion to the amount of ROCs submitted by those suppliers. As such, the price of ROCs is inversely related to the amount of renewable energy produced: the greater the shortfall below the target, the greater the buy-out payments to those who did submit ROCs. DBEIS sets the level of the obligation to source renewable electricity each year using a headroom calculation. The headroom calculation provides a set margin between the predicted generation (supply of ROCs) and the level of the obligation (demand for ROCs). This helps reduce the possibility of supply exceeding the obligation in any given year and therefore the market value of a ROC being diminished. See “Risk Factors— _Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Fluctuations in the demand for and supply of ROCs could result in the revenues we receive from the sale of ROCs to third party suppliers being substantially lower than anticipated”._ The RO Scheme provides for the price of buy-out payments to increase with the retail price index each year, beginning at £30/MWh in 2002 and now at £48.78/MWh for the compliance period ending on 31 March 2020. Each RO Scheme compliance period begins on 1 April and lasts one year. Suppliers must comply with their obligation by submitting ROCs for that compliance period (or ROCs for the immediately preceding compliance period that were not previously submitted) by the September following the end of the compliance period. Ofgem then collects all the buy-out payments and makes the payment to suppliers approximately one month later. If Ofgem experiences a shortfall in the value of buy-out payments received in excess of £15.4 million during any given compliance period due to supplier failure then a mutualisation process is initiated whereby the remaining suppliers are collectively obligated to make up the shortfall. There is a delay of approximately three months between the generation of a unit of renewable electricity and the accreditation of the associated ROC in Ofgem’s Renewables and Combined Heat and Power Register. After this accreditation, the ROC can be transferred. From the generator’s perspective, the revenue received for each unit of electricity sold under the RO Scheme comprises three main elements, which together constitute the RO Scheme all-in price. Each of these three elements has an independent value and can be sold separately. The three elements are: - the revenue realised in the wholesale electricity market: the market price of electricity generated; - _the revenue realised for selling the ROC: a fixed amount paid by a supplier for the ROC in question (traditionally a percentage of the buy-out payment avoided by the supplier as a result of having acquired the ROC instead); and - the revenue realised from recycling: a share of the buy-out fund which is recycled back to suppliers and then typically passed on to generators under the terms of the sale of ROCs. The price realised for each of these elements must be bilaterally negotiated between the relevant generator and its counterparty, or counterparties, in the market. Historically, the price of ROCs has been similar to, and followed the price of, buy-out payments. _Grandfathering of support under the Renewables Obligation_ A banding system was introduced to regulate the RO Scheme in April 2009. This system provides that the numbers of ROCs received by a generator per MWh of electricity produced differs depending on the type of renewable generation technology deployed, the principle being that less developed technologies should receive a greater number of ROCs to encourage their development. However, to mitigate the disturbance that could arise from banding (and changing ROC awards for projects already in operation or under construction), the banding levels for most technologies are grandfathered. Grandfathering is a Government policy that allows, once a generating station is accredited and receiving support under the RO Scheme, the level of support received to remain unchanged for the lifetime of its support. Grandfathering gives generators sufficient certainty of income to make investment in new renewable generation capacity. The latest comprehensive banding review occurred in 2012 and provided a level of 1.0 ROC for every MWh of renewable generation from converted biomass units and 0.9 ROC for every MWh of renewable generation 144 ----- from high-range, or enhanced, co-firing units. Enhanced co-firing units are defined as units co-firing at least 85 per cent. biomass with fossil fuels such as coal. In April 2013, grandfathering was extended to the biomass conversion and mid-range co-firing bands and also to the high-range co-firing band in April 2014. For these bands, grandfathering operates so that, once the generating station has been accredited under the RO Scheme, grandfathering applies to the level of support at the date that the combustion unit moves into the mid-range, highrange or biomass conversion band. Grandfathering then applies for so long as the combustion unit stays in that band and ceases to apply as soon as the combustion unit moves into another band. A combustion unit is treated as moving into a new band from the moment it starts generating electricity in respect of which ROCs under that new band are issued. However, since 12 December 2014, new biomass conversion units and combustion units already receiving support under the RO Scheme that move for the first time into the mid-range co-firing, high-range co-firing or biomass conversion bands, will no longer be covered by the Government’s grandfathering policy. The RO Scheme closed to newly accredited renewable generation on 1 April 2017, following which generators are not able to apply for support under the RO Scheme in respect of any new renewable generation unless they were considered eligible to apply for certain grace periods, all of which have now ended. All renewable generation plants which have been accredited before this time are able to continue to receive ROCs based on their grandfathered bands (if grandfathered) and the headroom principle continues to apply. In July 2018, the Renewables Obligation (Amendment) Order 2018 came into force, establishing an annual cap of ROCs received at the power station level for biomass-fired generation facilities. For each power station with existing grandfathered units, the cap is equal to (i) the forecast level of ROCs to be generated from existing grandfathered units (such forecast to be determined by DBEIS in line with its RO headroom calculation detailed above); plus (ii) a unit allowance of 125,000 ROCs per annum per non-grandfathered unit. If and to the extent that a power station receives fewer ROCs from its grandfathered units than DBEIS forecast for the relevant year, then this shortfall in ROCs may instead be issued with respect to biomass-fired generation from the non-grandfathered units in excess of the 125,000 ROCs per annum allowance. Our fourth unit at Drax Power Station was converted to biomass after the announcement and is not grandfathered, but operates under the ROC regime. The station level ROC cap allows generators to flex generation between grandfathered and non-grandfathered units within the confines of the overall power station cap, thereby reducing the impact that unplanned outages may have on their ability to generate renewable electricity and receive ROCs. See “Our _Business—Our History—Transition to Net Zero”._ From 1 April 2027 to 31 March 2037, the current buy-out fund system is no longer intended to be in effect, and all accredited projects that are still receiving ROCs at that time (for many projects, these are scheduled to end in 2027) are expected to simply receive a fixed payment of 110 per cent. of the buy-out price for their ROCs from a central body. This procedure is still being finalised. The 2027 buy-out price will be fixed at this point but will continue to be indexed to the retail price index throughout the remaining ten years of the RO. _Climate Change Levy_ The Climate Change Levy (“CCL”) is a tax on energy (electricity, gas, solid fuels) being supplied to non-domestic customers in the UK, introduced in 2001. Non-domestic customers—to which the CCL applies— are in the following sectors: industry, commerce, agriculture or public services. The objective of the CCL is to create an incentive for efficiency in energy usage and reduce CO2 emissions. In its initial form, the CCL exempted electricity generated from renewable and approved combined heat and electricity schemes. This exemption was, however, removed from the regime in 2015. _Carbon Price Floor_ The Carbon Price Floor was designed to incentivise investment in low-carbon electricity generation by providing greater support and certainty to the carbon price in the UK’s electricity generation sector. It was introduced in response to fluctuations in the price of carbon (in the form of EU ETS allowances) which resulted in uncertainty for investors in low-carbon technologies. With effect from April 2013, the UK implemented a system of Carbon Price Support which is intended to give investors long-term visibility of a rising carbon price in the UK, which will be reflected in the future price of UK electricity. The Carbon Price Support had an original starting level of £4.94/tonne of CO2 for 2013/14. It was originally expected that the Carbon Price Support level would rise to £30/tonne of CO2 by 2020; however, it is currently capped at £18/tonne of CO2 until it is uprated with inflation in 2020/2021. In January 2019, the Government reaffirmed that the UK will maintain a total carbon price (the combination of the Carbon Price Support and the EU ETS) at around the current level until unabated electricity generation from coal has ended. The UK’s status as a participant in the EU ETS at the end of the Transition Period remains unclear. 145 ----- _Small-Scale Feed-in Tariffs_ The SS-FiT scheme is a Government programme designed to promote the uptake of a range of small-scale renewable and low-carbon electricity generation technologies and is available through licensed electricity suppliers. The SS-FiT scheme requires tariff payments on both generation and supply of renewable and low-carbon electricity to be made by certain suppliers. Tariff payment rates are index-linked and therefore increase or decrease with inflation. On 18 December 2018, the Government declared that the scheme would be closed to new applications beginning 1 April 2019.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654
74_1,Offerings 2020.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.15,Overview of Electricity Market Reform,521.15.1,,"The Electricity Market Reform package was announced in 2010 and has been implemented steadily over time. Electricity Market Reform was designed to decarbonise electricity generation in the UK, secure the UK’s energy supply in a capacity-constrained market place and minimise the cost of electricity to customers. The four main components of the Electricity Market Reform package were: - the Carbon Price Support: the implemented tax upon fossil fuels used to generate electricity, set at a price per tonne (see “—UK clean energy legislation—Carbon Price Floor”); - CfDs: long-term contracts to support investment in new renewable energy projects; - the Capacity Market: this involves the award of Capacity Market agreements to generators which receive payments in return for committing to generate at times of system stress; it also aims to encourage investment in demand-side response capacity; and - the Emissions Performance Standard (“EPS”): this will cap the amount of carbon emissions that a new fossil fuel generation plant can emit. The budget for low-carbon electricity investment across the various support schemes was originally controlled by a Government framework, the Levy Control Framework. However, in Autumn 2017, the Government announced a new Control for Low Carbon Levies, which replaced the existing Levy Control Framework. The LCL Control covers all existing and new low-carbon electricity levies, including the RO Scheme, the CfD Regime and SSFiT and affirms the current subsidy support for existing projects, but based on the current projection of levy spend on such low carbon schemes, it is anticipated that there will be no new low carbon electricity levies until 2025. Calls for evidence for a review of the Capacity Market and EPS components of the Electricity Market Reform package (discussed below) were issued in 2018 and the Government’s review, which was published in July 2019, concluded that the rules and objectives of the Capacity Market scheme continue to be appropriate. The Government is continuing to consult on proposals to implement commitments made during the European Commission’s Capacity Market decision and certain other design improvements. _Contracts for Difference_ CfDs were introduced to provide efficient and long-term support for low-carbon generation, and to increase revenue certainty for generators. A CfD provides a variable top-up to the wholesale electricity price that a generator can theoretically achieve by selling its electricity in the wholesale market. The CfD is entered into between a renewable electricity generator and the Low Carbon Contracts Company Limited, a limited company owned by the Government (the “LCCC”), as CfD counterparty, under which payments are made by reference to a fixed price for each MWh of electricity produced by the generator, known as the strike price. The generator sells the electricity in the wholesale market outside the CfD. When a specified market reference wholesale electricity price (which, for a baseload generator is calculated as the average market wholesale electricity price based on seasonahead prices) is: - below the strike price, if the generator generates, the generator receives a top-up payment from the LCCC for the difference between the market reference wholesale electricity price and the strike price; - above the strike price, if the generator generates, the generator must pay back to the LCCC the difference between the market reference wholesale electricity price and the strike price. Strike prices under a CfD are indexed for inflation (UK CPI). The LCCC is funded by electricity suppliers, which pass the cost on to customers. As a result, the generator has stability in respect of the price of the electricity that it generates from renewable sources for the term of the CfD, normally expected to be 15 years. The Government intends that the stabilisation of revenue under CfDs will increase the rate of investment and lower the cost of capital, thereby reducing costs to customers. 146 ----- CfDs are awarded through “allocation rounds”, each of which has a pre-determined budget for CfDs divided into three “pots”, one each for established technologies, less-established technologies and biomass conversions, respectively. The first allocation round of CfDs concluded in February 2015 and resulted in the procurement of 2.1GW of capacity at an annual cost of £315 million. The second allocation round of CfDs (Pot 2) concluded in September 2017 and resulted in 3.3GW of capacity at an annual cost of £176 million. Biomass conversion projects were not eligible to bid in the second allocation round of CfDs. The third allocation round of CfDs concluded in May 2019 and resulted in 5.8GW of capacity at strike prices that were broadly comparable to the prevailing market price and therefore minimal subsidy cost. As in the second allocation round, biomass conversion projects were not eligible to bid. _Investment contracts_ To bridge the temporal gap between the RO Scheme and the awarding of CfDs under the CfD Regime, the Government decided to issue an early form of CfDs called Investment Contracts pursuant to the FIDeR regime in advance of the full implementation of the CfD Regime. Investment Contracts were introduced to avoid any major hiatus in investment during the changes to the market under the Electricity Market Reform ahead of implementation of CfDs. Investment Contracts were awarded if the Government considered that, without the Investment Contract, there was a significant risk that the electricity generation to which that Investment Contract relates would not occur or would be significantly delayed. In April 2014, DECC announced that eight renewable electricity projects received Investment Contracts, with strike prices based on December 2013 strike prices. _Capacity Market_ The Capacity Market is designed to help address concerns about the future security of electricity supply. In Capacity Market auctions, participants bid for Capacity Market agreements under which they commit to generate at times of system stress. Under a Capacity Market agreement, a generator is entitled to fixed monthly payments which provide guaranteed revenue for the investors of generation plants. Generators are, however, subject to penalties if they do not deliver energy during a system stress event, which occurs when the System Operator has to resort to emergency actions in order to balance supply. A forecast of future demand is made four years in advance. The net capacity required to meet a Government-set reliability standard will then be procured through a Capacity Market auction. Generation units which benefit from a CfD or an Investment Contract or which receive support under the RO Scheme are not eligible to participate in the Capacity Market at the same time. Consequently, our biomass units and Lanark run hydro facility and approximately 28MW of capacity at our Galloway hydro facility are not eligible for the Capacity Market, but the rest of our CCGT, Cruachan pumped storage and hydro power plants, as well as our two remaining coal-fired units at Drax Power Station participate in the Capacity Market up to the most recent auctions in January 2020 and March 2020. Capacity Market auctions are run under a descending clock format, starting with offers of £75/kW and gradually reducing until the minimum price is reached at which the supply of capacity offered by bidders is equal to the volume required. Capacity Market agreements at the clearing price are offered to those generators and demand-side responders that were successful in the auction. The length of agreement can vary depending on the nature of the project, with new plants being entitled to long-term agreements (15 years), to encourage investment in new generation assets; refurbished plants being offered three-year agreements; and existing generators and demand-side responders being offered one-year contracts. During the delivery year, capacity providers will receive monthly payments for their agreed obligation at the auction clearing price. Providers are expected to be available to respond with their agreed generation volumes or to reduce their demand when called on by the System Operator at times of system stress. The Government has acknowledged with respect to previous T-4 Capacity Market Auctions that clearing prices were not sufficient to incentivise new electricity generating capacity to be built, in particular the inability to secure proposals of new, large-scale, lower emission gas generation. In response, the Government has proposed to introduce several changes to the Capacity Market. To reduce “speculative bids”, in 2016 the Government doubled the level of credit cover per MW each bidder must have in place for the capacity it proposes, and raised termination fees for plants that wished to exit the Capacity Market mechanism prior to the end of its existing Capacity Market agreements. Furthermore, the System Operator revised upward its demand target for the upcoming auctions, leading to the market anticipating higher capacity payments outturn. The T-4 Capacity Market Auction in December 2016 secured 52.4GW of capacity for delivery in 20202021, at a clearing price of £22.50/kW (in 2015/2016 prices). The first Capacity Market agreements awarded in a 147 ----- T-4 Capacity Market Auction had been intended to begin in Winter 2018/19, but, citing a need for additional security of supply in Winter 2017/18, the System Operator held a T-1 Capacity Market Auction earlier than scheduled in January 2017 with the stated aim of procuring capacity for the immediately following winter. This auction secured 54.4GW of capacity for delivery at a clearing price of £6.95/kW (kilowatt). The T-1 Capacity Market Auction, which concluded in February 2018, secured a further 5.78GW of capacity for delivery in Winter 2018/19 at a clearing price of £6.00/kW. The T-4 Capacity Market Auction in February 2018 for delivery in 2021/2022 secured 50.4GW at a clearing price of £8.40/kW (in 2016/2017 prices). The T-1 Capacity Market Auction in June 2019 for delivery in winter 2019/20 secured 3.63GW of capacity at a clearing price of £0.77/kW. The T-1 Capacity Market Auction in February 2019 for delivery in winter 2020/21 secured 1GW of capacity at a clearing price of £1.00/kW. The T-3 Capacity Market Auction in January 2020 for delivery in winter 2022/23 secured 45.1GW of capacity at a clearing price of £6.44/kW. The T-4 Capacity Market Auction in March 2020 for delivery in winter 2023/24 secured 43.7GW of capacity at a clearing price of £15.97/kW. On 15 November 2018, the General Court of the European Union issued a ruling annulling the European Commission’s 2014 decision not to undertake a more detailed investigation of the Government’s scheme establishing the Capacity Market (the “Capacity Market Ruling”). The Capacity Market Ruling imposed a “standstill period” while the European Commission completed a further “phase two” state aid investigation into the Capacity Market. The European Commission concluded its “phase two” investigation in October 2019 and reapproved the Capacity Market scheme. This ruling cleared the way for re-instating the scheme with a T-3 Capacity Market Auction for delivery in 2022/2023 held in January 2020, which secured 45.1GW at a clearing price of £6.44/kW (in 2017/2018 prices) and another for delivery in 2023/2024 held in March 2020, which secured 43.7GW at a clearing price of £15.97/kW (in 2018/2019 prices). Following the European Commission’s reapproval and the reinstatement of the Capacity Market, payments to generators, including retrospective payments made for capacity provided, recommenced. Whilst the Capacity Market has been reinstated without any fundamental changes, it is possible that further challenges may be brought in the future and any resulting reduction or abandonment of governmental support for generation of electricity from biomass or other forms of renewable generation or other relevant changes in governmental energy policy may materially adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition and results of operations..

The EPS will effectively ensure that no new coal-fired power stations may be developed, unless equipped with carbon capture and storage (“CCS”) technology. CCS technology enables CO2 emissions from industrial plants to be captured and stored permanently deep underground, thereby removing carbon emissions created by power stations from the atmosphere. The operator of any new fossil fuel plant at or over 50MW will have a total tonnage allowance of CO2 within which it must ensure that emissions from the plant remain. The EPS has initially been set at an annual limit equivalent to 450g of CO2 per kWh for a baseload (continuously operating) generating plant. The limit is intended to be reviewed every three years, but plants operating at that point will remain subject to that standard until 2045. 148 ----- The Energy Act 2013 and the Emissions Performance Standard Regulations 2015 also set out detailed circumstances in which the EPS may be modified or suspended in order to maintain the UK’s security of supply, and provide powers for an appropriate national authority to establish a monitoring and enforcement regime. 149 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,654
74_1,Offerings 2020.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.19,OUR BUSINESS Overview,521.19.1,,"We are an innovative electricity generation and supply business in the UK with the goal of enabling a zero-carbon, lower cost energy future. Over the last decade, we undertook the largest single site decarbonisation project in Europe as we converted four of the six generation units at Drax Power Station, historically the largest coal-fired power plant in Europe, to run on sustainable biomass, becoming the largest single-site generator of renewable electricity in the UK. We also expanded our business across the value chain through organic growth and complementary acquisitions and now have an integrated utility business model focused on renewable-led, lowcarbon and flexible power generation, the production of sustainable biomass wood pellets and the supply of renewable electricity, gas and other related services to business customers. Our business activities are grouped within three distinct segments: Generation, Pellet Production and Customers. Through our Generation segment, we own and operate a multi-site, multi-technology portfolio of power plants across the UK with a total generation capacity of approximately 6.5GW. We are the UK’s largest renewable generator and the fourth largest electricity generator in the UK based upon anticipated output (as published by the System Operator). We play a significant role in providing reliable, renewable and flexible electricity generation capacity along with increasingly important System Support Services, enhancing the security of the UK’s electricity supply and supporting the UK’s transition to a low-carbon future. Our generation assets include sustainable biomass, pumped storage, hydro and thermal power plants. In 2019, we produced 17.3TWh of electricity, out of which 79.2% came from renewable sources, 16.8% from natural gas and 3.5% from coal. Our generation assets are located across the UK, and we have options to develop further generation capacity in the UK. The multi-site, multi-technology nature of our generation assets and diversified fuel sources allow us to generate flexible and low-carbon electricity and enable us to provide System Support Services to the UK energy system. The System Operator has a growing need for System Support Services and we have a number of contracts in place with the System Operator to supply such services. We own and operate Drax Power Station, which is the largest power plant in the UK by generation capacity with an installed capacity of approximately 4.0GW. Drax Power Station is a critical part of the UK’s energy infrastructure, generating approximately 5 per cent of the UK’s total electricity, and 12 per cent. of the UK’s renewable electricity between January 2018 and December 2019. Based on the 2018-2019 compliance period, Drax Power Station is also the UK’s largest single-site generator of renewable electricity in the UK. Drax Power Station provides flexible and reliable generation and produced 14.0TWh of electricity in 2019, of which 96 per cent. was generated from sustainable biomass, making us a core part of the UK’s decarbonisation strategy. Between 2013 and 2016, we converted three coal-fired generation units at Drax Power Station to biomass-fired generation and in August 2018, we completed the conversion of a fourth coal-fired generation unit at Drax Power Station to biomass-fired generation (at a lower cost than that of converting each of the previous three biomass- fired generation units). Our four biomass-fired generation units receive regulatory support through the index- linked CfD and RO regimes, leading to enhanced earnings streams with a significant component of stable and predictable revenue extending to 2027. Our biomass-fired generation assets are served by an efficient and reliable biomass supply chain comprising dedicated port handling infrastructure and rail paths, thereby enhancing security of supply of fuel for our electricity generation activities. Following a comprehensive review of operations and discussions with National Grid, Ofgem and the Government, we have determined to end commercial coal generation at Drax Power Station in March 2021, with formal closure of coal units to occur in September 2022 at the end of existing Capacity Market obligation ahead of the UK’s 2025 deadline. Our hydropower generation assets include Cruachan pumped storage power plant and hydro power plants at Galloway and Lanark. Cruachan provides over 28 per cent. of the UK’s useable pumped storage capacity and is capable of generating 440MW of large-scale storage and flexible electricity continuously for 16 hours. It also provides contracted System Support Services to the UK electricity system and participates in the Balancing Mechanism, in addition to merchant power generation. In January 2020, Cruachan participated in the stability tender and won a six-year contract which commenced in July 2020 to provide System Support Services to the System Operator, and we are well-positioned to participate in forthcoming auctions for different support service requirements across the UK. The Galloway and Lanark hydro power plants are capable of generating up to a combined 126MW of stable renewable electricity. Lanark (17MW) receives regulatory support from the RO Scheme in respect of its full generation capacity, and Galloway (109MW) receives regulatory support from the RO Scheme with respect to approximately 28MW of its generating capacity, in addition to operating a reservoir and dam system providing power storage capabilities and opportunities for peaking and System Support Services. 150 ----- Our gas-fired generation assets include four CCGT power stations in southern and northern England. Our CCGT power stations at Damhead Creek (805MW), Rye House (715MW), Shoreham (420MW) and Blackburn Mill (60MW) provide baseload and peak power generation, in addition to other System Support Services. We are further responding to the growth in intermittent renewable capacity on the electricity grid by developing a pipeline of flexible generation options, including options to develop up to four 299MW rapid- response standalone OCGT projects and options to repurpose and repower one or both of our remaining coal- fired generation units at Drax Power Station to gas-fired generation. In addition, our Damhead Creek site benefits from an option for the development of a further CCGT asset, Damhead Creek II, which would provide us with an additional 1.8GW of gas generation capacity. We are also exploring an option to expand Cruachan pumped storage plant by up to 0.4GW. Each of these projects has the potential to provide flexible and reliable electricity to the UK electricity system and further diversify our future energy generation capability. However, each project is subject to our long-standing capital allocation policy which seeks to maintain robust financial metrics and a stable net leverage profile and would require an appropriate Capacity Market agreement in future Capacity Market auctions. Through our Pellet Production segment, we produce compressed wood pellets from sustainable sources such as managed forests and sawmill residue in three plants in the US Gulf region. These pellets are used as fuel for our biomass-fired generation in the UK and provided 22 per cent. of our total biomass requirement for the year ended 31 December 2019. The manufacturing process entails purchasing low-grade wood and residues from suppliers local to the manufacturing facilities and transforming them into pellets that can be transported costeffectively to Drax Power Station to generate low-carbon energy. All three of our wood pellet manufacturing facilities are certified under the industry standard Sustainable Biomass Program as producing legally and sustainably sourced biomass. Our wood pellet manufacturing facilities currently have a capacity of 1,475,000 tonnes which we aim to increase to 1,825,000 tonnes by 2021. We are targeting to self-supply five million tonnes of biomass per annum by 2027 as part of our broader initiative to reduce operating costs and expect this increased capacity to deliver returns significantly in excess of the Group’s cost of capital, with strong cash flow generation and fast payback. In furtherance of these objectives, we are investing in three new satellite plants in the US Gulf, which will utilise sawmill residues and leverage our existing US Gulf infrastructure to produce, we believe, biomass at around 20% below the current cost of production. In addition to sustainable biomass pellet plants, we own and operate dedicated port handling infrastructure and rail paths which allows us to achieve economies of scale and reduce the cost and carbon footprint of our operations by allowing us to aggregate small shipments from smaller suppliers into larger shipments, thereby reducing the overall carbon footprint of the relevant shipments. In addition to selfsupply from our manufacturing facilities, we have a network of third party suppliers of sustainable biomass pellets and have a number of long-term contracts with suppliers in North America and Europe to support a long-term, stable supply of biomass. 100 per cent. of the biomass used at Drax Power Station is from sustainable sources (such as sawmill residues, forest thinnings, low value roundwood and branches, but no sawlogs are permitted to be used) and the use of SBP certification provides independent assurance that woody biomass is supplied from legal and sustainable sources and that all regulatory requirements in relation to biomass for energy production are met. Our Customers segment, comprising leading challenger brands Haven Power and Opus, is the fifth largest supplier of electricity to businesses in the UK by volume supplied as of 30 April 2020 and the largest provider of renewable energy to businesses. As of 1 October 2020, we supplied over 281,500 electricity and gas meters and, 151 ----- in 2019, we supplied 18.9TWh of electricity and gas. Our Customers segment had an 8 per cent. share of the B2B electricity market by volume of supply in Great Britain as at 30 June 2020 and provides us with a direct route to market for much of the electricity and RoCs we generate and a more diversified counterparty base with less concentrated counterparty credit risk than direct sales by our Generation segment in the wholesale market. We are committed to operating a sustainable business. We are continuing to make progress pioneering world-leading bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (“BECCS”), to deliver negative emissions and help the UK meet its 2050 net zero carbon target. BECCS can play an important role by removing CO2 from the atmosphere and safely storing it, creating negative emissions. The UK’s Committee on Climate Change (“CCC”) has clearly set out what is required for the country to achieve its legally binding objective of being net zero by 2050, including an important role for BECCS. In its response to the CCC report, the UK Government confirmed that there is widespread acceptance that carbon capture and storage has a key role to play in achieving net zero, and announced it is developing a new cross-government Biomass Strategy to assess how biomass should be used across the economy to contribute to the Government’s net zero target. We have identified, track and report on nine non-financial priorities that are material to our business and important to our stakeholders: carbon emissions; environmental impact; sourcing sustainable biomass; healthy forest landscapes; people and culture; health, safety and wellbeing; ethics and integrity and positive social impact. Our strategy is aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals and we have identified SDG numbers 7 (affordable and clean energy), 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), 11 (sustainable cities and communities), 13 (climate action), 15 (life on land) and 17 (partnerships for the goals) where we can have the greatest positive impact. To ensure the biomass we use meets the highest standards, we have set up an Independent Advisory Board (“IAB”) which provides independent advice in all areas of biomass sourcing and performance, and its role in acheiving Drax’s ambitino of being a carbon negative company. Our efforts have been recognised externally as we are a member of the FTSE4Good Index. In addition, Sustainalytics and MSCI, leading independent providers of environmental, social and corporate governance (“ESG”) research and ratings, have awarded Drax Group PLC an ESG Risk Rating of 25.9 (Medium Risk) and a relative performance ranking of 2nd out of 61 for Independent Power Production and Traders by Subindustry Group and AA respectively.

74_1,Offerings 2020.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.20,Our History,521.20.2,Transition Towards Net Zero,"_Transitioning from coal to sustainable biomass at Drax Power Station_ In 2013, at Drax Power Station we commenced a programme of converting coal generation assets to sustainable biomass. Prior to this Drax Power Station was fuelled exclusively by coal. The first of Drax Power Station’s six generation units was converted to run on sustainable biomass in April 2013 with support under the RO Scheme. The second unit was fully converted to run on sustainable biomass in October 2014, also with support under the RO Scheme. A third unit was fully converted to run on sustainable biomass on 21 December 2016 under the CfD Regime after the European Commission granted state aid approval of our CfD for this unit conversion. In August 2018, we completed the conversion of a fourth coal-fired generation unit at Drax Power Station to biomass-fired generation under the RO Scheme at a cost of £30 million (which was lower than the cost of converting each of the previous three biomass-fired generation units as the domes had already been built). We expect to end commercial coal generation in March 2021, with the formal closure of the remaining coal units due to take place in September 2022. We receive one ROC per MWh of electricity generated from those units that are supported by the RO Scheme. In July 2018, the Renewables Obligation (Amendment) Order 2018 came into force, establishing an 153 ----- annual ROC cap at the power station level across all RO accredited biomass-fired generation units equal to DBEIS’s estimate of the number of ROCs to be received by each grandfathered biomass-fired unit (the first and second converted units at Drax Power Station) plus 125,000 ROCs for each non-grandfathered unit (the fourth converted unit at Drax Power Station). Though we may not always reach the annual station-level ROC cap, the conversion of this fourth generation unit to biomass gives us the flexibility to optimise our generation across all RO-accredited units at Drax Power Station in a way that maximises the number of ROCs we receive within the aggregate cap providing valuable operating redundancy. For example, if output from either of the first two converted units at Drax Power Station were to be lower than DBEIS’s estimated output (for example, due to an outage, any issues with the biomass supply chain or market conditions), we could increase electricity generation under the fourth converted unit in excess of 125,000MWh to make up for such shortfall. In 2019, we were able to partially offset lower levels of biomass availability in the first fiscal quarter by optimizing generation at higher levels in the fourth fiscal quarter, delivering a record level of monthly renewable generation in December 2019. Our third converted biomass-fired generation unit benefits from the CfD Regime, under which payments are made to us, or we make payments, by reference to a fixed price for each MWh of electricity produced, known as the strike price. As a result, we have certainty in respect of the price of the electricity that we generate from that unit for the term of the CfD. For further information on the RO Scheme and the CfD Regime, see “Industry Overview—UK Clean Energy Legislation—The _Renewables Obligation” and “Industry Overview—Overview of Electricity Market Reform—Contracts for Difference”._ In April 2018, we joined the Powering Past Coal Alliance to support the Government in promoting reduced coal use globally. The Powering Past Coal Alliance is a UK-Canadian initiative which seeks to end the use of coal by 2030 in developed countries. _Integration and development of other non-coal generating assets_ Since 2016, we have diversified our portfolio of generation assets, expanded our generation capacity and transitioned into a multi-site, multi-technology operator of dispatchable flexible generation assets that can support the decarbonisation of the UK energy system and the growth of intermittent renewable energy. In December 2018, we acquired ScottishPower’s 2.6GW portfolio of pumped storage, hydro and gas-fired generation assets located across Scotland, Northern England and Southern England. The acquisition of these generation assets has further extended and broadened our generation capacity and capability, expanding our flexible, low-carbon and renewable generation model and increasing our ability to provide System Support Services to the UK energy system. Our Cruachan pumped storage power plant and CCGT power stations increased our ability to provide more of the flexibility increasingly required by the UK energy system to enable higher levels of intermittent renewable generation while delivering higher-quality contract-based revenues, and accelerated our development from a single-site generation business into a diversified national power generator. _BECCS and carbon negative generation_ In December 2019, we announced an ambition to become carbon negative by 2030. We are developing options to use bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (“BECCS”) technology to safely capture carbon dioxide emitted from our biomass generation units at Drax Power Station, transporting the captured carbon dioxide to storage sites under the North Sea, delivering negative emissions. Our BECCS ambition aligns with the UK Government’s target to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and the advice of its statutory advisory body, the Committee on Climate Change (the “CCC”), which highlights that BECCS is both a critical part of the solution to achieve net zero emissions whilst also being part of an evolving, stable and flexible generation mix. On 24 June 2020, we announced that a new BECCS pilot facility will be installed within Drax’s CCUS Incubation Area in the autumn of 2020, when we expect to commence a trial of BECCS technology developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. This project will enhance Drax’s technical understanding for delivering negative emissions and help us drive forward our ambition to become carbon negative by 2030. Subject to the right support for the UK Government, we stand ready to develop and deliver this necessary contribution to the UK achieving net zero emissions by 2050. _Flexible and dispatchable development options_ In addition to BECCS at Drax Power Station, we are developing a pipeline of new dispatchable flexible generation assets that can support the long-term decarbonisation of the UK energy system and the growth of intermittent renewable energy. We are progressing development of options for four new rapid-response OCGT projects at the Eye (Suffolk), Hirwaun (South Wales), Millbrook (Bedfordshire) and Abergelli (Swansea) sites. If developed, each 154 ----- plant has the potential to provide flexible and reliable electricity to the UK electricity system and diversify our energy generation capability, subject to a positive investment decision and appropriate support through the Capacity Market. We believe that each plant will add 299MW in capacity. Our Damhead Creek site benefits from an option for the development of a further CCGT asset, Damhead Creek II, which would provide us with an additional 1.8GW of gas generation capacity. In addition, we have been granted a DCO approving the repowering of the retiring coal-fired generation capacity at Drax Power Station (approximately 1.3GW) with up to 3.6GW of gas generation capacity. Both projects have the potential to provide flexible and reliable electricity to the UK electricity system, serving near-term system support requirements and replacing less efficient capacity, thus reducing the total system CO2. This would further diversify our future energy generation capability, however both projects remain subject to a positive investment decision, appropriate support through the Capacity Market, and with respect to our repowering project, an acceptable outcome of judicial review proceedings. _Securing a future beyond 2027_ The diagram below illustrates how we have deployed our cash for 2016 to 2019 in order to strategically position ourselves for the future beyond 2027. ###### 2016-2019 CUMULATIVE NET CASH INVESTED 2,000 1,500 1,000 500 PPE Opus Software ScottishPower BECCS Biomass Pellet Plants OCGTs £m 2016 2019",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

In 2009, we acquired Ipswich-based Haven Power, which was launched in 2006 to serve the electricity needs of SME customers and to provide an alternative to the large multinational electricity suppliers. Since 2009, Haven Power has grown its SME business and established a business in the large I&C sector. In 2015, we commissioned two wood pellet manufacturing facilities in the US Gulf region as well as a port facility in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, used to load and ship wood pellets to Drax Power Station. In December 2016, we acquired four OCGT projects, comprising sites at Eye (Suffolk), Hirwaun (South Wales), Millbrook (Bedfordshire) and Abergelli (Swansea). In February 2017, we acquired Opus, primarily located in Northampton, a UK business-to-business supplier of electricity and gas focused on the SME market. In April 2017, we acquired a third wood pellet manufacturing facility in Urania, Louisiana. In December 2018, we acquired ScottishPower’s 2.6GW portfolio of pumped storage, hydro and gas-fired generation assets located across the UK, accelerating our development from a single-site generation business into a multi-site, multi-technology UK leading renewable generator.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

Our diversified generation portfolio of eight power stations includes capacity to generate 2.6GW from renewable biomass, 0.6GW from pumped storage and hydro and 2GW from gas-fired generation assets. These assets produce flexible, low-carbon and renewable electricity, and provide System Support Services to the UK electricity system. The System Support Services are increasingly important to the UK energy system in that it provides the flexibility required as it decarbonizes and becomes increasingly dominated by intermittent renewables technologies— principally wind. Between January 2018 and December 2019 our current portfolio of technically and geographically diverse generation assets consistently produced 12 per cent. of the UK’s renewable electricity, making us the fourth largest electricity generator in the UK based upon anticipated output (as published by the System Operator). Our generation facility at Drax Power Station, is the largest power station in the UK by generation capacity, with approximately 4.0GW of installed capacity primarily from four biomass-fired units and two legacy coalfired units. Since 2013, we have substantially decarbonised our generation from Drax Power Station, undertaking Europe’s largest decarbonisation project, by converting four of six legacy coal generation units to biomass. We also plan to retire the two remaining coal generation units from commercial generation in March 2021. Through our biomass-fired generation units, Drax Power Station is also the largest single-site renewable energy generation asset in the UK. Each of the generation units at Drax Power Station can be operated independently and has the flexibility to generate electricity at varying levels of output, enabling these generation units to provide a range of generation and System Support Services to the UK electricity system. Our pumped storage, hydro and CCGT assets are located across the UK, and also provide the flexible generation and non-generation System Support Services increasingly required by the UK energy system to enable higher levels of intermittent renewable generation. These assets therefore also earn revenues from power 155 ----- generation and non-commodity exposed contract revenues. One example of this is our Cruachan Power Station, a pumped storage asset operated by Drax, which won a synchronous compensator tender for a six year contract commencing in July 2020 to provide long-term System Support Services in this respect. This service can only be provided by technologies capable of providing ancillary services, including inertia and reactive power, without generating potentially unneeded electricity. Our purpose is to enable a zero carbon energy future and we have an ambition to be a carbon negative company by 2030, through the development of negative emissions. We aim to realise these ambitions through the delivery of our strategy, which has three strands: 1) create a long-term future for sustainable biomass; 2) be the leading provider of system support in the UK; and 3) give customers control of their energy. The UK electricity market has been experiencing a period of significant structural change. In the last decade, there has been a substantial increase in intermittent, renewable generation, which has rapidly displaced flexible, thermal generation. This historically provided the UK electricity system with a combination of reliable and flexible generation and the non-generation System Support Services that a well-functioning and stable electricity system requires. The Group’s portfolio of flexible, renewable and low-carbon generation assets is well placed to help the system operator manage the challenges of decarbonisation and system stability. As a strategic part of the UK’s critical national infrastructure, we recognise our responsibility to support the country’s response to Covid-19. We have remained in close contact with the UK Government and are committed to supplying the flexible, low-carbon and renewable electricity the UK needs, especially to the 181,500 businesses, including care homes, schools and hospitals we supply through our Customers segment. All of our operations have continued during the crisis, we have not sought any Covid-19 financial support from any government and no employees have been furloughed.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

The importance of sustainability to the business is underlined by the inclusion of sustainability performance as a key part of the Group Scorecard. As far as biomass sourcing is concerned, we rely on a number of internationally recognised forest certification programmes—for example the Sustainable Forest Initiative (SFI), Forest Stewardship Council[® ](FSC[®]) and the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC). These programmes ensure Drax’s suppliers manage their forests responsibly in accordance with high ESG standards. We also co-founded the Sustainable Biomass Program (SBP), a certification system designed for woody biomass, mostly in the form of wood pellets and woodchips, used in industrial, large-scale energy production. SBP certification provides assurance that woody biomass is supplied from legal and sustainable sources and that all regulatory requirements in relation to biomass for energy production are met. In terms of overall ESG performance, we maintain a AA rating with MSCI and have been awarded an ESG Risk Rating of 25.9 (Medium Risk) by Sustainalytics—two recognised leading independent providers of ESG research and ratings. Sustainalytics also awarded us a relative ESG performance ranking of 2nd of 61 for Independent Power Production and Traders by Subindustry Group. We are the UK’s largest single source of renewable electricity and flexible low-carbon and renewable electricity. With our multi-site, multi-technology asset portfolio, we are ideally placed to provide significant flexibility to support increasing numbers of intermittent renewables coming on to the grid. In addition to the ability to provide baseload renewable generation from our biomass generating units, our portfolio has the flexibility to provide System Support Services including the ability to provide power within seconds to balance demand and to generate electricity to balance other critical grid requirements, such as balancing voltage or inertia.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

The UK has a stated target to increase the proportion of its electricity generation from offshore wind to 30 per cent. by 2030 and a wider commitment to reducing GHG emissions to net zero by 2050. The UK Government has committed £557 million for the future Contract for Difference auctions for offshore wind, incentivizing a pipeline of new investments. However, intermittent renewable generation is dependent on favourable weather conditions and is therefore less able to respond to fluctuations in electricity demand. Recent extreme weather events (for example, changes in the behaviour of the polar vortex) and corresponding peaks in demand have demonstrated the limitations of intermittent generation. In Winter 2016/2017 and Winter 2017/2018, the UK and Europe experienced extended periods of very low temperatures coupled with little to no wind, putting strain on UK and European system infrastructure, leading to elevated electricity prices as well as observable large spikes in electricity prices during certain periods. Additionally, in the first half of 2020 Covid-19 caused a reduction in demand for electricity, which in turn caused the system operator to take more action to balance the system, procuring System Support Services from flexible generators like Drax. Following one of the UK’s largest blackouts in more than a decade on 9 August 2019, an Ofgem report into the incident recommended a number of actions to make the UK’s energy system more resilient to sudden losses of power, including a review of the costs and benefits of additional flexibility and reserve capacity to mitigate against similar future events. In January 2020, the Government announced that it will implement all ten clear actions recommended in the report, and has formed the Energy Emergency Executive Committee group to work towards a more resilient power system. To achieve the UK’s net zero 2050 commitment and support the increase in intermittent wind and solar generation, there will be a need for complementary flexible generation assets that can provide System Support Services and alter their generation profiles at any point in time to support the changing levels of intermittent generation. Our flexible, renewable and low-carbon generation portfolio allows us to meet the increasing need for System Support Services arising from the increase in intermittent generation in the system more broadly and particularly at times of system strain, and play an important role in the UK’s security of energy supply. The reduction in thermal generation capacity in the UK outlined above means that there are fewer operators and plants available in the long term to provide such services, and even fewer who can do so in the low carbon way that we are able to offer through our biomass, hydro and pumped storage assets. We have a significant pipeline of generation options which will, if developed, enable us to provide flexible baseload generation and additional System Support Services, further strengthening our position as a provider of such services.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654
74_1,Offerings 2020.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.21,Strengths,521.21.5,Our earnings benefit from a high degree of stability and visibility.,"As we continue to move away from non-renewable fuels, and with growth in non-generation System Support Services and our biomass supply and Customers segment, we expect our Adjusted EBITDA to be derived predominantly from non-commodity exposed sources of earnings in the future. 157 ----- Our earnings have a high degree of stability and visibility as a result of: - earnings from our biomass-fired generation units under the CfD Regime and RO Scheme (see below), the latter of which allows us to flexibly optimise our generation across our RO-accredited units, substantially reducing our operational risk; - Capacity Market payments and System Support Services contracts for a range of our generation assets; - a naturally hedged portfolio of generation assets and businesses through the value chain; - a long-term hedging policy; and - increased control over fuel input costs via an integrated biomass supply chain. As a consequence of this trend, the volatility of our earnings, which had historically characterised our cash flows prior to our decarbonisation efforts, is substantially reduced. We now have long-term visibility of our cash flows, underpinned by a more diverse generation portfolio and operational flexibility. _Long-term contracted Government revenues_ Generation from Drax Power Station’s existing biomass generation units benefits from a UK legislative and contractual framework designed to support renewable energy sources. One of our biomass-fired generation units receives support through the CfD Regime, while our other three biomass-fired generation units are supported under the RO Scheme (which, in the current RO compliance year, pay a premium of approximately £54 per MWH above the market price). The support we receive under both regimes extends to 2027. As a renewable fuel, biomass is exempt from the EU ETS and Carbon Price Support. Our CfD is a private law contract between Drax Power and a Government-owned entity, the Low Carbon Contracts Company Limited. Under our CfD, we are paid any shortfall, and repay any excess, between a strike price and a market reference price calculated as the average market price for electricity in the UK market over a given period. Our CfD is indexed to the UK consumer price index and extends to March 2027. It provides an effective hedge against the electricity price at current market prices and thereby supports earnings stability and visibility for our business. We also received an Investment Contract in respect of our third biomass unit, providing a visible earnings stream out to 2027. See “Industry Overview—Overview of Electricity Market Reform—Investment _Contracts”._ The RO Scheme, established in 2002 to encourage the development of large-scale renewable electricity capacity in the UK, places an obligation on licensed electricity suppliers either to source a proportion of the electricity they provide to customers from eligible renewable sources or to make a payment equal to the buy-out price. The buy-out price increases in line with UK retail price index each year. The sourcing of renewable energy is demonstrated by the supplier presenting ROCs (equivalent in number to the supplier’s individual obligation) to the administrator of the RO Scheme, Ofgem. ROCs are issued by Ofgem to renewable generators for each MWh of renewable electricity generated in different proportions based on the type of technology used. Electricity suppliers can source ROCs from renewable electricity generators. ROCs are tradable certificates with no fixed price, and therefore, the amount an electricity supplier pays for a ROC is a matter for negotiation between the supplier and generator. As a result of the RO Scheme, our Generation segment receives ROCs that, as a vertically-integrated renewable energy generator, we can use in our Customers segment or sell to third parties. A proportion of the underlying electricity produced by our ROC-accredited units can be sold on a forward basis in order to improve the stability and visibility of our cash flows. We currently receive one ROC for each MWh of generation from three of our biomass-fired generation units, on top of the purchase price for the sale of electricity produced. ROC support for two of these units is grandfathered by the Government at the level of one ROC for each MWh of generation until March 2027. The number of ROCs earnt in any one period is capped based on an annual limit set by the Government based on estimated baseload generation for two units and a smaller allowance for the third unit. We optimise generation within this cap so as to generate more at times of higher system need, typically winter periods, which are also generally periods of higher power prices. Our most recently converted biomass-fired generation unit does not benefit from grandfathering but is still eligible to receive ROCs until March 2027. See “Industry Overview—UK _Clean Energy Legislation—Grandfathering of support under the Renewables Obligation”._ The RO Scheme was updated in July 2018, enabling us to optimise generation across the RO-accredited generation units of Drax Power Station (whether grandfathered or not) subject to an overall cap at the power station level (see “Industry Overview—UK clean energy legislation—Grandfathering of support under the Renewables _Obligation”). The flexibility afforded by the cap mitigates operational risks across our biomass-fired_ 158 ----- generation units, allowing us to use the spare generating capacity by increasing generation in one unit to cater for unplanned outages in another, thereby enabling us to deliver a more consistent generation and earnings profile from biomass generation. Some of our hydro facilities also receive support under the RO Scheme. We receive one ROC for each MWh of generation at our Lanark hydro facility and our Galloway hydro facility receives regulatory support from the RO Scheme with respect to approximately 28MW of its 109MW generating capacity at a rate of one ROC for each MWh of generation, which substantially enhances returns given the zero cost of fuel to operate the assets. _Generation capacity and system support_ With increasing levels of intermittent generation, we are continuing to identify opportunities to create value from our ability to flexibly operate our generation assets according to prevailing market conditions, such as short term power and balancing market activity and the provision of other System Support Services. To capture value in this market, we focus resources on optimising availability and flexibility of our biomass, pumped storage, hydro, gas and retiring coal generation assets. The System Operator is required to balance supply and demand and to ensure the secure and stable operation of the Transmission System. In addition to its operation of the Balancing Mechanism, it routinely contracts with generators to provide System Support Services. The diverse technologies and geographic spread of our generation portfolio means we are well placed to offer a range of System Support Services and provide an opportunity for further contract-based revenues. We are able to provide System Support Services to the System Operator, such as “frequency response” (altering output to ensure the frequency of electricity in the Transmission System is within statutory limits); “reactive power” services (enabling the System Operator to manage the voltage profile of the Transmission System within certain parameters); and, at our Cruachan pumped storage power plant, “Spin Gen” (enabling generation to commence at short notice if required by the System Operator). As the UK’s electricity market evolves, the types and tenor of System Support Services being procured by the System Operator is changing. For example, in January 2020, one of the Cruachan pumped storage hydro station’s four turbines secured a six-year contract to provide System Support Services to the UK electricity system, which commenced in July 2020 and is expected to result in contract-based revenues of approximately £29 million between 1 April 2020 and 31 March 2026 in aggregate. In addition, our Drax Power Station and Damhead Creek assets both provide foot room reserve services. We actively engage with the System Operator to offer System Support Services (either contracted or utilised in the Balancing Mechanism, collectively known as Balancing Services) to meet system needs such as “frequency response” (the automatic change in generation output to ensure the frequency of electricity in the Transmission System is within statutory limits); generating or absorbing “reactive power” (the means by which systems voltage is maintained within acceptable levels); reserve (the ability to increase or reduce generation to balance the Transmission System when instructed by the System Operator to do so; and restoration (the capability to assist in the Transmission System following a full or partial shutdown). The provision of these services is an important source of revenue for us, amounting to £51 million in the first half of 2020 (compared to £47 million in the first half of 2019). These figures include pumped storage wholesale power sales and pumping costs, which are undertaken when market prices are favourable. We continue to explore options for other existing or retiring generating assets in our fleet to provide similar such services in the future. In addition, our pipeline of development options which, if developed, would be well suited to provide these System Support Services to further support the UK electricity system. These options include the ability to increase capacity at our Cruachan pumped storage asset, the opportunity to develop our Damhead Creek II site into a 1.8GW CCGT plant, the development of up to four 299MW rapid response OCGT projects; and the repowering of the remaining two retiring coal-fired generation units at Drax Power Station to gas. Each of these options, if developed (which will be in line with our capital allocation policy whilst maintaining a conservative net leverage profile) would also improve our ability to provide many of these services. The UK has established a Capacity Market scheme to support the security and reliability of supply for the end consumer. The Capacity Market provides a payment for reliable sources of capacity alongside their electricity revenues, to ensure they deliver energy when needed. Existing generators which are successful in the auction receive a one-year Capacity Market agreement. Plants requiring significant refurbishment may also be eligible for three-year Capacity Market agreements. Potential new build generating stations may be eligible for 15-year Capacity Market agreements, if they meet certain criteria. Other types of capacity are eligible to participate, including interconnectors and demand side response. 159 ----- We have secured index-linked Capacity Market agreements for certain of our pumped storage, hydro and CCGT assets, which are expected to result in contract-based revenues in excess of £209.4 million in aggregate between January 2019 and 30 September 2024. We have similar agreements for our two coal-fired generation units until 30 September 2022 and the three small ancillary gas turbines located at Drax Power Station until 30 September 2024, which are expected to result in contract-based revenues of approximately £84.3 million between January 2019 and 30 September 2024 in aggregate. Included in the above is the contracts that were secured through participating in the T-3 Capacity Market Auction held in January 2020 and have provisionally secured agreements to provide approximately 2,333MW of de-rated capacity from our Damhead Creek, Rye House and Shoreham CCGT assets, the Drax gas turbines, the Cruachan pumped storage plant and the Galloway hydro power plant in the year commencing 1 October 2022. A T-4 Capacity Market Auction is due to be held in January 2021, for which the results of National Grid ESO’s prequalification process are expected in late October 2020. We will only accept a contract for participating development projects where it is economically attractive and in line with our capital allocation policy and adheres to a conservative net leverage profile. _A naturally hedged portfolio of generation assets and businesses through the value chain_ We are a multi-site, multi-technology operator and our ability to generate using a range of different technologies with different dispatch economics means we are less exposed to risks inherent to single technologies and movements in individual commodity prices. For example, if power prices and gas spreads fall due to high wind it will decrease the margin available at our thermal sites but the reduced number of thermal plants on the system is likely to increase the level of system support and balancing services required by National Grid, increasing the opportunities for pumped storage as well as the gas units through balancing market activities. At an operational level, we trade our generation assets as a single portfolio, leveraging our established expertise to optimise the running of our assets to maximise returns. We operate an integrated value chain across our three core segments (pellet production, generation and our Customers segment), enabling us to optimise the timing and delivery of sustainable business we produce to meet our renewable generation requirements at Drax Power Station. In turn, our Generation segment provides flexible, low-carbon and renewable electricity to our Customers segment for onward supply to business customers. _Hedging policy_ The earnings of our Generation segment are further supported by our long-term hedging policy pursuant to which we sell electricity generated up to two years in advance. This allows us to secure a margin on such electricity at times when margins for a given generation technology are attractive, thereby increasing visibility with respect to our future Generation segment earnings. As of 22 July 2020, we had contracted fixed price power sales (including both forward sold electricity and gas proxy hedges) of approximately 17.6TWh, 11.4TWh and 4.8TWh for delivery in 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Our average achieved prices for fixed price power sales of forward sold electricity in 2020, 2021 and 2022 were £53.8 per MWh, £49.0 per MWh and £48.2 per MWh, respectively. Our business is subject to risks due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, in particular, the weakening of sterling relative to other operational currencies, as most of the biomass we purchase is priced in US dollars, Canadian dollars or euro. We operate a long-term hedging policy with a five-year hedging period to manage the risk of a change in the relative values of the US dollar, Canadian dollar or euros relative to the pound sterling, which may increase our suppliers’ cost of business and ultimately our cost of goods sold with respect to biomass. _Increased control over fuel input costs via an integrated biomass supply chain_ Our wood pellet manufacturing facilities have a combined annual nameplate capacity of 1,475,000 tonnes, comprising capacity of 512,500 tonnes at each of our Amite and Morehouse facilities and 450,000 tonnes of capacity at our LaSalle facility, and have operated at or near nameplate capacity in the six months to 30 June 2020. Our US port facility in Baton Rouge, Louisiana has an annual export capacity of 2,100,000 tonnes (with the scope to expand further to 3,000,000 tonnes), which exceeds our current self-supply, enabling us to consolidate supply from third parties to drive further supply chain efficiencies until we are able to increase our selfsupply of biomass in the coming years. Our current US operations are strategically located near one another for operational efficiencies, including optimising the time and cost of wood pellet deliveries to our Baton Rouge port facility. In the first half of 2020, our wood pellet manufacturing facilities produced approximately 753,000 tonnes of wood pellets and our US port facility shipped 747,000 tonnes of wood pellets to Drax Power Station. In 2019, 160 ----- wood pellets manufactured at our own facilities accounted for 22 per cent. of the biomass used at Drax Power Station with the balance sourced from third party suppliers based in North America and Europe under a series of predominantly long-term contracts from sources also certified as sustainable. We aim to increase the amount of pellets we self-supply up to 5,000,000 tonnes per annum by 2027 (71 per cent. of our internal requirement for the year ended 31 December 2019). In furtherance of this aim, we are in the process of increasing capacity at our LaSalle, Amite and Morehouse facilities by 350,000 tonnes in aggregate over the next two years. In addition, over the same time period we expect to complete construction of three new satellite pellet plants, with nameplate capacity of 120,000 tonnes per year and the potential to increase this to 500,000 tonnes. We expect that the production costs at these plants will be approximately 20 per cent. lower than our existing plants. Our ability to source an increasing proportion of our biomass requirements internally via self-supply allows us to better manage the quality of feedstock and the timing of deliveries. This allows us to drive down the cost of biomass, but also enables us to optimise generation and reduce the risk of fuel shortages and supply chain issues curtailing generation from Drax Power Station. Further to this, it allows us to better ensure a stable cost of biomass and reduce exposure to commodity price fluctuations. At the same time, we maintain the flexibility to participate in the biomass spot market when prices are attractive. To date there has been no material impact from Covid-19 on our biomass supply chain or those of our key biomass suppliers, nor has there been any material disruption due to Covid-19 to the shipping of our biomass by sea freight, port or rail.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

In recent years, as the Group has diversified and substantially grown, we have also reduced our business risk profile. Any temporary increase in leverage resulting from our corporate acquisitions have been followed by rapid deleveraging back to pre-acquisition levels. Our reported net leverage at the end of the last four calendar years has been between 0.7x and 1.8x. After the completion of the Opus Acquisition in February 2017, our consolidated pro forma net leverage as at 31 December 2016 only increased to 2.7x and decreased to 1.6x by the end of the calendar year; after the completion of the DGEL Acquisition in December 2018, our consolidated pro forma net leverage as at 31 December 2018 was 3.1x and decreased to 1.9x by 31 December 2019 and further decreased to 1.8x by 30 June 2020.

We are committed to maintaining leverage at a level that is consistent with our current crossover credit rating, which supports our trading strategy. See “Presentation of Financial Information and Other Information— _Non-IFRS Financial Measures”._ We have a disciplined focus on cash flow and working capital management and have not utilised our cash revolving credit facilities for over two years. We have a strong cash conversion profile with an average annual operating cash conversion for the last four calendar years of 125 per cent., reflecting ongoing low maintenance capital expenditure requirements combined with financial discipline. We announced our current dividend policy in June 2017, and this will pay a sustainable and growing dividend consistent with our commitment to a strong balance sheet and our ambitions for growth. We are focused on targeted selective investments which will help us continue diversifying our earnings and cash flow sources. We also expect our future maintenance capital expenditures to include investments to upgrade our facilities to, among other things, comply with applicable regulatory regimes, which we then expect to translate into greater operating cash flow going forward. We continue to invest in biomass strategy, although there has been some delay in investment due to Covid-19. In the first half of 2020, capital expenditure was £78 million, and the full year expected investment is £190 to £210 million. Further, future investments to increase our biomass self-supply capacity have been approved and will commence in the second half of 2020 in respect of three satellite plants. All decisions on investments and capital allocation are made in line with a prudent capital allocation policy. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations— _Capital and Operating Expenditure”._ We have robust credit policies in place to limit the amount of concentration risk we have with any counterparty (noting that the counterparty’s appetite to trade with us is itself based on its assessment of our credit profile). Sales to the Customers segment (as opposed to third parties) further reduce our concentration risk by spreading the Generation segment’s exposure to third-party credit risk across a wider customer base. 161 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

Management is supported by a skilled operating team who are at the forefront of biomass conversion technology, including the mechanical, engineering, electrical and civil works required for such conversion. Through the conversion of four coal units to biomass at Drax Power Station, acquisitions and organic growth we have successfully transformed a coal generation business into a vertically-integrated generator focused on flexible, low-carbon and renewable electricity. As a result of this transformation, we are an industry-leader in energy generation from biomass and its associated supply chain. We have also gained significant experience in integrating businesses into our existing operations, in particular following our acquisition of Opus on 17 February 2017 and the DGEL Assets on 31 December 2018. The conversion of the first three of our generation units to biomass remains Europe’s largest decarbonisation project, and was delivered on time and within budget. This experience enabled us to deliver the low-cost conversion of a fourth biomass-fired generation unit in August 2018 and positions us to continue to deliver significant biomass cost-savings and growth projects, as well as providing Drax with the ability to adapt to an evolving energy market and deliver on our pipeline of development projects. We have invested £1.6 billion of net cash since 2016 and have deployed strong underlying contracted cash flows for investments beyond 2027 when the current renewable support ends. Our operational experience in handling biomass is also market-leading. We have developed innovative fuel handling systems, logistics and storage solutions for biomass fuel as well as a bespoke, technically-advanced covered rail wagon with a specialised door design and a patented product flow control system to manage biomass during discharge. Further, we have developed an in-depth understanding of the scientific and technological effects of burning a range of biomass fuels, as well as of the critical combustion characteristics of such fuels. This positions us to identify and utilize new fuels (such as sugar cane and bagasse) at a reduced cost to the wood pellets we currently procure from third parties. Sustainability is at the heart of our culture and the sustainable sourcing of biomass is a core principle of the Group. We aim to lead in this area and, in 2017 we appointed a Senior Independent Non-Executive Director with expertise in sustainability. In 2019, we introduced a new Responsible Sourcing Policy for Biomass, which reflects the evolving science in the area and is based on recommendations by Forest Research and the European Climate Foundation, and which exceeds the requirements of the EU Renewable Energy Directive II. We also established an Independent Advisory Board chaired by Sir John Beddington, the UK’s former Chief Scientific Adviser, and including members of Forest Research. The IAB provides independent advice on the role of biomass in climate change mitigation and in supporting the transition to a net zero energy system, forest science and optimising carbon impacts, and societal expectations for responsible and sustainable biomass. The Independent Advisory  Board  has  reviewed  our  biomass  policy  and  confirmed  that  it  reflects  the recommendations made by Forest Research. We seek to source biomass from countries with large areas of growing forests and established forest industries and we comprehensively audit our carbon footprint across our entire biomass supply chain, conduct regular ISAE 3000 assured independent supplier audits and encourage the use of third party sustainability certification. All our biomass is procured in accordance with our Responsible Sourcing Policy for Biomass.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654
74_1,Offerings 2020.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.22,Strategy,521.22.1,Create a long-term future for sustainable biomass.,"The cost of biomass fuel is a key metric in determining the profitability of our biomass generation and our overall financial performance. We have a target to substantially reduce this cost by 2027 through increasing our self-supply of sustainable wood pellets, increasing our operational efficiency and developing a wider fuel envelope. In doing so, we expect to develop a long-term future for sustainable biomass. Our wood pellet manufacturing facilities in the US currently supply all of their output to Drax Power Station and supplied 1,535,000 tonnes (22 per cent.) of our internal requirements for generation from sustainable biomass in 2019. Our target is to increase this self-supply capability to 5,000,000 (71 per cent. of our internal requirement for the year ended 31 December 2019) by 2027, and in doing so become the world’s largest low-cost biomass producer and improve the certainty of self-supply, allowing us to take advantage of economies of scale 162 ----- and making us less susceptible to changes in the wholesale price of biomass. In furtherance of this target, we are increasing capacity at our LaSalle, Amite and Morehouse facilities by 350,000 tonnes in aggregate over the next two years (construction has started at LaSalle and Morehouse, and is expected to begin at Amite in 2021). Our current wood pellet manufacturing facilities are strategically located close to one another in the US Gulf region for operational and supply chain efficiencies. We intend to continue consolidating supply from third parties at our Baton Rouge port facility to utilise unused export capacity and to drive further supply chain efficiencies. Progress in the first half of 2020 included the approval of three new 40kt satellite plants at a cost of approximately $40 million in aggregate ($10-15 million per site). Construction work on the first plant is set to begin this year, which will utilise sawmill residues and share our existing US Gulf infrastructure to produce, we believe, biomass at around 20 per cent. below the current cost of production. Separately, we are undertaking a number of operational, technical and logistical initiatives across our biomass supply chain to further reduce the cost of biomass. This includes increasing the proportion of good quality wood pellets received at Drax Power Station, turbine upgrades and process modifications to improve combustion at Drax Power Station and improving our logistics. For example, in May 2019, we commissioned a new rail spur linking our LaSalle facility to the regional rail network and our port facility at Baton Rouge, which will increase transportation efficiency and economies of scale and reduce the cost and carbon footprint of our operations. Together with the Port of Baton Rouge and the State of Louisiana, we are also commissioning an enlarged chambering yard at our port facilities in Baton Rouge, allowing 80-car train sets to operate from our LaSalle and Morehouse sites. Following the success of the co-location of a sawmill next to our LaSalle facility, which became operational in January 2020, we are looking at identifying additional opportunities to locate sawmills near to our pellet facilities, in order to increase operational efficiency, secure low-cost fibre residues and ultimately to reduce the cost of biomass production. This programme of improvements is expected to deliver savings of $27 million per year by the end of 2020 and $64 million per year by the end of 2022. In addition to the above, we aim to leverage our knowledge of fuel chemistry obtained from our sustainable biomass generation to widen the sustainable biomass fuel options which we are able to use at Drax Power Station. We have set up a dedicated team tasked with identifying new fuels (such as sugarcane bagasse, woodchips and nutshells), forms and geographies which we could utilise at a reduced cost to the pellets we currently procure from third parties.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

To deliver on this carbon negative ambition we are developing a range of engineering options and working with a range of technology and industrial partners to apply BECCS technology to the biomass units at Drax Power Station. This technology will safely capture the vast majority of the carbon dioxide emitted in the biomass generation process and transports it via pipelines to storage sites under the North Sea. Our BECCS ambition aligns with the Government’s target to achieve net zero emissions across the UK economy by 2050 and the advice of its statutory advisory body, the CCC, which highlights that BECCS is both a critical part of the solution to achieve net zero whilst also being part of an evolving, stable and flexible generation mix. Each biomass unit utilising BECCS technology could capture approximately 4,000,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per annum. Working in partnership with a range of stakeholders, and with the right support from Government, we believe we are well placed to develop BECCS at scale in advance of 2030 and, in all, could provide up to a third of the negative emissions that the CCC has identified that the UK may require. 163 ----- We also expect global demand for wood pellets to increase this decade as other countries develop decarbonisation programmes which acknowledge the benefits of sustainable biomass for generation. Whilst there is an abundance of sustainable biomass globally, there remains limited capacity to convert these fibres to energy dense pellets, which have a low-carbon footprint and lower cost associated with transportation. As a result, we expect the global market for biomass to remain structurally short. We are therefore exploring options to service biomass demand in other markets, such as Europe, North America and Asia alongside the UK. In doing so, we are creating optionality over our use of sustainable biomass. The technology to deliver post-combustion BECCS exists and is proven at scale. We recently commenced a trial of one such technology provided by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries at the technology testing zone at Drax Power Station. This solvent technology is well established and is being used at 13 sites globally, notably at the Petra Nova facility in Texas, USA, the world’s largest post-combustion carbon capture plant, which is capable of capturing 1,400,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year. We are also piloting the carbon capture potential of an organic and potentially lower cost alternative solvent treatment developed by C-Capture Limited, and we expect to carry out further trials in 2021. This technology is also being piloted at the Tiller facility in Norway. We are also exploring the viability of alternative uses for CO2 including trials to assess use of biogenic CO2 in plastic and animal food use, and the development of synthetic zero-carbon fuels from hydrogen. Subject to the right support from the Government, we stand ready to develop and deliver this critical contribution to the UK achieving net zero emissions by 2050, which will also help us to achieve our ambition of becoming a carbon negative company by 2030.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

Accordingly, the Group’s earnings were volatile and exposed to commodity price and/or merchant risk. In recent years, our earnings have diversified and the Group’s exposure to commodity price risk has been substantially reduced. In the Generation segment, we maintain our visibility of future earnings and cash flows through the contracted earnings of Capacity Market and System Support Services payments. We expect that, combined with the support we receive under the CfD Regime and RO Scheme for our biomass and hydro generation assets, this will continue to result in a reduced level of commodity markets exposure and increased stability and visibility of earnings. We have secured index-linked Capacity Market agreements for certain of our pumped storage, hydro and CCGT assets, which are expected to result in contract-based revenues in excess of £209.4 million in aggregate between January 2019 and 30 September 2024. We have similar agreements for our two coal-fired generation units until 30 September 2022 and the three small ancillary gas turbines located at Drax Power Station until 30 September 2024, which are expected to result in contract-based revenues of approximately £84.3 million between January 2019 and 30 September 2024 in aggregate. Looking forward, any final investment decision in respect of any one of our pipeline of development options will be subject to appropriate support to deliver stable contract-based revenues in line with our capital allocation policy whilst maintaining a conservative net leverage profile. 164 ----- With increasing levels of intermittent generation on the UK electricity system, we are continuing to identify opportunities to flexibly operate our generation assets according to prevailing market conditions, such as the provision of short-term power and balancing market activity and the provision of other System Support Services. The flexible, dispatchable and responsive nature of our generation assets positions us to compete in the market over the short and medium term and our pipeline of development projects will, if developed, further bolster our offering in this regard. With the changing grid dynamic, we expect the market for System Support Services to grow. As the UK’s electricity market evolves, the types and tenor of System Support Services being procured by the System Operator is changing. For example, in January 2020, one of the Cruachan pumped storage hydro station’s four turbines secured a six-year contract to provide System Support Services to the UK electricity system, which commenced in July 2020 and is expected to result in contract-based revenues of approximately £29 million between 1 April 2020 and 31 March 2026 in aggregate. In addition, our Drax Power Station and Damhead Creek assets both provide foot room reserve services. It is our intention to offer further assets to tender for similar System Support Services in the future and we will continue to position the business so that it is able to meet the requirements of an increasingly complex UK electricity system.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

In the same way that the Generation segment provides system support, so too can our industrial customer portfolio. Over time, we expect this business, through efficiency and demand-side response, to contribute increasingly to system support. We continue to believe this approach will support long-term growth. Our Customers segment was the fifth largest supplier of electricity to businesses in the UK by volume supplied as of 30 April 2020, was the largest provider of renewable energy to businesses and the UK leading business to business only supplier. As at 30 April 2020, we supplied 281,500 electricity and gas meters and, in the six months ended 30 June 2020, we supplied 8.8TWh of electricity and gas and our fuel mix disclosure for the period April 2019 to March 2020 100 per cent of our electricity was from renewable generation. As at 30 April 2020, our share of the B2B electricity market was 8 percent. As the power system decarbonises, we believe that there is a significant opportunity for the Group to leverage our status as a vertically integrated utility with a diverse range of assets to provide an evolving range of innovative and flexible solutions to business customers enabling them to manage their energy demand and requirements, which will drive market share growth and increased profitability in the Customers segment. In the first half of 2020, the Customers segment reported a loss. This reflects the significant reduction in demand caused by Covid-19, the cost associated with exiting hedged positions as market prices have fallen and the increased risk and provisioning for business failure and bad debt—principally in the SME market, which represents 30 per cent. of monthly billing. The combined revenues for Opus Energy Limited and Opus Gas Supply Limited, which supply SME customers, were £626.8 million in 2019, 27 per cent. of our £2.35 billion total revenues in the Customers business. We estimate that there is approximately £100 million of SME revenue within the Haven Power Limited revenues in 2019, which would increase this to 31 per cent. However, even with social distancing measures eased we expect the impact of Covid-19 to continue in the second half of 2020 and 2021. Despite the Covid-19 pandemic, the I&C business performed better and has added long dated contracts with water utilities to the portfolio, providing revenue visibility over the next five years.

The majority of our generation output is produced from our sustainable biomass-fired generation units at Drax Power Station. Our nationwide generation portfolio enables us to meet the growing need for forms of generation that are flexible and dispatchable in response to changes in the needs of the electricity grid in Great Britain whilst delivering increased visibility of long-term earnings and a relatively high proportion of non-commodity related earnings. Our ability to generate electricity using a variety of different technologies with different dispatch economics and provide a range of System Support Services means we are less exposed to risks inherent to single technologies and movements in individual commodity prices. _Thermal generation assets_ Drax Power Station is located in North Yorkshire, on the banks of the River Ouse, between the towns of Selby and Goole. The Drax Power Station site, comprising approximately 1,850 acres, is close to supplies of cooling water and has convenient road and rail access to nearby port capacity. Drax Power Station is the largest power station in the UK, with approximately 4.0GW of connected installed capacity from its six main generation units, each of which can be operated independently. Between 2013 and 2018, four of the six generation units were converted to run on sustainable biomass, the first three units of which formed the largest single decarbonisation project completed in Europe. In 2019, we completed the first in a series of three high-pressure turbine upgrades of our biomass units which will further increase efficiency and reduce maintenance costs. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—The reduction or _abandonment of governmental support for generation of electricity from biomass or other relevant changes in governmental energy policy may materially adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition and results of operations”._ Four of Drax Power Station’s main generation units run exclusively on sustainable biomass and two units currently burn coal and coal derivatives. In 2019, our biomass life cycle carbon emissions were 124kg of CO2 per MWh of electricity generated, well below the 2015-2020 UK limit of 285kg of CO2 emissions per MWh of electricity generated. This calculation compares the supply chain emissions for all biomass used by us against the CO2 emissions which would have been created through the combustion of coal. For the purposes of this calculation, the biogenic CO2 emissions from burning sustainable biomass at Drax Power Station are considered to be zero in line with the methodology developed by the UNFCCC and reflecting that the CO2 released in the process of burning sustainable biomass has been absorbed from the atmosphere during the growth of the feedstock. The four generation units that have been converted to biomass are capable of burning approximately eight million tonnes of sustainable biomass per year. For further information on carbon emissions, see “Industry Overview—Electricity _market: regulatory context—The EU Emissions Trading System” and “Industry Overview—UK clean energy legislation”._ Generation from coal accounted for only approximately four per cent. of our generation during the year ended 31 December 2019 and we plan to end commercial coal generation at Drax Power Station in 2021 and close the coal units in 2022, allowing us to transition away from coal-fired generation entirely. We have been granted a DCO approving the repowering of our retiring coal-fired generation capacity (approximately 1.3GW) at Drax Power Station with up to 3.6GW of gas generation capacity, subject to the outcome of judicial review proceedings, a positive investment decision and other approvals and the receipt of an appropriate Capacity Market agreement in future Capacity Market auctions. This repowering would utilise existing infrastructure to deliver a low cost solution for new gas-fired generation and reduce carbon emissions versus coal, with a wide operating range covering baseload and peak power generation. Our CCGT power stations at Damhead Creek (805MW), Rye House (715MW) and Shoreham (420MW) are all located in the South-East of England where they benefit from grid access income associated with their location in the South-East of England, where energy demand is highest in the country, and provide baseload and peak power generation and other System Support Services. Their location also allows the assets to deliver 166 ----- electricity while incurring lower transmission charges. Damhead Creek is regularly used in the Balancing Mechanism for energy. In addition to these stations, we also own a small CCGT power station at Blackburn Mill (60MW) in Northern England. We are also progressing a permitted option for the development of a 1.8GW CCGT plant at Damhead Creek, which would require sufficient Capacity Market or similar support to be developed. For further information on the Capacity Market, see “Industry Overview—Overview of Electricity Market Reform— _Capacity Market”._ The UK electricity market is changing. A greater amount of intermittent generating capacity is becoming available to the market and, at the same time, older and less efficient thermal plants with the ability to generate electricity more consistently are withdrawing. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has stated that 70-85 per cent. of global electricity will need to come from renewables by 2050 if the target of limiting the worldwide temperature increase to 1.5C is going to be achieved. Additionally, most renewable generation is intermittent in nature. In this context, there is a greater need for the forms of generation found in our portfolio that are flexible and responsive and able to provide the non-generation services a well-functioning and secure electricity system requires. _Thermal generation process_ To generate electricity from either sustainable biomass or coal, the underlying fuel is pulverised into a powder and then blown into boilers, where the fuel is burned. The heat generated by the boiler turns demineralised water into super-heated steam at 568 degrees Celsius, which is fed at high pressure through a series of turbines. The shafts of these turbines are coupled to large cylindrical electromagnets known as rotors, which produce electricity as the turbine rotates. The electricity generated is then increased from 23.5kV to 400kV, allowing for the export of electricity onto the Transmission System. The electricity is eventually reduced to 230V for use by customers. The de-mineralised water in the boilers forms part of a closed system and, once turned into super-heated steam and fed through the high-pressure turbines, is returned to the boiler for reheating before passing through further intermediate and low pressure turbines to increase the overall efficiency of the generation process. Subsequently the steam is condensed and recycled back into the boiler. Excess heat in the form of water vapour is released into the atmosphere by way of cooling towers. Due to Drax Power Station’s design, each unit can operate full time as a baseload generator, or can turn up or down or be taken off line and put back on line with minimal effect on the operating capabilities of the other units. Similarly, the two gas units at our 805MW Damhead Creek CCGT power station and three gas turbines at our 715MW Rye House CCGT power station can each turn up or down or be taken off line and put back on line with minimal effect on the operating capabilities of the other respective gas turbine(s) at those stations. At Drax Power Station and each of our CCGT power stations, generation increases when demand is high, units are available and it is economic for a unit (whether coal, gas or sustainable biomass) to run. In the competitive UK wholesale electricity market, the economics of running a unit are determined by the short-run marginal cost of each technology, which is based on the variable cost of generating a unit of electricity for the relevant half-hour. When there is demand for electricity, the generators that are available with the lowest short-run marginal cost operate until the projected demand in that half-hour is met, subject to balancing actions taken by the System Operator. Due to the higher cost of carbon in the form of the total carbon price, the cost of coal generation today compared to other available generation is higher than it has been historically. As such, Drax Power Station’s coal-fired generation units are not expected to deliver baseload electricity for significant lengths of time prior to their closure or repowering, and are increasingly run to provide electricity to the grid when there are low levels of generation from intermittent sources of energy (e.g., during low-wind periods) or in the balancing mechanism to provide System Support Services. In contrast, the biomass-fired generation units, which benefit from renewable energy support under either the RO Scheme or the CfD Regime, are predominantly delivering either baseload electricity or electricity in peak periods when optimal to do so within the ROC cap under the RO scheme. For further information on the RO Scheme see “Industry Overview—UK Clean Energy Legislation—The Renewables _Obligation”._ Our CCGT power stations produce electricity by using both gas and steam turbine configurations. The gas turbines are powered by natural gas. The fuel is combusted and the resulting heat is converted into mechanical energy, which in turn drives associated electrical generators. The hot gas turbine exhaust gas is used to generate steam in a HRSG (Heat Recovery Steam Generator) which in turn powers a steam turbine which is directly coupled to an electrical generator. By combining the gas and steam processes, the overall efficiency of the CCGT is higher than OCGT units. 167 ----- Our CCGT power stations have a significantly lower cost of carbon than coal units and therefore tend to operate more frequently, albeit none are expected to deliver baseload electricity for significant periods of time. Our CCGTs at Damhead Creek and Shoreham are expected to run most days through the year at times when electricity demand is high, whereas Rye House, which has a lower efficiency, is expected to provide System Support Services or to run for short periods in the balancing mechanism (for example on low wind days). _Pumped storage generation assets and process_ The Cruachan pumped storage hydro power plant is located in Argyll and Bute, Scotland. The Cruachan power plant is built inside the hollowed-out rock of a mountain, Ben Cruachan. It uses electricity from the grid at times of low demand, when electricity prices are generally lower, to pump water from Loch Awe to its storage reservoir part way up the mountain and collects water from the surrounding hills. At times of peak demand, when electricity prices are generally higher, water is released from the reservoir through the station’s turbines to generate electricity. Cruachan, which provides 30 per cent. of the UK’s pumped-hydro storage capacity, can provide longduration storage with the ability to achieve full load in 30 seconds, which it can maintain for 15 hours, making it a strategically important asset for the Group, remunerated by a range of non-commodity based revenues such as System Support Services income and revenues from participation in the Balancing Mechanism. Cruachan’s four electricity generation units currently have a total capacity of 440MW, two of which generate up to 120MW, and the other two up to 100MW. Cruachan has four primary modes of operation: generating (supplying electricity to the transmission system), pumping (taking electricity from the transmission system), spin gen (spinning without waterflow, to ready the system to generate electricity at short notice) and spin pump (spinning without waterflow, to ready the system to pump at short notice). The facility can deliver a range of balancing services and System Support Services, including frequency response (altering output to ensure the frequency of electricity in the Transmission System is within statutory limits) or generating or absorbing reactive power (the means by which system voltage is maintained within acceptable levels). In January 2020, Cruachan Power Station was successful in a stability tender for a six-year contract to provide System Support Services to the System Operator, starting in July 2020. Under this contract, one of the four turbines (generally a 100MW turbine) will not be used for power generation and will instead be used exclusively to provide System Support Services. The plant can switch between the modes to meet commercial requirements or as required by the System Operator. _Hydro generation assets and process_ The Galloway (109MW) and Lanark (17MW) run-of-river power plants are located in south-west Scotland. Galloway and Lanark are distribution-connected stations capable of generating stable renewable electricity using the energy from flowing water. Since they have no fuel costs, they can run in a cost-efficient manner even at times of minimum demand. Our Lanark facility is powered by three waterfalls, and uses weirs to divert water from the river to generate electricity. Our Galloway facility was the first large-scale integrated hydro complex to be built in Great Britain and consists of six power stations, eight dams and a network of tunnels, aqueducts and pipelines. Lanark benefits from index-linked ROC revenues in respect of its full generating capacity, extending until 2027. Galloway benefits from index-linked ROC revenues with respect to approximately 28MW of its generation capacity until 2027, at which point we will lose support under this regime. Galloway also operates a reservoir and dam system providing power storage capabilities and opportunities for peaking and System Support Services. _Availability_ Availability of the generating units at our power stations is influenced by planned maintenance outages, as well as unplanned or forced outages, which are required from time to time to rectify malfunctions or other failures. In the first half of 2020, Drax generated approximately 9.9TWh of electricity compared to 8.3TWh in the second half of 2019, principally due to reducing coal generation further than is offset by the additional generation from the DGEL Assets. Drax Power Station generated 8.4TWh of this amount. Our maintenance regime for each unit at Drax Power Station typically includes a major planned outage once every four years to enable a detailed examination of each part of the pressure system plant and other repair requirements. Our gas-fired generation units typically includes a major planned outage of the rotating equipment every four to eight years, driven by operating context and a major planned outage once every four years to enable a detailed examination of each part of the pressure system plant. Planned outages are usually undertaken during the summer months, when electricity demand is lower. In anticipation of an end to unabated electricity 168 ----- generation from coal by 2024 and our subsequently announced retirement of the coal units by September 2022, we have implemented a leaner maintenance schedule for the two coal fired generation units and deferred certain maintenance work. In addition, as our CCGT generating units are at the mid-to-end of their life range, it will be necessary to upgrade these facilities to extend their useful economic life and mitigate increased technical risks. See _“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and _Capital Resources—Capital Expenditure”._ We completed two major outages at Drax Power Station during the year ended 31 December 2019, one of which included the completion of the first in a series of three high-pressure turbine upgrades. We also completed planned outages at our Rye House and Shoreham CCGT power stations. A minor inspection was also completed at our Damhead Creek CCGT power station during 2019. In 2020 a major outage is being carried out on our third biomass unit at Drax Power Station, which has a similar scope of work as the outage carried out on the second unit in 2019, including an upgrade to the high pressure turbines. This outage has been delayed into the second half of the year to accommodate Covid-19 restrictions and is still ongoing. A major outage has also been completed at the Damhead Creek gas power station which based on current forecasts will provide starts and running hours sufficient to run to 2028 before another major outage will be required. Smaller outages have also taken place on all first half units at Drax Power Station and Ryehouse gas power station. To comply with the Reservoirs Act (Scotland) 2011, our maintenance regime of our hydro assets comprises a series of planned routine tests of emergency apparatuses associated with dam safety, annual inspections by a Reservoir Panel Engineer and a 10-year thorough examination by an independent Dam Panel Inspection Engineer. Our maintenance regime for the traditional turbine generator assets at our hydro facilities typically includes annual inspections, minor planned outages every four years and major planned outages every 12 years to complement a routine preventative maintenance regime. Unplanned maintenance or forced outages can occur on all units due to unexpected plant breakdown, such as boiler tube leaks. Preventative maintenance is carried out to control and reduce forced outage rates and includes the monitoring, inspection and replacement of operating equipment. We have recently introduced advanced condition monitoring technology at Drax Power Station to proactively identify and cure latent issues that are not otherwise visible before they result in more significant outages in future. The frequency of our monitoring and inspection work is dependent on the operating and failure history of each equipment type and takes into account historical maintenance schedules and procedures, manufacturers’ recommendations and statutory inspection requirements. This approach is typical of the industry. _Fuel procurement_ Drax Power Station uses sustainable biomass and coal as fuel. In the Generation segment, cost of fuel is the principal driver of total cost of sales and this represents the cost of purchasing the coal (including the cost of carbon) and sustainable biomass that is used to generate electricity in Drax Power Station (net of any ROC support earned) and gas (including the cost of carbon) for our gas powered assets. Sustainable biomass costs were £569.4 million in the first half of 2020, £545.3 million in the second half of 2019 and £469.8 million in the first half of 2019. Gas costs were £43.0 million in the first half of 2020, £60.2 million in the second half of 2019, and £67.9 million in the first half of 2019. Coal costs were £49.5 million in the first half of 2020, £6.6 million in the second half of 2019, and £20.4 million in the first half of 2019. _Sustainable biomass_ In 2019, approximately 7 million tonnes of sustainable biomass were burned for electricity generation at Drax Power Station. Our three wood pellet manufacturing facilities currently have the capacity to supply approximately 22 per cent. of our internal requirements, increasing to 24 per cent. once our 350kt aggregate expansion of the Morehouse, Amite and LaSalle plants is complete. Our self-supply capacity will increase further when the three new satellite plants are operational, we expect these will provide an additional nameplate capacity of 120,000 tonnes per annum by 2022. In the first half of 2020, our wood pellet manufacturing facilities actually supplied 19 per cent. of our internal requirements for generation from sustainable biomass in the first half of 2020, as we used an increased proportion of our own biomass pellets in Q1 2019 to offset an industry-wide shortage of third party pellets caused by unseasonably poor weather. Our strategic target is to increase our self- supply to five million tonnes per annum by 2027. We have established a programme of improvements and expansion designed to deliver $27 million in annual savings by the end of 2020, and $64 million in annual savings by 2022 (this represents a saving of $35 per tonne or £13 per MWh on a volume of 1.85Mt using a constant foreign exchange rate of 1.4500). 169 ----- To make up the shortfall between our own production capacity for sustainable biomass pellets and our requirements for sustainable biomass pellets, we have negotiated a portfolio of predominantly long-term biomass fuel supply contracts. We do not depend on a sole supplier. Two of our wood pellet manufacturing facilities, Amite and Morehouse, are able to manufacture wood pellets at a capacity of 512,500 tonnes per year and our LaSalle plant, which was fully commissioned in 2018, is able to manufacture wood pellets at a nameplate capacity of 450,000 tonnes per year. Additionally, we are increasing capacity at our LaSalle, Amite and Morehouse facilities by 350,000 tonnes in aggregate over the next two years (which would represent a 23.7 per cent. increase on our current production capacity when the incremental capacity is fully commissioned) and we are also investing in three new satellite plants, which we anticipate will incur a small fraction of the equivalent cost of building a new pellet production plant of the same size and scale of each of those facilities. In addition, where liquidity permits, we purchase supplemental volumes of sustainable biomass on the spot market each year and additional volumes for delivery within 18 months of contract execution. The sustainable biomass pellets sourced by us are required to meet Drax Power Station’s fuel specification which, in turn, is designed to meet Drax Power Station’s operating requirements and certain sustainability criteria for the electricity produced from them to be eligible for ROCs and CfD support. The RO Scheme and CfD Regime require, among other things, that the wood pellets are sourced from sustainably managed sources. In addition to investment in the wood pellet manufacturing process, we also continue to seek to identify ways of investing in supporting infrastructure to improve the wider efficiency of the facilities. See “—Biomass _supply chain” below._ Supply contracts include penalty mechanisms if the fuel does not meet certain technical specifications. We also impose contractual obligations on our sustainable biomass pellet suppliers requiring them to satisfy the relevant sustainability criteria and conduct supplier audits using third party auditors. Alternatively, suppliers can evidence that they comply with the necessary sustainability requirements through Sustainable Biomass Program (“SBP”) certification, as SBP-compliant material has been benchmarked by Ofgem to fully meet the UK sustainability requirements. We encourage our suppliers to move towards SBP certification and, in 2019, we exceeded our target of sourcing 93 per cent. SBP-certified woody biomass fuel. We do not contract with counterparties who do not meet our biomass sustainability requirements. In 2019, we strengthened our leadership in the field of biomass sustainability by introducing a new Responsible Sourcing policy and establishing an Independent Advisory Board chaired by a former UK Chief Scientific Adviser and made up of scientists, academics and forestry experts to ensure our biomass sourcing meets the highest standards. Most sustainable biomass pellets used by us are sourced from outside the UK and priced in US dollars, Canadian dollars or euro. In 2019, 63 per cent. and 16 per cent. of our sustainable biomass supply was imported from the US and Canada, respectively (compared with 63 per cent. and 17 per cent. in 2018, respectively). The remainder, while still priced in US dollars, Canadian dollars or euro, was sourced primarily from various European countries and Brazil (1.5 per cent.). For further information with respect to foreign currency exchange exposures inherent within the cost of biomass, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition _and Results of Operations—Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Derivative Financial Instruments”. Biomass supply chain_ Biomass pellets are hygroscopic so readily absorb moisture from the environment. As a result, pellets must be kept dry and cannot be stored outside. These characteristics required us to develop and construct specialist storage and transport facilities. We import wood pellets into the UK via biomass import facilities at each of the ports of Tyne, Hull, Liverpool and Immingham, which together provide a combined total import capacity of more than 11 million tonnes per year, as well as operational flexibility and headroom in excess of our anticipated generation requirements. Each port contains specialist equipment for the discharge, storage and monitoring and subsequent loading of wood pellets to rail or road transport for onward haulage to Drax Power Station. Our total port storage capacity in the UK is approximately 460,000 tonnes, the majority of which is covered by long term contracts to at least 2027. In addition to storage at ports, we have approximately 200,000 tonnes of additional storage space available close to the ports and over 300,000 tonnes available at Drax Power Station. We also contract for additional short-term storage where necessary. Wood pellets are primarily transported from ports to Drax Power Station by rail. Rail paths between UK ports and Drax Power Station have been secured to meet our requirements and fluctuations in demand allowing 170 ----- over 130 train-loads of wood pellets per week to be delivered to Drax Power Station. We have, in partnership with industry specialists, developed a bespoke biomass rail wagon capable of carrying large volumes of biomass with capacity of almost one-third more than that of a coal rail wagon converted to transport biomass. Each wagon in our fleet of nine sets of wagons (comprising 225 individual wagons in total) has covers to ensure that the biomass pellets are kept dry during transit and have fully automated top and bottom doors, which allow loading and unloading to be carried out while the trains are in motion, increasing efficiency in the rail transport operation. At our UK and US port facilities and at Drax Power Station, the pellets are stored in technically advanced storage spaces with dust control infrastructure to reduce the risk of fire and explosions. The location of our Pellet Production segment assets allows us to leverage the benefits of multiple assets for operational efficiencies. Our three pellet manufacturing facilities and our Baton Rouge port facility are located within a 200-mile radius of each other, allowing for flexibility through the outage cycle at the manufacturing plants, sharing spares of key equipment across the facilities and the efficient use of human capital. The pellet manufacturing facilities also share logistics connections to our port facility at Baton Rouge and benefit from complementary fibre sourcing, allowing for the optimisation of supply between plants. We actively explore opportunities to increase the efficiency of, and therefore reduce the cost of, our selfsupply arrangements. For example, a new rail spur linking LaSalle to the regional network and our port facility at Baton Rouge was commissioned in May 2019 and, as part of a cooperative endeavour with the port of Greater Baton Rouge and the state of Louisiana, we are commissioning an upgraded chambering yard in 2020, that will allow 80car train sets to continue to operate from our LaSalle and Morehouse sites, further increasing our economies of scale in rail. In 2018, we also relocated our US head office from Atlanta, Georgia to Monroe, Louisiana, to be closer to our pellet production and port facilities, providing further efficiencies and operational savings. In addition, we entered into a co-location agreement with Hunt Forest Products, a sawmill operator, which led to the development of a sawmill next to our LaSalle site. This site commenced production in April 2019, providing greater access to low-cost sawmill residues used in pellet production, lower transportation costs and a reduction in the number of stages in the production process. In the first half of 2020, three new 40kt satellite plants were approved, and construction work on the first of these is set to begin this year. We are also undertaking a 350kt expansion of the Morehouse, Amite and LaSalle plants. We have a strategic target to selfsupply five million tonnes of sustainable biomass per annum by 2027, but an increase to this level requires us to acquire existing plants or expand organically. Beyond our internal production of biomass, we seek to contract with biomass producers in locations that maximise operational efficiencies and flexibility. While our own production has increased significantly, we have retained operational flexibility, which means we are able to take advantage of spot market opportunities and manage the flow of our biomass supply chain as part of the major planned biomass outage programme in the Generation segment. We are generally protected from short-term volatility in foreign exchange rates, due to having an active rolling five-year foreign exchange hedging programme with respect to the currencies in which fuel and carbon prices are denominated (predominantly US dollars, Canadian dollars and euro). _Coal_ The proportion of our generation from coal and coal derivatives has declined over the past five years as we converted four of Drax Power Station’s six generation units to run on sustainable biomass and acquired a diversified portfolio of hydro and gas assets. In 2019, 849,476 tonnes of coal and coal derivatives were delivered to Drax Power Station, a decline of approximately 90 per cent. since 2013. We plan to end commercial coal generation in March 2021, with formal closure of the coal units in September 2022, once we have fulfilled our existing Capacity Market obligations. We purchase coal primarily in the spot market to enable us to take advantage of favourable market conditions, if available, and do not routinely enter into forward contracts given our announced cessation of commercial generation in March 2021. With increasing levels of intermittent generation in the industry, we are continuing to identify opportunities to create value from our ability to flexibly operate our generation assets according to prevailing market conditions. This includes short-term power and balancing market activity and the provision of other System Support Services on both a short and long-term basis which are increasingly important for managing the UK electricity system. To capture value in this market, we continue to focus resources on optimising the availability and flexibility of all of our generation assets. 171 ----- We purchase coal from a range of sources with the objective of managing our commercial and credit exposure, environmental obligations such as the IED, the Best Available Techniques Reference document for Large Combustion Plants and diversity of supply. _Gas_ Drax’s generation portfolio includes four CCGT power stations at Damhead Creek in Kent (805MW), Shoreham in West Sussex (420MW), Rye House in Hertfordshire (715MW) and Blackburn Mill in Lancashire (60MW), contributing a total of 2GW to our total generation capacity. In 2019, approximately 229 million therms of gas was burned for electricity generation at our CCGT power stations at Damhead Creek, Rye House, Shoreham and Blackburn Mill. We ordinarily purchase gas around the time we sell the electricity output of a gas station and purchase associated emissions allowances, thus locking in the “clean spark spread”, which is the difference between the wholesale electricity price and the cost of gas and carbon, including emission allowances under the EU ETS and Carbon Price Support and exchange rate differences. The cost of gas and emissions allowances is dependent on market prices at the time the purchases are secured, typically at the same time the power sales take place. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Significant Factors _Affecting Results of Operations—Bark Spread, Clean Spark Spread, Dark Green Spread and Hydro Power”._ In addition to providing baseload and peak generation, all our CCGT assets (other than Blackburn Mill, which is connected directly to the Distribution System and does not deliver electricity to the Transmission System) are able to provide System Support Services. Additionally, we are assessing the hydrogen readiness of our new CCGT plant as this technology and associated infrastructure progress. _Electricity and ROC sales and trading strategy_ Electricity generated is sold directly to the wholesale market and indirectly through our Customers segment. In the six months ended June 2020 and six months ended June 2019, the Generation segment derived revenues of £1,238.8 million and £1,254.1 million respectively, from electricity sales. Inter-segment sales from the Generation segment to the Customers segment accounted for £1,115.0 million, or 45.0 per cent., and £1,020.4 million, or 50.9 per cent., of the revenue generated from electricity sales in the first half of 2020 and 2019, respectively. In the wholesale market, the majority of our revenues from the sale of electricity and ROCs are derived from sales to large energy suppliers and financial institutions, many of whom have more robust credit profiles than smaller independent suppliers. We have robust credit policies in place to limit the amount of concentration risk we have with any particular counterparty (noting that the counterparty’s appetite to trade with us is itself based on its own assessment of our credit profile) and sales to the Customers segment (as opposed to third parties) reduce the Generation segment’s exposure to third parties by spreading exposure across a wider customer base. We derived revenues of £575.7 million in 2019 and £555.8 million in 2018 from one individual customer that represented 12.2 and 13.1 per cent of total consolidated revenue respectively for the period. These revenues arose in the Generation segment. Our margin from wholesale electricity generation is only delivered, subject to underlying credit exposure, when the underlying electricity generated by our generation facilities is sold (and, where applicable, the associated subsidy payment is earned) either on the wholesale markets or through our Customers segment. This electricity will often be sold on a forward basis, although we retain flexibility to make electricity sales based on the attractiveness  of  pricing,  liquidity  and  collateral/credit  efficiency.  For  further  information,  see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Significant Factors _Affecting Results of Operations—Bark Spread, Clean Spark Spread, Dark Green Spread and Hydro Power”._ The price of electricity is affected by fluctuations in both supply and demand, which in turn are affected by, among other things, weather conditions (particularly the output of wind and solar generation assets) and fluctuations in the market price of other commodities. To optimise our electricity trading, we utilise all three sub-markets of the wholesale electricity market: (i) the long-term forward market, (ii) the short-term market (or spot market), and (iii) the real-time market (the Balancing Mechanism). For further information, see “Industry Overview— _Wholesale—Overview of the wholesale electricity market”. Trading sustainable biomass units_ Our strategy for trading our sustainable biomass units seeks to mitigate the volumetric and pricing risks associated with the nascent third party biomass supply market by entering into a long-term fuel hedge on 172 ----- sustainable biomass fuel costs. Sustainable biomass is predominantly acquired from our Pellet Production segment or on long-term contracts with third party suppliers and the basis risk inherent in that contract (for example, fluctuations in currency arising due to the purchase of volumes in US dollars and/or fluctuations in fuel or freight costs on transporting the sustainable biomass to the UK) is hedged to the extent we are able to do so, taking into account market availability. Fibre costs are generally unhedged due to the lack of available hedging products; however, wherever possible, costs are capped in fibre contracts. The support provided by ROCs and our CfD is indexed to UK RPI and UK CPI, respectively, and so provides a partial hedge against inflation. For our three generation units that were converted to biomass under the RO Scheme, the ROCs arising from the sustainable biomass generation are either utilised by the Customers segment or sold to third parties (on a forward basis where liquidity and pricing permit). We optimise our ROC assets to manage our day-to-day working capital position. Where we choose to sell ROCs to accelerate cash flows, we may choose to purchase ROCs at a later date for submission by our Customers segment, ultimately leading to a similar offsetting charge in cost of sales. ROCs may also be purchased from the market to be utilised by the Customers segment. For further information on the RO Scheme and ROCs, see “Industry Overview—UK Clean Energy Legislation— Operation of _the Renewables Obligation”._ For the generation unit that was converted to biomass and benefits from our CfD, our trading strategy aims to ensure that the price achieved is directionally aligned to the CfD reference price. The mechanics of the CfD provide a quasi-hedge against fluctuations in the long-term electricity price. The Generation segment sells a significant proportion of its ROCs to our Customers segment. In the ROC compliance period from 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020, approximately 6.6 million ROCs were sold to our Customers segment compared to approximately 9.5 million ROCs earned by our Generation segment. _Trading gas units_ Our strategy for trading our gas units is focused on obtaining attractive clean spark spreads when available and having the units available to capture value from providing System Support Services and from the Balancing Mechanism. The generation capacity of the gas generation units is generally sold in mid-term and short-term markets. For further information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and _Results of Operations—Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Bark Spread, Clean Spark Spread, Dark Green Spread and Hydro Power”._ Our CCGT plant in Blackburn Mill is connected directly to the Distribution System, and therefore qualifies for “embedded benefits” (financial benefits available to smaller-scale power stations as a result of their direct connection to the Distribution System). _Trading hydro power plants_ Our strategy for trading our hydro power plants is to sell electricity based on an average forecast of rainfall through the year. These sales will then be re-profiled in the short-term markets. The running profile will be dependent on market prices, rainfall, storage capability and river conditions, based on updated and more accurate forecast data. The Lanark power plant receives regulatory support from the RO Scheme in respect of its full generating capacity, and the Galloway run-of-river power station receives regulatory support from the RO Scheme with respect to approximately 28MW of its 109MW generating capacity. Our strategy for trading ROCs generated by these facilities is substantially the same as that used for ROCs generated by our biomass units at Drax Power Station, as described under “—Trading ROCs”. Our hydro power plants are connected directly to the Distribution System, and therefore qualify for embedded benefits. _Trading pumped storage units_ Our Cruachan pumped storage power plant receives income from providing a number of System Support Services as well as peak power generation. The asset primarily operates in the short-term markets (including the Balancing Mechanism) with the aim of locking in spreads between exports onto the grid and importing energy to pump water back into the reservoir. _Trading coal units_ We aim to make our coal units available to capture value from providing System Support Services and from the Balancing Mechanism. We have entered into forward sales in respect of all of the power (and bought all of 173 ----- the carbon) associated with our coal stock and do not intend to make any further purchases of coal. Coal units are increasingly unprofitable and as such we have announced that we will cease commercial generation in March 2021.

Daldowie biomass-from-waste facility_ We own and operate a biomass-from-waste facility located in Daldowie, Scotland. Our Daldowie facility has the capacity to produce approximately 50,000 tonnes of dry, low-odour pellets annually and benefits from a firm offtake agreement that extends to 2026. _Trading ROCs_ Three of our sustainable biomass-fired generation units and our Lanark and Galloway run-of-river power plants receive support under the RO Scheme and Drax Power Station (other than the unit receiving support under the CfD Regime) is accredited by Ofgem as a qualifying renewable plant. The ROCs issued by Ofgem to Drax Power Station and the run-of-river power plants at Lanark and Galloway are held electronically on Ofgem’s registry and are transferred to purchaser registry accounts when sales are completed. We are eligible to receive ROCs in respect of our generation from sustainable biomass in our first, second and fourth converted generation units at Drax Power Station, in respect of our generation at the Lanark runof-river power plant and in respect of approximately 28MW of the Galloway run-of-river power plant’s 109MW of capacity, in each case until 2027, at which point we will lose support under this regime. We receive one ROC per MWh of electricity generated from those units that are supported by the RO Scheme. In July 2018, the Renewables Obligation (Amendment) Order 2018 came into force, establishing an annual ROC cap at the power station level across all RO accredited units equal to DBEIS’s estimate of the number of ROCs to be received by each grandfathered biomass-fired unit (the first and second converted units at Drax Power Station) plus 125,000 ROCs for each non-grandfathered unit (the fourth converted unit at Drax Power Station). Though we may not always reach the annual station-level ROC cap, the conversion of this fourth generation unit to biomass therefore gives us the flexibility to optimise our generation across all RO-accredited units at Drax Power Station in a way that maximises the number of ROCs we receive within the aggregate cap providing valuable operating redundancy. For example if output from either of the first two converted units at Drax Power Station were to be lower than DBEIS’s estimated output, Drax could then increase the generation under the fourth converted unit in excess of 125,000 MWh to make up the shortfall. For further information on ROCs, see “Industry Overview— _UK clean energy legislation—Operation of the Renewables Obligation”. During the compliance period between 1_ April 2019 and 31 March 2020, Drax Power Station received more ROCs than any other single generation site in the UK. Historically, we sold the majority of our ROCs to third party electricity suppliers. However, we now sell a significant proportion of our ROCs to our Customers segment. Where we choose to sell ROCs to accelerate cash flows, we may choose to purchase ROCs at a later date for submission by our Customers segment ultimately leading to a similar offsetting charge in cost of sales. For the year ended 31 December 2019, following these actions, there was a similar value in revenue and cost of sales for ROC sales and purchases. _System Support Services and Capacity Market payments_ In the Generation segment, we also derive revenues from System Support Services, which amounted to £66.1 million, £60.7 million, £120.0 million and £56.9 million for the six months ended 30 June 2020 and 2019 and the years ended 31 December 2019 and 2018, respectively. There are a range of System Support Services contracted directly with the System Operator (other than the Balancing Mechanism). The type, length and value of these System Support Services will depend on the requirements of the System Operator, but we expect that these services will become increasingly important due to the evolving generation mix with an increase in intermittent generation systems such as wind and solar power and a reduction in flexible capacity. Our portfolio of dispatchable and flexible assets allows us to capture value by supporting the System Operator in managing the impact of the UK’s transition to a low-carbon economy, as the share of wind and solar generation increases. We routinely participate in the UK Capacity Market. In Capacity Market auctions, participants bid for Capacity Market agreements under which they commit to generate at times of system stress. Under a Capacity Market agreement, a generator is entitled to fixed monthly payments in exchange for a commitment to deliver energy during a system stress event, which occurs when the System Operator has to resort to emergency actions 174 ----- in order to balance supply. These fixed payments provide guaranteed revenue in exchange for a commitment to deliver energy during a system stress event, which occurs when the System Operator has to resort to emergency actions in order to balance supply. We hold a number of Capacity Market agreements for each of our CCGT power stations, the Cruachan pumped storage plant, the Galloway run-of-river power plant and our two coal-fired units at Drax Power Station providing revenues out to 2024 (or, in the case of our coal units and Blackburn Power Station, 2022). Following the T-4 Capacity Market Auction held in March 2020, we have secured agreements to provide a total of 2,562MW of capacity from our Damhead Creek, Rye House and Shoreham CCGT assets, the Cruachan pumped storage plant and the Galloway run-of-river power plant in the year commencing 1 October 2024. We plan to participate in future Capacity Market auctions, based on the capacity of our CCGT power stations, the Cruachan pumped storage power plant and the Galloway run-of-river power plant, and we have prequalified existing assets to participate in the T-4 Capacity Market Auction due to take place in January 2021; however, we will only participate in the auction and accept capacity market agreements where we consider it profitable to do so. For further information on the Capacity Market, see “Industry Overview—Overview of Electricity Market Reform— _Capacity Market” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—The Capacity Market in the UK is currently suspended and its future is uncertain”._ For further information on the Capacity Market, see “Industry Overview—Overview of Electricity Market _Reform—Capacity Market”. Flexible generation development projects_ We are developing a pipeline of projects for flexible and dispatchable generation that will, if developed, support the UK electricity system and allow for further development and growth of intermittent renewable technologies. Our four OCGT development projects will, if any is fully developed, provide us with further gas-fired generation capabilities. Each plant is expected to be able to provide 299MW of fast, flexible natural gas generation to support the system at times of peak demand, and are able to fire up from a cold start and produce electricity in minutes rather than hours. This rapid cold start capability can be used to provide quick response flexible generation to support the electricity system, and to provide System Support Services. On 4 October 2019, the Government granted us a DCO to repower the retiring coal-fired generation capacity (approximately 1.3GW) at Drax Power Station with up to 3.6GW of natural gas generation capacity. The decision of the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy to grant the DCO now faces judicial review with the outcome expected later this year or early next year. We do not intend to participate in any future Capacity Market auctions with respect to these assets until the outcome of such judicial review is known. For further information on the Capacity Market, see “Industry Overview—Overview of Electricity Market Reform— _Capacity Market”._ Our Damhead Creek site benefits from an option for the development of a second CCGT asset, Damhead Creek II, which, if developed, would provide additional natural gas generation optionality for us, alongside our existing coal-to-gas repowering discussed above and OCGT projects. This project would give us an additional 1.8GW of flexible and reliable generation. The development of all projects remain subject to a positive investment decision and appropriate support through the Capacity Market.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

74_1,Offerings 2020.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.24,Pellet Production,521.24.1,,"We own and operate three wood pellet manufacturing facilities and a port export facility in the US which support Drax Power Station’s demand for high quality, sustainable biomass. In the first half of 2020, our wood pellet facilities produced approximately 753,000 tonnes of sustainable biomass representing 19 per cent. of our six months ended 30 June 2020 requirement for generation from sustainable biomass, compared to production of approximately 646,000 tonnes in the first half of 2019. This reflects the operation of the facilities at their nameplate capacity of 1,475,000 tonnes per annum for the first half of 2020. We continuously seek to improve our cost profile through productivity gains, carefully managed raw fibre costs and increased asset utilisation. We aim to increase the share of internally sourced pellets to five million tonnes per annum by 2027. At present, the US operations principally seek to optimise supply chain and logistics operations of the Generation segment and ensure the timely delivery of sustainable biomass fuel to Drax Power Station. The headquarters of the Pellet Production segment is located in Monroe, Louisiana. The operations of the Pellet Production segment are located 175 ----- primarily in the US Gulf region, geographically close to both large and growing sustainably managed forests and deep-water ports to optimise the transportation of both feedstock and biomass pellets within the US and ultimately across the Atlantic Ocean to Drax Power Station. Our three wood pellet manufacturing facilities are all within a 200-mile radius, allowing them to benefit from operational and logistical efficiencies. Our original two pellet manufacturing facilities, Amite and Morehouse, are located near Bastrop, Louisiana and Gloster, Mississippi, and have a combined annual capacity of 1,025,000 tonnes, which reflects an aggregate increase of 150,000 tonnes of production capacity at the facilities in 2017. In April 2017, we successfully completed the acquisition of our LaSalle BioEnergy facility near Urania, Louisiana. This facility has an annual nameplate capacity of 450,000 tonnes and was fully commissioned in 2018. In furtherance of our aim to increase our selfsupply capacity, we are increasing production capacity at our LaSalle, Amite and Morehouse facilities over the next two years and also are developing three new satellite plants in the US Gulf which will utilise sawmill residues and leverage our existing US Gulf infrastructure to produce, we believe, biomass at around 20% below the current cost of production. We expect the expansion of our existing pellet production facilities and our investment in these three new satellite pellet plans will provide an additional nameplate capacity of approximately 350,000 tonnes per annum and 120,000 tonnes per annum, respectively, by early 2022. We expect the remaining capacity to be produced through further development of existing sites, new development projects and a wider fuel envelope at Drax Power Station. These activities will assist in our aim of reducing the cost of biomass from around £75/MWh today to approximately £50/MWh by 2027, thereby enabling Drax Power Station to generate profitably without subsidy. This expansion could also potentially service wider wood pellet demand in Europe, North America and Asia. Through these cost reduction initiatives outlined above, we aim to deliver approximately half of that cost reduction by 2022 for our existing pellet business. Looking forward we are assessing fuel procurement from a broader range of geographies and considering the development of further low-cost satellite plants which would be able to use our existing infrastructure in the US to produce low-cost sustainable wood pellets. We believe that such plants could add up to 500,000 tonnes of additional capacity per annum. Wood pellets are produced from sustainably sourced biomass in the form of primary sources such as thinnings, tops and harvesting residues sourced from the surrounding forests or secondary sources such as wood chips, shavings or sawdust sourced from other wood-based manufacturing facilities. All our wood pellet manufacturing facilities  are  certified  under  the  Sustainable  Biomass  Program,  an  industry  standard, demonstrating that biomass is legally and sustainably sourced. Although this certification is an industry standard, the facilities could still fulfil the sustainability specifications of the RO and CfD Schemes without this certification if they meet certain other requirements. Procurement of raw materials is the main driver of costs in our Pellet Production segment. The fibre is sourced from a range of suppliers local to the manufacturing facilities (“Fibre Basket”), with a range of contract tenors. The plants are sited within Fibre Baskets with well-established commercial forestry operations, which principally service the construction and manufacturing markets and provide a large amount of the lower-value residue material typically used for sustainable wood pellets. A co-location agreement with Hunt Forest Products led to the development of a sawmill next to our LaSalle site, which commenced production in April 2019, providing greater access to low-cost sawmill residues, lower transportation costs and a reduction in the number of stages in the production process. Wood pellets are transported by road and rail from our manufacturing facilities to our own 2.4 million tonne per annum port export facility located at Baton Rouge, Louisiana. This export facility consists of port-side storage and loading capabilities and includes two 40,000 tonne storage domes, which can store pellets, arriving by road or rail, from our manufacturing facilities and from third party suppliers. Our Baton Rouge facility dispatched ships to the UK carrying approximately 1.54 million tonnes of pellets in 2019. A new rail spur linking LaSalle to the regional rail network and this port facility was commissioned in February 2019. At the port of Baton Rouge, as part of a cooperative endeavour with the port of Greater Baton Rouge and the state of Louisiana, we are commissioning an upgraded chambering yard in 2020 that will allow 80-car train sets to continue to operate from our LaSalle and Morehouse sites, further increasing our economies of scale in rail.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654
74_1,Offerings 2020.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.25,Customers,521.25.1,,"Our Customers segment is active in the markets for electricity and gas supply through Haven Power (electricity) and Opus (electricity and gas) and is the largest supplier of renewable electricity to businesses in the UK as of 31 December 2019, supplying over 281,500 electricity and gas meters as of 31 December 2019. In 2019, the Customers segment had revenues of £2,269.1 million compared to £2,242.4 million in 2018 and Adjusted EBITDA of £17.4 million in 2019, representing approximately four per cent. of the Group’s Adjusted 176 ----- EBITDA for 2019. In the first half of 2020, our Customers segment reported a loss at an Adjusted EBITDA level of £37 million. This reflected the significant reduction in demand due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the costs associated with exiting hedged positions in the context of falling market prices, the increase in costs of selling pre-contracted power and gas back into the market and the increased risk of business failure and bad debt (principally impacting the SME market). We expect Adjusted EBITDA to continue to be derived from nonmerchant sources. Our Customers segment supplied approximately 18.9TWh to customers in 2019, comprising approximately 15.9TWh of electricity and 3.0TWh of gas, and had a market share in the non-domestic electricity supply sector of 8 per cent. by volume of supply as at 30 June 2020. Our Customers segment provides us with a direct route to market for much of the electricity we generate and the ROCs we produce, and a more diversified counterparty base than selling directly in the wholesale market, with less concentrated counterparty credit risk. The B2B market remains competitive with over 30 active suppliers across the UK market as of 31 October 2019. Our Haven and Opus businesses offer customer-centric electricity, gas and renewable products and services, and allow customers to optimise their energy use and lower costs through the provision of insight and digitisation tools, for example by leveraging data from installed smart meters. At the smaller microbusiness-end of the market, which is closer in proximity to the domestic market, most of our customers are on price pass- through tariffs where variable non-energy costs are passed through to customers. Many of our larger customers are signed up to flexible contracts where the customer either decides when to fix the price of their electricity at a given point in time or leaves it to vary according to market prices on a day or month ahead basis. During 2019, Haven Power and Opus Energy were consolidated into a single operating structure with a single management team, driving effective market segmentation and operational efficiencies. _Haven Power_ Haven Power focuses on providing businesses with 100 per cent. renewable electricity supply contracts from a range of simple, flexible and tailored contracts designed to meet businesses’ electricity requirements, backed by high standards of customer service. Haven Power originally operated solely in the non-domestic SME sector, but now principally supplies customers in the I&C sector. Haven Power acquires a significant proportion of its electricity from within the Group, enabling Haven Power to contract for electricity on a forward basis in a market where independent suppliers can face liquidity issues in the absence of sole-offtake agreements. In the SME sector, Haven Power offers predominantly fixed price contracts with diverse pricing to meet the needs and risk profile of its SME customer base. In the I&C sector, Haven Power offers a number of more complex flexible products which allow the customer to choose when to lock-in their electricity prices. Customers using such products may have the ability to fix prices for electricity for up to five years in advance or to purchase their electricity at the prevailing market rates for the day or month ahead. The length of the contracts generally varies from 12 to 60 months. In 2019, United Utilities became Haven Power’s first customer to sign up to its “Asset Flex” project. Under these arrangements, customers provide “demand side response” whereby financial incentives are received by customers for the reduction in the use of non-essential equipment at times of peak demand, assisted by Haven Power technology. In 2019, SES Water, a Haven Power customer, became the first customer to sign up to an electric vehicle offer from Drax comprising charging infrastructure and operation, vehicle telematics and vehicle leasing. _Opus_ Opus is a UK supplier of electricity and gas with a focus on the SME market. Opus procures the electricity and gas it supplies to its customers from within the Group, and from a large number of small electricity generators with whom it contracts at profitable levels compared to wholesale rates. Purchasing predominantly within the Group creates a credit-efficient route to market for the electricity and ROCs generated in the Generation segment. In the renewable electricity purchase agreement sector, Opus offers one- to three-year contracts to generators to purchase electricity from them and in 2019, this amounted to 1.2GWh of renewable energy generated from approximately 2,200 generators. These contracts include both fixed-price arrangements and more flexible, bespoke arrangements for larger generators. Our Customers segment has an active network of TPIs, which routinely introduce new customers to suppliers. The majority of our customers in the Customer segment are obtained through a network of TPIs. See 177 ----- “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Our reliance on TPIs and termination of relations _with them might have an adverse impact on our reputation and operations.”_ Opus offers business customers electricity and gas supply contracts and renewable electricity purchase agreements on standard terms. In the SME sector, Opus offers gas and electricity contracts on a diverse price basis to suit its customers’ risk profiles. The terms of these products range from one to four years and are designed to pass on third party charges to customers. In the corporate sector, Opus offers electricity on a fixed and flexible contract basis on terms of up to three years. Corporate gas customers are offered fixed-price products only.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

Since 2003, we have deepened our understanding of biomass combustion chemistry by investing significant resources in scientific and technological research aimed at increasing the usable range of sustainable biomass fuels in response to the prospective demand for such fuels. This has led to, among other things, a patented mitigant system 178 ----- which injects pulverised fuel ash (which is a by-product of coal combustion and therefore readily available) at a specific point in the combustion zone to reduce corrosion in the boilers when operating on biomass. 179 ----- We take a long-term view to our business and operating environment, seeking to identify options which can deliver value accretive growth in the future. To that end, we continue to look for opportunities through research and innovation to identify further sources of value from our core business and have a dedicated innovation team specifically tasked with identifying long-term growth opportunities for the Group that allow us to deliver on our strategy and achieve our purpose. While we have a significant number of innovation workstreams ongoing at any one time, the innovation team’s current focus is principally on reducing the cost of generating electricity from biomass, thereby aiming to deliver increased profitability in the short and medium term and enable Drax Power Station to generate profitably from sustainable biomass without subsidy beyond 2027. These projects include reviewing the expansion of the fuel envelope at Drax Power Station to include alternative sources of sustainable biomass such as woodchips, bagasse and nutshells. In support of our BECCS aims, we are a member of the Zero Carbon Humber consortium of companies, a partnership to build the world’s first zero-carbon industrial cluster and decarbonise the North of England. More widely, the innovation team is looking at a range of innovative new technologies to improve the efficiency of all aspects of our business, most notably, looking at a range of technology options to reduce the cost of our sustainable biomass pellets from their current price to £50MWh by 2027. This is supported by the work that our viable fuels team are doing to expand our biomass envelope, evaluate and test new biomass feedstocks and optimise the geographical scope of our fuel procurement.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654
74_1,Offerings 2020.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.29,Environment,521.29.1,,"_Environmental performance of Drax Power Station_ EU environmental legislation (which continues to apply in the UK pursuant to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended), notably the IED, imposes limits on, among other things, emissions of SO2 and NOx from our generation units. Effective January 2016, the IED sets an emissions limit on the amount of NOx, SO2 and particulate matter that we can emit from Drax Power Station and Damhead Creek. We must ensure that our coal and biomass units operate within this limit. Drax Power Station is subject to short-term (24-hourly and monthly) emission limit values for SO2, NOx and particulate matter. These limits reflect achievable emissions rates from plants such as Drax Power Station, and Drax Power Station has been, and expects to remain, materially compliant with them. Additionally, we are focused on meeting the requirements of the Best Available Techniques Reference document for Large Combustion Plants developed under the IED that will further reduce air emission limits when it enters into force no later than mid-2021. The FGD system is designed to remove approximately 90 per cent. of SO2 emissions from the coal generating units, enabling Drax Power Station to operate within the SO2 emissions restrictions of the IED and to efficiently burn a mixture of fuels, including coal and petroleum coke, in a manner that satisfies environmental requirements. Sustainable biomass wood pellets produce minimal levels of sulphur such that the FGD system has not been utilised on the units that have transitioned from coal to biomass at Drax Power Stations. NOx emissions are reduced through the boosted over-fire air technology that is fitted on the boilers, allowing Drax Power Station to operate within the NOx restrictions of the IED. In addition, five of Drax Power Station’s six generation units have been fitted with selective non-catalytic reduction technology. The installation of this new equipment, together with the increased use of sustainable biomass and low-NOx coal as well as lower electricity output, contributed to a 81 per cent. reduction in NOx emissions from Drax Power Station in 2019 compared to 2015. By-products of the coal-combustion and FGD operations such as ash and gypsum are sold to the construction industry, which both reduces disposal costs and creates revenue. Ash can also be used as mitigant to be fed into Drax Power Station’s boilers along with biomass to reduce corrosion and slagging. For further information, see “Industry Overview—Electricity Market: regulatory context—Capacity _constraints”. Environmental performance and compliance_ During 2019, we continued to reduce our carbon footprint, having completed the conversion of our fourth generation unit to burn sustainable biomass in August 2018. Of the 17.3TWh we generated in 2019, approximately 78 per cent. was generated from burning sustainable biomass in line with the SBP contributing to an almost 40% reduction in tonnes of capacity per GWh of power generated. 180 ----- We strive towards reducing our impact on the environment and regard compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements as the minimum level of achievement. Fossil fuel-derived CO2 emissions from Drax Power Station fell from 22.7 million tonnes in 2012 to 0.7 million tonnes in 2019. Across our wider generation business, fossil fuel-derived CO2 emissions have reduced by more than 85 per cent. since 2012. We are required to disclose emissions from biologically sequestered carbon, which includes emissions released through burning sustainable biomass to generate electricity (approximately 12.27 million tonnes in 2019 and 12.47 million tonnes in 2018). This decrease in emissions from biologically sequestered carbon is due to our reduction in biomass-fired generation in 2019. Environmental compliance at our generation sites in the UK is managed through an environmental management system that is externally certified to the international standard ISO 14001. It is audited twice every year. There have been no material breaches of our environmental consents in the last three years. Environmental compliance at our hydro assets is managed through the Controlled Activities Regulations 2011, commonly referred to as CAR. For further information on CAR, see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our _Business and Industry—Our cost of compliance with environmental laws and regulations, as well as costs to address any environmental liabilities arising from our operating activities, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations”._",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

The Agreed Security Principles embody a recognition that there may be certain practical and legal difficulties in obtaining effective Guarantees and Security from members of the DGHL Group in every jurisdiction in which DGHL and its Restricted Subsidiaries are located. Subject as referred to in the third paragraph below, Note Guarantees will not be given and Security Interests shall not be created or perfected to the extent that: (1) it would result in a breach of general statutory limitations, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, “thin capitalisation”, “earnings stripping”, “controlled foreign corporation”, transfer pricing, capital maintenance, retention of title claims and similar principles, laws or regulations, _provided_ that DGHL will use reasonable endeavours to (a) assist in demonstrating that adequate corporate benefit accrues to each relevant Guarantor and (b) complete any whitewash or similar procedure required under any relevant financial assistance laws; (2) the provision and/or perfection of such Note Guarantees or Security Interests would result in costs (including interest deductability, stamp duty, notarisation or registration fees) to the DGHL Group or a significant tax disadvantage that, in either case, would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders of the Notes; (3) such assets are subject to third party arrangements which are permitted by the Indenture and which prevent those assets from being charged (or assets which, if charged, would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations of the DGHL Group in respect of those assets or require any member of the DGHL Group to take any action materially adverse to the interests of the DGHL Group or any member thereof). Such assets will be excluded 231 ----- from any relevant Security Document (other than from any floating charge granted pursuant to a Security Document governed by English law), provided that reasonable endeavours to obtain consent to charging any such assets shall be used by the relevant Guarantor if the facility agent under the Senior Facilities Agreement determines the relevant asset to be material and (taking into account DGHL’s view on any likely impact on commercial relationships with third parties) reasonably requests, consistent with current and customary market practice in the relevant jurisdiction, DGHL to do so, and _provided further, that such requirement to use reasonable endeavours shall not apply:_ (a) in respect of any asset owned or acquired by the Issuer or any Guarantor that is subject to a Security Interest securing a purchase money, Project Finance Indebtedness, capital or finance lease obligation or Acquired Indebtedness permitted to be incurred pursuant to the Indenture (or a refinancing of any of the foregoing) if the contract or other agreement in which such Security Interest is granted (or the documentation providing for such purchase money, project financing, capital or finance lease obligation or Acquired Indebtedness or such refinancing) prohibits or restricts the creation of any other Security Interest on such assets (including if the grant of any other Security Interest would constitute a breach or default under, result in the termination of, or give rise to a right on the part of any party thereto to terminate or materially modify, such contract or agreement or such documentation); or (b) in the case of any capital stock of any Person that is not a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary, if such Security Interest is prohibited or restricted (including if the grant of a Security Interest would constitute a breach or default under, result in the termination of, or give rise to a right on the part of any party thereto to terminate or materially modify, any such document, contract or other agreement) by any organisational or governance documents of such Person, any applicable shareholder or similar agreement or any contract or other agreement governing Indebtedness of such Person; or (4)  it is not within the legal capacity of the relevant member of the DGHL Group to give the Note Guarantee or enter into the Security Document or it would conflict with the fiduciary duties of the Issuer’s or Guarantor’s directors or officers and/or contravene any legal or regulatory prohibition or could reasonably be expected to result in personal or criminal liability on the part of any director or officer provided that the relevant Issuer or Guarantor shall use reasonable endeavours to overcome any such obstacle. No Note Guarantee, indemnity or Security Interest will be required to be provided by (i) any Unrestricted Subsidiary, (ii) any Receivables Subsidiary, or (iii) any Project Finance Subsidiary. Where appropriate to overcome any of the matters referred to the first paragraph above, the obligations arising under Note Guarantees and the obligations secured under a Security Interest will be limited: (1) to avoid any breach of corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, “thin capitalisation”, “earnings stripping”, “controlled foreign corporation”, transfer pricing, capital maintenance, retention of title claims and similar principles, rules or the laws or regulations (or analogous restrictions) of any applicable jurisdiction; and (2) to avoid any risk to officers of the relevant member of the DGHL Group that is granting a Lien of contravention of their fiduciary duties and/or civil or criminal or personal liability. The following factors will apply when determining the extent of the Note Guarantees and the Liens to be provided: (1) the maximum amount guaranteed or secured may be limited to minimise stamp duty, notarisation, registration or other applicable fees, taxes and duties where the benefit to the Holders of the Notes of increasing the guaranteed or secured amount is disproportionate to the level of such fee, taxes and duties; (2) each Note Guarantee will be an upstream, cross-stream and downstream guarantee and each Note Guarantee and Lien will be for all liabilities of the Issuer and Guarantors under the Notes and the Indenture in accordance with, and subject to, the requirements of each relevant jurisdiction; (3) where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of granting Liens over the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such Lien, Liens will be granted over the material assets only; 232 ----- (4) Liens will be taken in respect of all insurance policies of the Issuer and the Guarantors (other than third party insurance, public liability insurance, director’s and officer’s insurance and insurance of Guarantors incorporated or organised under the laws of Delaware or any other U.S. state or territory), provided that such insurance policy does not prohibit such Lien to be so granted and provided further_ that no perfection of Liens or notification to any third party shall be required in respect of insurance policies until the Notes have been accelerated as set out under “—Events of Default”; (5) where Liens are granted over an insurance policy, no loss payee or other endorsement shall be made on the insurance policy; (6) Liens will be granted over all intellectual property of the Issuer and the Guarantors, provided that no Lien shall be granted over any intellectual property which cannot be secured under the terms of the relevant licensing agreement and _provided further_ that no perfection or registration of Liens or notification to any third party shall be required in respect of intellectual property until the Notes have been accelerated as set out under “—Events of Default”; (7) where the Issuer or a Guarantor grants Liens over its intellectual property it shall be free to deal with those assets in the course of its business (including, without limitation, allowing its intellectual property to lapse if no longer material to its business); (8) Liens will be granted over all real estate owned by the Issuer or a Guarantor, provided that perfection or registration of any Lien over real estate prior to the Lien becoming enforceable will only be required in respect of real estate which is material to the DGHL Group (taken as a whole) and no perfection or registration will be required in respect of leasehold property. Other than where real property of the Issuer or a Guarantor is secured by a floating charge or other similar all-asset security, Liens need only be granted over after-acquired real property where the value of such property is in excess of £2.5 million (unless the aggregate value of after-acquired property not secured would exceed £5.0 million). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Liens will be granted over real estate in the United States; (9) where the Issuer or a Guarantor grants Liens over real estate, there will be no obligation to investigate title, provide surveys or other insurance or environmental due diligence; (10)  Liens will be taken in respect of contracts of the Issuer or a Guarantor, provided that no Lien will be granted over any contract which cannot be secured under the terms of the relevant contract and provided _further that no perfection of Liens or assignment by way of security or notification to any third party_ shall be required in respect of contracts until the Notes have been accelerated as set out under “—Events _of Default”;_ (11) Liens shall be granted over all intercompany and trade receivables, provided that no Lien will be granted over any such receivables which cannot be secured under the terms of the relevant contract and _provided further that no Lien will be required to be granted or perfected with respect to Receivables_ Assets that are subject to a Permitted Lien, and _provided further_ that no perfection of Liens or assignment by way of security or notification to any third party in respect of such receivables shall be required until the Notes have been accelerated as set out under “—Events of Default”;

Such Change in Tax Law must be formally announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Tax Jurisdiction became a Relevant Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date).

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered; and (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer. If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) will, at the cost of the Issuer, promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. For so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notices relating to the Change of Control Offer in a daily newspaper with general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notices on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu). Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture will not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require the Issuer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalisation or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire DGHL or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer with respect to the Notes upon a Change of Control or repurchase any Notes as described under this heading “Change of Control” if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer for the Notes in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (2) a notice of redemption in respect of the Notes has been given in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer with respect to any Notes may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control if a definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the U.S. Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to 244 ----- this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance. The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain events that constitute a Change of Control would require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the ESG Facility Agreement, the Private Placement Agreement, the Term Facilities Agreement, the 2022 Indenture and the 2025 Indenture. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under the Senior Facilities Agreement and require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under such agreement may not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture. Future Indebtedness of DGHL or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources, including the financial resources of DGHL and its Restricted Subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and Our Capital _Structure—The Issuer may not be able to finance a change of control offer”._ The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition, in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of DGHL and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of DGHL and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that DGHL or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for the periods presented, except as may otherwise be described in such information; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) of the first paragraph of this covenant or the third paragraph of this covenant may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods.

Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Issuer and DGHL will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs. The Trustee (i) does not have any duty to review any financial statements and/or reports provided to it pursuant to this “Reports” covenant, (ii) is not considered to have notice of the contents of such financial statements and/or reports, or a default or Event of Default based on such contents, and (iii) does not have a duty to verify the accuracy of such financial statements and/or reports.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

The Global Notes will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common depositary and registered in the name of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream. Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that hold interests through such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositaries. Except under the limited circumstances described below, Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive certificated form. Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be done only through, records maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be issued only in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The laws of some jurisdictions may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive certificated form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not have the Notes registered in their name, will not have received physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or “holders” of Notes for any purpose (other than for certain tax purposes). So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or its nominee, will be considered the sole holder of the Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. Accordingly, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders under the Indenture. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent and the Paying Agent, or any of their respective agents will have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records relating to the Book- Entry Interests.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

The Issuer understands that, under the existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions), by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate in accordance with their operational procedures; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000 principal amount may be redeemed in part.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

Neither us, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent, the Paying Agent, the Initial Purchasers nor any of our or their respective agents are or will be responsible for those operations or procedures. We understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organisations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities and securities lending and borrowing. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organisations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodian relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest.

The summary does not take into account the effect of any overriding anti-avoidance legislation that may apply to Noteholders in their particular circumstances or to any wider arrangements to which they may be a party. The United Kingdom tax treatment of prospective Noteholders depends on their individual circumstances and may be subject to change in the future, possibly with retrospective effect.

Pursuant to the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, which applies within the EU (other than Denmark), the court which shall have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the Member State where the company has its “centre of main interests” (which, according to Article 3(1) of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, is “the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties”). The determination of where any such company has its “centre of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. The term “centre of main interests” is not a static concept and may change from time to time. Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation that a company has its “centre of main interests” in the Member State in which it has its registered office, this presumption only applies if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the 3-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Further, Preamble 30 of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation states that “it should be possible to rebut this presumption where the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual centre of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State.” In that respect, factors such as where board meetings are held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its business and the location where the large majority of the company’s creditors are established may all be relevant in the determination of the place where the company has its “centre of main interests.” The point at which a company’s “centre of main interests” is determined is at the time that the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened. If the centre of main interests of a company is and will remain located in the Member State (other than Denmark) in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation may only be commenced in such jurisdiction, and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation. Main insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be opened in another Member State. If the “centre of main interests” of a company is in one Member State (other than Denmark) under Article 3(2) of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open “territorial proceedings” only in the event that such company has an “establishment” in the territory of such other Member State. “Establishment” is defined in Article 2(10) of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation to mean any place of operations where the company carries out or has carried out in the 3-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a nontransitory economic activity with human means and assets. The effects of those territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the company situated in the territory of such other Member State where proceedings were opened. If a company does not have an establishment in any other 322 ----- Member State, no court of any other Member State has jurisdiction to open territorial proceedings in respect of such company under the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation. Where main insolvency proceedings in the Member State in which a company has its centre of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can be opened in another Member State where the company has an establishment, provided either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the Member State in which that company’s centre of main interests is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of either (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of the establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested or (ii) a public authority which, under the law of the Member State within whose territory the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court opening the main proceedings and give the same effect to the judgment so long as no secondary proceedings have been opened there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in a Member State (other than Denmark) which has jurisdiction to open main proceedings (because the company’s centre of main interests is there) may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that Member State in another Member State (other than Denmark), such as to remove assets of the company from that other Member State, subject to certain limitations, so long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other EU member state nor any preservation measure has been taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other EU member state where the company has assets.

With prior approval of the court, an administrator may deal with property subject to a fixed charge provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the administration’s purpose and that the administrator apply the net proceeds from the disposal of the property in question towards discharging the obligations of the company to the charge holder. Under English law there is a possibility that a court could recharacterize fixed security interests purported to be created by a security document as floating charges and the description given to security interests by the parties is not determinative. Whether security interests labelled as fixed will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will depend, among other things, on whether the chargee has the requisite degree of control over the relevant chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the chargee in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the secured assets without the consent of the chargee prior to crystallization, the court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge in the security documents.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

An administration order can be made if the court is satisfied that 324 ----- the relevant company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” and that the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. A company is unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (unable to pay its debts as they fall due) or if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities). Such insolvency is presumed if, among other matters, the company fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 or to satisfy in full or in part a judgment debt (or similar court order). An administrator can also be appointed out of court by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge and different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointor. The purpose of an administration is comprised of three parts that must be looked at successively: rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely upon immediate liquidation or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable, and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realising property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors. The order of priority which applies to any distribution to creditors is set out below (please see “—Priority on insolvency”). During the administration, in general no proceedings or other legal process may be commenced or continued against the company, or security enforced over the company’s property, except with leave of the court or the consent of the administrator. Accordingly, if any of the Issuer, the Guarantors or the providers of Collateral were to enter into administration, the Notes, the guarantees and the Collateral, as applicable, could not be enforced while the relevant company was in administration without the permission of the court or consent of the administrator. There can be no assurance that the Security Trustee would obtain such permission of the court or consent of the administrator. Certain creditors of a company in administration may be able to realize their security over that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003. If an English Obligor were to enter administration, it is possible that, to the extent that it is not a financial collateral arrangement, the security granted by it or the guarantee granted by it may not be enforced while it is in administration without the leave of the court or consent of the administrator. In addition, other than in limited circumstances, no administrative receiver can be appointed by a secured creditor in preference to an administrator, and any already appointed must resign if requested to do so by the administrator. Where the company is already in administration no other receiver may be appointed and an administrative receiver may only be appointed with the leave of a court or consent of the administrator. In addition, an administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business and, subject to certain requirements under the UK Insolvency Act 1986 (as amended) (the “Insolvency Act 1986”), dispose of the property of a company in administration (including property subject to a floating charge). In order to empower the Security Trustee to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator out of court to the company, the floating charge granted by the relevant English Obligor must constitute a “qualifying floating charge” for purposes of English insolvency law and, in the case of the ability to appoint an administrative receiver, the qualifying floating charge must, unless the security document pre-dates 15 September 2003, fall within one of the exceptions in the Insolvency Act 1986 to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers. The holder of a qualifying floating charge will also receive advance notice of an intention of the company to appoint an administrator or file for a voluntary liquidation allowing the charge holder to appoint its own administrator. In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it, (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act 1986. The Security Trustee will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with the fixed charge security interests, relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the relevant English Obligor’s property and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge. Whether the assets that are subject to the floating charges and other security will constitute substantially the whole of the relevant English Obligor’s assets at the time that the floating charges are enforced will be a question of fact at that time and there is no statutory guidance as to what percentage of a company’s assets should be charged to satisfy this test. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the Insolvency Act 1986), which will apply if the Issuer of the Notes creates a debt of at least £50,000,000 for the relevant company during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital markets investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency Act 1986, but is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument). 325 ----- If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference or an invalid floating charge. If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office. Further, upon the appointment of an administrator, any receiver of part of the company’s property must resign if required to do so by the administrator unless that receiver was appointed under a charge created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement”.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

There are three ways an English company may be placed into liquidation or “wound up,” being (1) Members’ Voluntary Liquidation (which is a procedure available to solvent companies only), (2) Creditors’ Voluntary Liquidation, and (3) Compulsory Winding-Up. On the voluntary liquidation of an English company, there is no automatic statutory moratorium in place preventing the holders of security interests from taking steps to enforce those security interests (although the liquidator or any creditor or shareholder of the company in liquidation may apply to court for a stay). Where a company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales is placed into liquidation, a creditor holding a valid mortgage, charge or other security interest has four options: (1) to realize the security, apply the proceeds towards discharge of the secured debt, and prove in the liquidation for any balance; (2) to retain the security and not prove in the liquidation; (3) to value the security and prove for any shortfall between that value and the value of the debt; and (4) to surrender the security and prove for the full amount of the debt. The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary liquidation. In a compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act 1986, any disposition of the relevant company’s property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced from the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition. Once a winding-up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed.

Unless creditors have agreed otherwise, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class. The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority): 1. First ranking: holders of fixed charge security and creditors with a proprietary interest in specific assets in the possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor but only to the extent of the realisations from those secured assets or with respect to the asset in which they have a proprietary interest; 2. Second ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which expenses are paid); 326 ----- 3. Third ranking: these are divided into ordinary preferential creditors and secondary preferential creditors with ordinary preferential creditors being paid in priority to secondary preferential creditors. Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; (c) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the date of insolvency; and (d) bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme up to the statutory limit. As between one another, ordinary preferential debts rank equally. Secondary preferential debts include (x) the balance of insured bank and building deposits above the statutory limit of amounts insured under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme and (y) with respect to all insolvencies commencing on or after 1 December 2020, claims by HMRC in respect of certain taxes including VAT, PAYE income tax (including student loan repayments), employee NI contributions and Construction Industry Scheme deductions (but excluding corporation tax and employer NI contributions) which are held by the company on behalf of employees and customers. As between another, secondary preferential debts rank equally; 4. Fourth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security. This would include any floating charge that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which, on a proper interpretation, was rendered a floating charge. However, before distributing asset realisations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (as defined below) must, subject to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors; 5. Fifth ranking: 1. firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and any secured creditor to the extent of any unsecured shortfall, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay the secured creditors any unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realisations from unsecured assets, as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors; 2. secondly, interest on the company’s debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the official rate) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation, or after the commencement of any administration which had been converted into a distributing administration. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the Notes or the guarantees, such interest due to the holders of the Notes may, if there are sufficient realisations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; and 3. thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid. This however does not include “currency conversion” claims following the English Supreme Court Lehman Brothers ruling dated 17 May 2017; and 4. Sixth ranking: shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company. Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the subordination language in the relevant documentation. An insolvency practitioner of the company (e.g., administrator, administrative receiver or liquidator) will generally be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors (after making full provision for preferential creditors and expenses out of floating charge realisations) (the “Prescribed Part”). Under current law, this ring-fence applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of floating charge realisations and 20% of the remainder over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £600,000, or £800,000 in relation to floating charges which come into existence on or after 6 327 ----- April. 2020. The Prescribed Part must be made available to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors.

In most cases this will only arise if the company is placed into administration or liquidation within a specified period (as set out in more detail below) of the granting of the guarantee or security. Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to an English company, he may challenge the validity of the guarantee or security given by such company. The following potential grounds for challenge may apply to guarantees and charges: _Transaction at an Undervalue_ Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company could apply to the court for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee if such liquidator or administrator believes that the creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue. There will only be a transaction at an undervalue, if at the time of the transaction or as a result of the transaction, the English company was or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency Act 1986). The transaction can be challenged if the English company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of two years (in the case of a transaction entered into between the relevant company and a person who is “connected” with that company, within the meaning of section 249 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (a “Connected",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

Therefore, any main insolvency proceedings in respect of the English Obligors would likely be commenced in England. However, pursuant to the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, where an English company conducts business in another member state of the EU, the jurisdiction of the English courts may be limited if the company’s “centre of main interests” is found to be in another Member State (please see “—European _Union”)._ It remains to be seen what impact the vote by the United Kingdom on 23 June 2016 to leave the EU will have on the regulatory environment in the EU and the United Kingdom, and on the applicability of EU law in the United Kingdom. During the Transition Period, expected to end on 31 December 2020 (but subject to the possibility of an extension of up to two years), the United Kingdom will continue to be treated as an EU Member State in certain respects, including for the purpose of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation. Following the Transition Period, the UK will cease to be treated as an EU Member State. The recognition of insolvency proceedings in the UK by EU Member States, and conversely of insolvency proceedings in EU Member States by the United Kingdom, following the Transition Period will be subject to the outcome of negotiations between the EU and the United Kingdom during the Transition Period. Depending on the outcome of negotiations between the EU and the United Kingdom during the Transition Period, it may be harder for United Kingdom office holders and United Kingdom restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognised in EU Member States and to effectively deal with assets located in EU Member States. Much will then depend upon the private international law rules in the particular EU Member State and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk. Absent alternative arrangements, the United Kingdom would cease to benefit from the reciprocal framework set out in the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation. In a “no deal” Brexit scenario, the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018 are expected to come into force, and would make significant amendments to the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation (as would from that point be applicable in the United Kingdom), intended to address this lack of reciprocity by removing provisions that grant automatic recognition to proceedings started elsewhere in the EU and amending the circumstances in which the English courts have jurisdiction to open proceedings (including providing, broadly, that the English courts may have jurisdiction to open proceedings if a company’s center of main interests (“COMI”) is in the United Kingdom, or if the company’s COMI is in a Member State of the EU and it has an establishment in the United Kingdom). Similarly, the UK Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006, which implement the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency in the United Kingdom, provide that a foreign (i.e., non-European) court may 323 ----- have jurisdiction where any English company has the centre of its main interests in such foreign jurisdiction or where it has an “establishment” (being a place of operations in such foreign jurisdiction, where it carries out non-transitory economic activities with human means and assets or services). Therefore, the centre of main interests of a company is determined on a factual basis taking into account where the company regularly conducts its affairs and where its creditors perceive a company’s centre of main interests to be. As the Issuer of the Notes and a number of the Guarantors are companies incorporated in England and Wales, there is a presumption that their “centre or main interests” is situated in England and Wales. English insolvency law may not be as favourable to the interests of investors as the laws of other jurisdictions with which investors are familiar. In the event that the Issuer or any one or more of the Guarantors experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. The Issuer’s obligations under the Notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors and secured by security interests over the Collateral. English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of a guarantee against a Guarantor and the enforceability of security interests over the Collateral. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to certain limitations on the guarantees or the security interests over the Collateral.

The Insolvency Act 2020 introduced a number of substantial and permanent changes to the insolvency regime of the United Kingdom including the following: _Moratorium_ The Insolvency Act 2020 introduces a new standalone moratorium to facilitate company restructurings. The entry into a moratorium for companies incorporated in England and Wales would be similar to the current out of court administrator appointment procedure, i.e., filing papers at court. A “moratorium monitor” (the “Monitor”) (an insolvency practitioner and officer of the court) will file their consent to act and confirm that they have assessed the company’s eligibility and that all moratorium qualifying conditions are satisfied. Costs incurred during a moratorium will be treated in the same way as expenses in an administration. Where a company exits a moratorium and subsequently enters administration or liquidation, any unpaid moratorium costs will have super priority over any costs or claims in the administration or liquidation, including the expense of those later procedures. The moratorium is intended to enable the company to reach an agreement with creditors and the Monitor will be obliged to monitor whether it remains likely that the moratorium will result in the rescue of the company as a going concern (which is one of the eligibility criteria for a company to avail itself of the moratorium). The eligibility criteria require the directors to state that the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts. A company which has entered into a moratorium, administration or company voluntary arrangement in the last 12 months is not eligible to enter into a moratorium. Certain categories of companies are excluded from being eligible (including those “excluded” as parties to capital markets arrangements as more particularly described in the Insolvency Act 2020). The moratorium shall last for an initial period of up to 20 business days beginning with the business day after the day on which the moratorium comes into force, which may be extended (i) by the directors, for a period of a further 20 business days, (ii) with creditor consent, for a total period of a year (including the initial 20 business day period), and (iii) by the court, for an unlimited period. The moratorium imposes a general restriction on the enforcement or payment of debts, insolvency proceedings and legal proceedings and the crystallization of floating charges. The moratorium also impacts the company’s ability to engage in a range of corporate acts including those which relate to obtaining credit, the grant of security, entering into market contracts, payment of certain pre-moratorium debts, disposal of property, disposal of hire-purchase property and disposal of charged property free from charge. The Monitor can terminate the moratorium on various grounds, including if the Monitor thinks that the moratorium is no longer likely to result in the rescue of the company as a going concern, or is unable to pay moratorium debts, or pre-moratorium debts for which the company does not have a payment holiday, as and when those debts fall due. Creditors and other persons affected by the moratorium are entitled to apply to the court to challenge the Monitor’s actions. A creditor or member of the company may challenge the conduct of or continuation of the moratorium on the ground that the interests of the company’s creditors or members generally are being unfairly harmed. _Certain ipso facto clauses to be rendered ineffective_ The Insolvency Act 2020 renders ineffective termination clauses in contracts for the supply of goods and services where the termination clause is activated by the purchaser of the goods or services becoming subject to a 330 ----- formal insolvency procedure (so-called ‘ipso facto’ clauses). This provision does not apply in relation to certain types of financial contracts, or where the company or the supplier are engaged in certain types of financial services. _Restructuring plan_ The Insolvency Act 2020 introduces a new restructuring process, similar to a scheme of arrangement but with an ability for cross class cramdown to bind dissenting stakeholders. This standalone restructuring plan will be available to certain companies that have encountered, or are likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, their ability to carry on business as a going concern. The compromise or arrangement proposed in the plan must have as its purpose the elimination, reduction or prevention of, or mitigation of the effect of, any such financial difficulties. The process closely resembles that for a scheme of arrangement. However, unlike a scheme of arrangement, to commence this process a restructuring plan proposal can be made not only by the company, but also any creditor or member of the company, or if the company is being wound up, the liquidator, or if the company is in administration, the administrator and accordingly, should be filed at court. Every creditor or member whose rights are affected should be able to participate in a meeting.

An English Obligor may be able to pursue a scheme in respect of its financial liabilities. In addition, a foreign Guarantor which is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act 1986 and has a “sufficient connection” to England and Wales could also pursue a scheme. In practice, a foreign company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb has been found to be satisfied where, amongst other things, the company’s COMI is in England, the company’s finance documents are English law-governed, or the company’s finance documents have been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by English law. Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not any of the grounds of the second limb are satisfied in the present case.

A transaction might be subject to being set aside as a transaction at an undervalue if the company makes a gift to a person, if the company receives no consideration or if the company receives consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company. However, a court generally will not intervene if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit it. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been in if the transaction had not been entered into. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English company was insolvent unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a Connected Person, in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the Connected Person must demonstrate the solvency of the English company in such proceedings. The Issuer cannot assure holders of the Notes that in the event of insolvency, the granting of the security or the giving of the guarantees by companies incorporated under the laws of England and Wales would not be challenged by a liquidator or administrator or that a court would support the Group’s analysis that (in any event) the security and guarantees were entered into in good faith for the purposes described above. In general terms, in such circumstances the courts of England and Wales have the power to make void such transactions, or restore the position to what it would have been if the company had not entered into the transaction. If a court voided any grant of security or giving of any guarantee as a result of a transaction at an undervalue or preference, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, investors would cease to have the benefit of such security or a claim against the Guarantor in respect of such guarantee (as applicable). _Preference_ Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company could apply to the court for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee if such liquidator or administrator believes that the creation of such security interest or such guarantee constituted a preference. There will only be a 328 ----- preference if, at the time of the transaction or as a result of the transaction, the English company was or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency Act 1986). The transaction can be challenged if the English company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of six months (if the beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a Connected Person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a Connected Person, except where such beneficiary is a connected person by reason only of being the company’s employee) from the date the English company grants the security interest or the guarantee. A transaction will constitute a factual preference if it has the effect of putting a creditor of the English company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation) than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into. If the court determines that the transaction constituted such a preference, the court has very wide powers for restoring the position to what it would have been if that preference had not been given, which could include reducing payments under the Notes and the guarantees (although there is protection for a third party who enters into one of the transactions in good faith and without notice). However, for the court to do so, it must be shown that in deciding to give the factual preference the English company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English company was insolvent at the relevant time and that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a Connected Person (except where such beneficiary is a Connected Person by reason only of being the company’s employee), in which case there is a presumption that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect and the Connected Person must demonstrate in such proceedings that there was no such influence. _Transaction Defrauding Creditors_ Under English insolvency law, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue and was made for the purposes of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a claim against a company, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim, which that person is making or may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors. This provision may be used by any person who claims to be a “victim” of the transaction and, subject to certain conditions, the FCA and the UK Pensions Regulator, and is not therefore limited to liquidators or administrators. There is no time limit in the English insolvency legislation within which the challenge must be made (subject to the normal statutory limitations period) and the relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time of the transaction. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction. _Extortionate Credit Transaction_ An administrator or a liquidator can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. The court can review extortionate credit transactions entered into by an English Obligor up to three years before the day on which the English Obligor entered into administration or went into liquidation. A transaction is “extortionate” if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the terms of it are (or were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly contravened ordinary principles of fair dealing. _Grant of Floating Charge_ Under English insolvency law, if an English Obligor is unable to pay its debts at the time of (or as a result of) granting the floating charge, and the floating charge was granted within the specified period referred to below, then such floating charge is invalid except to the extent of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant English Obligor at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge. The requirement for the English Obligor to be insolvent at the time of (or as a result of) granting the floating charge does not apply where the floating charge is granted to a Connected Person and within the specified period referred to below. If the floating charge is granted to a Connected Person, and the floating charge was granted within the specified period referred to below, then the floating charge is invalid except to the extent of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant English Obligor at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge, whether the relevant English Obligor is solvent or insolvent. The granting of the charge can be challenged only if the relevant English Obligor enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of one year (if the beneficiary is not a Connected Person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a 329 ----- Connected Person) from the date the relevant English Obligor grants the floating charge. However, if the Floating Charge qualifies as a “financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003, the floating charge will not be subject to challenge as described in this paragraph. An administrator, or a liquidator (as applicable), does not need to apply to court for an order declaring that a floating charge is invalid. Any floating charge created during the relevant time period is automatically invalid except to the extent of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant English company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge (plus certain interest), whether the relevant English company is solvent or insolvent at the time of grant.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

In Scotland, forms of security are closely tied to specific types of property. Since Scots law does not recognise the English law concept of “equity” there is more focus on the legal formalities rather than the intention of the parties with respect to the creation of security interests. If the strict legal requirements under Scots law are not met, there will be no security over the subject notwithstanding the intention of the parties. In respect of movable property, it is essential that the security holder has some form of possession (which may take different forms) over the subject in order to create a valid security interest. Scots law does not differentiate between legal and equitable ownership of property so, for instance, in order to create a security interest over shares in companies incorporated in Scotland, the security holder (or its nominee) must be registered as the shareholder. Furthermore, as there is no Scottish equivalent of an English law equitable assignment, a Scottish interest in incorporeal property will only be created when the assignation is properly notified to the relevant parties. Fixed charges over land and buildings situated in Scotland may only be created using a standard security (which is the Scots law equivalent of a legal mortgage over an interest of land) and is governed by statute.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

An administrator can also be appointed out of court by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge and different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointor. During the administration, or after a notice of intention to appoint an administrator has been lodged, amongst other restrictions, in general no proceedings or other legal process may be commenced or continued against the company, or security enforced over the company’s property, except with leave of the court or the consent of the administrator. The moratorium does not, however, apply to a “security financial collateral arrangement” (such as a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003. During the administration of a company, a creditor would not be able to enforce any security interest (other than security financial collateral agreements) or guarantee granted by it without the consent of the administrator or the court. In addition, an administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act 1986, dispose of the property of a company in administration (including property subject to a floating charge). In order to empower the Security Agent to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator to the company, the floating charge granted by the Scottish Guarantor must constitute a “qualifying floating charge” for purposes of Scottish insolvency law and, in the case of the ability to appoint an administrative receiver, the qualifying floating charge must, unless the security document pre-dates 15 September 2003, fall within one of the exceptions in the Enterprise Act 2002 to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers. In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it; (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company; (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator receiver; or (d) purports to empower the holder of a floating charge in Scotland to appoint a receiver who on appointment would be an administrative receiver (although this is only permitted under limited circumstances). The Security Agent will be 333 ----- the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with the fixed charge security interests, relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the Scottish Guarantor’s property and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge. Whether the assets that are subject to the floating charge and other security will constitute the whole or substantially the whole of the Scottish Guarantor’s assets at the time the floating charge is enforced will be a question of fact at that time. The most relevant exception to the prohibition is that the Security Agent can appoint an administrator relating to a “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the Insolvency Act 1986), which is the case if the issue of the note creates a debt of at least £50,000,000 for the relevant company during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital markets investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency Act 1986, but is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument). _Prescribed part_ An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or liquidator of a Scottish company will be required to ring-fence a certain percentage (the Prescribed Part) of the proceeds of enforcement of a floating charge security granted on or after 15 September 2003 for the benefit of unsecured creditors. Under current law, this applies to 50 per cent. of the first £10,000 of net floating charge realisations and 20 per cent. of the remainder over £10,000, and the Prescribed Part is subject to a maximum aggregate cap of £600,000 for the holder of a floating charge created prior to 6 April 2020, and £800,000 where the floating charge was created after 6 April 2020. The Prescribed Part must be made available to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors. The Prescribed Part will not be available for any shortfall claims of secured creditors unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors’ claims in full. This requirement shall, however, not apply to the extent that the floating charge constitutes a financial collateral arrangement under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

In most cases this will only arise if the company is placed into administration or liquidation within a specified period (as set out in more detail below) of the granting of the guarantee or security, though common law challenges can be brought beyond the specified period. If, during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to a Scottish company, he may challenge the validity of the guarantee or security given by such company in certain circumstances. The following potential grounds for challenge may apply to guarantees and security interests: _Gratuitous Alienations (s.242 Insolvency Act 1986)_ Under Scottish insolvency law, a liquidator, administrator or creditor of a Scottish company could apply to the court for an order to set aside a security interest or a guarantee granted by the company (or give other relief) on the grounds that the creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a gratuitous alienation. Under common law, any alienation (other than in the ordinary course of business or in implementation of prior obligations) by an insolvent debtor which confers a benefit on a creditor and prevents a fair division of the insolvent estate among creditors is reducible at the instance of present and future creditors. The transaction can be challenged if the Scottish company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of two years from the date the Scottish company grants the security interest or the guarantee or five years in the case of an alienation to a “connected person” of the Scottish company. A transaction might be subject to being set aside as a gratuitous alienation (the English equivalent is a transaction at undervalue) if the company makes a gift to a person (save in certain specified circumstances), or if the company receives no consideration or if the company receives inadequate consideration. However a gratuitous alienation action may be defeated if the person seeking to uphold the alienation establishes (i) that immediately or at any other time or after the alienation the company’s assets were greater than its liabilities; (ii) the alienation was made for adequate consideration; or (iii) the alienation was a birthday, Christmas or other gift for a charitable purpose to a person not an associate of the company, which having regard to all circumstances it was reasonable for the company (without prejudice to any right or interest acquired in good faith and for value from the recipient of the alienation) to make. If the court determines that the transaction was a gratuitous alienation the court can grant a decree of reduction or for restoration of the property or assets or such other redress as may be appropriate (although there is protection for a third party who acquires in good faith and for value any right or interest through the transferee in the alienation). A transaction made at a time when a company is insolvent may also constitute a gratuitous alienation at common law. In these circumstances, no time limits apply in relation to challenging it. A gratuitous alienation 334 ----- may constitute wrongful (or indeed fraudulent) trading, or a breach of duty, and lead to action being raised against directors personally. _Unfair Preferences (s.243 Insolvency Act 1986)_ Under Scottish insolvency law, a liquidator, administrator or creditor of a Scottish company could apply to the court for an order to set aside a security interest or a guarantee (or give other relief) on the grounds that the security interest or such guarantee constituted an unfair preference. Under common law, an unfair preference (other than in the ordinary course of business or in implementation of prior obligations) by an insolvent debtor which prejudices the general body of creditors is reducible at the instance of present and future creditors. The transaction can be challenged if the Scottish company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of six months from the date the Scottish company grants the security interest or the guarantee. A transaction may constitute an unfair preference if it has the effect of putting a creditor of the Scottish company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation) than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into. If the court determines that the transaction was an unfair preference, the court may grant a decree of reduction or restoration of the property or assets or such other redress as may be appropriate (although there is protection for a third party who acquires in good faith and for value any right or interest from or through the creditor in whose favour the preference was created). An unfair preference may also be challenged at common law and no time limits apply. An unfair preference may also constitute wrongful (or indeed fraudulent) trading or a breach of duty and lead to actions being raised against directors personally. The following will not constitute unfair preferences: - transactions in the ordinary course of trade or business; - payment in cash for a debt that, when paid, has become payable, unless the transaction was collusive with the purpose of prejudicing the general body of creditors; - transactions where the parties take on reciprocal obligations, unless the transaction was collusive; and - the granting of a mandate by a company authorising a person to pay over funds in compliance with a court decree in certain prescribed circumstances. _Extortionate Credit Transactions (s.244 Insolvency Act 1986)_ A liquidator, administrator or creditor of a Scottish company could apply to the court for an order to set aside a security interest or guarantee granted by the company on the grounds that the credit transaction is “extortionate”. The transaction must have been entered into within three years prior to the administration or liquidation and must have involved the provision of credit to the company on a basis which, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, requires grossly exorbitant payments to be made or otherwise grossly contravenes the ordinary principles of fair dealing. _Grant of Floating Charge (s.245 Insolvency Act 1986)_ Under Scottish insolvency law, a floating charge granted by the Scottish Guarantor is invalid except to the extent of the aggregate of (1) the consideration for the creation of the floating charge consisting of money paid or goods or services supplied to the Scottish Guarantor at the time of the creation of the floating charge, (2) the value of the consideration consisting of the discharge or reduction of any debt of the Scottish Guarantor at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge and (3) the amount of any interest payable on these sums, if the Scottish Guarantor enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a statutory challenge period. The statutory challenge period is a period of one year (if the beneficiary is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) from the date the Scottish Guarantor grants the floating charge. However, if the beneficiary is not a connected person, no amount of the floating charge will be invalid unless the Scottish Guarantor is unable to pay its debts as they fall due (as defined by s.123 Insolvency Act 1986) or becomes unable to so pay its debts as a consequence of granting the floating charge, This ability to challenge does not, however, apply to any charge created or otherwise arising under a “security financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral (No. 2) Regulations 2003.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

A third party dealing in good faith with a company can still enforce the transaction. However, a third party will not be acting in good faith if it knows the transaction is beyond the power of the directors and is not for the benefit of the company (e.g. a guarantee or security interest has no corporate benefit for the company but benefits the directors or another person).

This remains the case unless a chapter 11 trustee is appointed or the chapter 11 case is converted to a chapter 7 liquidation under the US Bankruptcy Code, in which case a chapter 11 trustee or chapter 7 trustee remains in possession of the debtor’s property. Moreover, the US Bankruptcy Code permits the debtor to continue to retain and use collateral even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that, upon the secured creditor’s request, the secured creditor is given “adequate protection” of its interest in the debtor’s property. The term “adequate protection” is not defined in the US Bankruptcy Code, but it may include making periodic cash payments, providing an additional or replacement lien or granting other relief, in each case, to the extent that the value of the secured creditor’s interest in such collateral decreases during the pendency of the bankruptcy case as a result of, among other things, the use, sale or lease of such collateral or the imposition of the automatic stay. The type of adequate protection provided to a secured creditor may vary according to circumstances. A US bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor is not entitled to adequate protection for a decrease in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the amount of the debt that it secures. Only the debtor in a chapter 11 bankruptcy case may propose a chapter 11 plan unless the debtor fails to file a plan within the first 120 days of the case or its plan has not been accepted within the first 180 days of the case 337 ----- by each class of claims or interests that is impaired under the plan. The bankruptcy court may reduce or enlarge these periods for cause upon request of a party in interest. The 120-day period could be extended for up to 18 months after a chapter 11 filing, while the 180-day period could be extended for up to 20 months after a chapter 11 filing. During these “exclusive periods”, other parties, such as secured creditors, would be precluded from proposing or soliciting acceptances of their own chapter 11 plans. In view of the automatic stay, the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection”, the exclusive periods, and the broad discretionary power of a US bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict: - whether or when a holder of the Notes could enforce its security interests; - the value of the collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition or at the time a chapter 11 plan is proposed or confirmed; or - whether or to what extent holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the collateral through the requirement of “adequate protection”.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

The bankruptcy court may, depending on the facts and circumstances, authorise the debtor-in-possession or trustee to obtain new credit or incur new debt that is secured by a lien that is senior or equal to existing liens, provided that, among other things, there is adequate protection of the interests of the holders of the existing liens. In other words, it is possible that in connection with a chapter 11 case of one or more of the Obligors, such Obligor or Obligors would be permitted to incur new debt that is secured by a lien that is senior or equal to the liens that exist at the time of the chapter 11 filing.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

In the event of a US bankruptcy case, the holders of the Notes will be entitled to post-petition interest under the US Bankruptcy Code only if the value of their security interest in the Collateral is greater than their pre-bankruptcy claim. Holders of the Notes may be deemed to have an unsecured claim if the obligation under the Notes equals or exceeds the fair market value of the Collateral securing the Notes.

A chapter 11 plan provides for the comprehensive treatment of all claims asserted against the debtor and the property of the bankruptcy estate and may provide for the readjustment or extinguishment of equity interests. Claims and interests may be classified by type. Only those classes of claims and interests impaired by the plan may vote to accept or reject such plan. Classes of claims and interests that are unimpaired are not entitled to vote on the plan and are deemed to accept it. Classes of claims and interests that receive no distributions under the plan are not entitled to vote on the plan and are deemed to reject it. A class of claims is deemed to accept the plan if creditors holding at least two- thirds in amount and more than one-half in number of the claims of such class that vote, vote to accept the plan. A plan can be confirmed by the bankruptcy court over the dissenting votes of members of a class that accepts the plan overall. Furthermore, even if one or more impaired classes reject the plan, the plan may still be confirmed, subject to specific statutory requirements, in accordance with the “cram-down” provisions of the US Bankruptcy Code, which require, among other things, that one impaired class has accepted the plan and that the plan does not discriminate unfairly, and is fair and equitable, with respect to each class of claims or interests that is impaired under, and has not accepted, the plan. This could allow the debtor or other plan proponent to confirm its plan over the objection of one or more dissenting classes. Such a “cram-down” plan could provide for, among other things, deferred cash payments, which may extend over a period beyond the maturity of the Notes, in an amount equal to the secured portion of the Notes (as further described above in “Post-petition interest”), which may bear 338 ----- interest at a rate determined by the bankruptcy court that may be lower than the interest rate established by the Notes.

74_1,Offerings 2020.md,23,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,23.1,England and Wales and Scotland,23.1.1,,"The following summary with respect to the enforceability of certain US court judgments in England and Wales and Scotland is based upon advice provided to us by US, English and Scottish legal advisers. The United States and England and Scotland currently do not have a treaty between them providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the US based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon US federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognised and/or enforced in England and Wales or in Scotland. In order to enforce any such US judgment in England and Wales or Scotland, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England and Wales or Scotland (as applicable). In such an action, an English or Scottish court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the US court (subject to what is said below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment or decree conform (as applicable) on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defence to it). Recognition and enforcement of a US judgment by an English or Scottish court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the following: - the US court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English or Scottish conflicts of laws principles and rules of English or Scottish private international law; - the US judgment not having been given in breach of a jurisdiction or arbitration clause; - the US judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money; - the US judgment not contravening English or Scottish public policy or the Human Rights Act 1998; - the US judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in respect of a penalty or fine, or otherwise involving the enforcement of a non-English or non-Scottish penal or revenue law; - the US judgment not being contrary to the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980; - the US judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English or Scottish principles of natural justice; - there not having been a prior inconsistent decision of an English or Scottish court in respect of the same matter involving the same parties; and - the English or Scottish enforcement proceedings being commenced within the relevant limitation period. If an English or Scottish court gives judgment for the sum payable under a US judgment, the English or Scottish judgment will be enforceable by methods generally available for this purpose. The judgment creditor is able to utilise any method or methods of enforcement available to him/her at the time. In addition, it may not be possible to obtain an English or Scottish judgment or to enforce that judgment if the judgment debtor is subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings, or if the judgment debtor has any set-off or counter-claim against the judgment creditor. Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in England and Wales or Scotland judgments in civil and commercial matters that have been obtained from US federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be recognised and/or enforced in England and Wales or Scotland. In addition, it is questionable whether an English or Scottish court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in England and Wales or Scotland, instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon US federal securities laws. 344 ----- Important points to note include the following: - claims may become barred under the Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1973 or may be or become subject to defences of retention, compensation, set-off or counter claim; - in proceedings in the Scottish courts, matters of US law or any other system of law other than Scots law affecting the rights and duties of the parties under the documents which are governed by US law or any other system of law other than Scots law would be required to be established as a matter of evidence and in the absence of such establishment the Scottish courts would apply Scots law; - while the Scottish courts will uphold the choice of US law to govern the documents stipulated to be governed by US Law, they will not give effect to any provision of such documents which, though valid under US law, are considered by the Scottish courts to be contrary to public policy in Scotland or if the choice of law purports to avoid mandatory rules of another country, such as one with which the transaction is wholly connected; and - insolvency proceedings in respect of the Scottish Guarantor would generally be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Session (where the “centre of main interests” of the Scottish Guarantor is situated in the United Kingdom), though territorial proceedings might be raised against the Scottish Guarantor in respect of assets in another jurisdiction. 345 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

General information These notes provide additional information about the disclosures within the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements. Further information can be found in the Group’s 2019 Annual Report and Accounts on pages 138–208. Drax Group plc (the Company) is incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act. The Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Group) principally operate in the electricity and gas markets within the UK. The address of the Company’s registered office and principal establishment is Drax Power Station, Selby, North Yorkshire, YO8 8PH, United Kingdom. ###### 2. Segmental reporting The Group is organised into three businesses, with a dedicated management team for each, and a central corporate function providing certain specialist and shared services. The Group’s businesses, which each represent a reportable operating segment for the purpose of segmental reporting, are: Generation: power generation activities in the UK; Customers: supply of electricity and gas to business customers in the UK; and Pellet Production: production of sustainable compressed wood pellets at our processing facilities in the US. Information reported to the Board for the purposes of assessing performance and making investment decisions is based on these three segments. The measure of profit or loss for each reportable segment presented to the Board on a regular basis is Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the basis of preparation) Operating costs are allocated to segments to the extent they are directly attributable to the activities of that segment. Corporate office costs are included within central costs.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654
74_1,Offerings 2020.md,66,AVAILABLE INFORMATION,66.34,Seasonality of trading,66.34.1,,"The primary activities of our Group are affected by seasonality. Demand in the UK for electricity and gas is typically higher in the winter period (October to March) when temperatures are lower, and thus drives higher prices and dispatch. Conversely, demand is typically lower in the summer months (April to September), when prices are lower. This trend is experienced by all of our UK-based businesses, as they operate within the UK electricity and gas markets and is most notable within the Generation business due to its scale and the flexible operation of thermal generation plant when prices are low in the summer. The US-based Pellet Production business has a regular production and dispatch schedule, driven by regular demand from the Generation business for wood pellets, which largely insulates it from demand fluctuations caused by seasonality.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

The tax credit is based upon the expected tax rate for the full year which is applied to taxable profits/(losses) for the interim period, together with any charge or credit in respect of prior years and the tax effect of any exceptional items (see note 6). Current tax, including UK Corporation tax and US tax, is calculated as the income taxes payable on taxable profits, or recoverable in respect of tax losses, for the interim period. Deferred tax is calculated as the income taxes payable or recoverable in future accounting periods in respect of temporary differences which may be taxable or allowed as deductible. Temporary differences themselves represent the difference between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the financial statements and the relevant tax base thereon.

Sufficient reserves are available across the Group as a whole to make future distributions in accordance with the Group’s dividend policy for the foreseeable future. The majority of the Group’s distributable reserves are held in intermediate holding companies and operating subsidiaries. Management actively monitors the level of distributable reserves in each company in the Group, ensuring adequate reserves are available for upcoming dividend payments and that the Parent Company has access to these reserves. The immediate cash resources of the Group of £481.5 million, comprised of cash and cash equivalents that are accessible on demand.

Earnings per share Earnings per share (EPS) represents the amount of earnings (post-tax profits) attributable to each ordinary share or dilutive potential ordinary share we have in issue. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the Group’s earnings (profit after tax in accordance with IFRS) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.

Following a reduction in the significance of the interdependencies between the coal generation assets and the biomass generation assets over time, as of 26 February 2020 they have been assessed as being two separate CGUs. Following the coal generation assets becoming a separate CGU, an impairment review was undertaken. The recoverable amount of the coal generation assets was determined based on a value in use calculation. This calculation uses cash flow projections based on the Group’s established planning model approved by the Board covering the period through to coal closure in September 2022. The calculation concluded that the recoverable amount of the coal CGU was significantly lower than the carrying amount of the coal generation assets in the Group’s balance sheet. Accordingly, in the six months ended 30 June 2020, an asset obsolescence charge of £224.2 million has been recognised to write the coal generation assets down to their recoverable amount of £nil. Sensitivity analysis indicated that any reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions, which are the allocation of operating costs and discount rate, would not result in a materially different outcome.

As such, no provision for termination benefits or any other costs relating to the coal closure have been recognised as at 30 June 2020. Consultations are expected to be concluded in the second half of 2020 at which point any required provisions will be recognised. The anticipated one-off costs of closure, comprising termination benefits and costs of disposal for associated assets, are in the region of £25–35 million. ###### 10. Borrowings In June 2020, the Group completed a three-year extension to the £125 million environmental, social and governance (ESG) facility agreement originally entered into during July 2019. This extended the contractual maturity of the facility to 2025.

The Group has a strong focus on cash flow discipline and uses various methods to manage liquidity. These methods, the most material of which are described in further detail below, have been used to a broadly consistent level throughout the year unless otherwise stated. Cash from ROCs is typically realised several months after the ROC is earned; however, through standard ROC sales and ROC purchase arrangements the Group is able to accelerate cash flows over a proportion of these assets. The net impact on operating cash flows for the six months ended 30 June 2020 of accelerating cash flows through ROC purchases and ROC sales was an outflow of £82.4 million (six months ended 30 June 2019: £77.0 million inflow). The Group also has access to facilities enabling it to sell ROC trade receivables on a non-recourse basis. Utilisation of these facilities was £47.3 million at 30 June 2020 (as at 31 December 2019: £nil). From time to time, when market conditions change, the Group can rebase foreign currency contracts (including crosscurrency interest rate swaps). In the six months to 30 June 2020 this generated a working capital benefit, which is reflected as an adjustment to certain remeasurements of derivative contracts in the table above. The total cash benefit released from related trades that remained outstanding at 30 June 2020 was £146.6 million (as at 31 December 2019: £106.8 million). This cash benefit includes £87.8 million (as at 31 December 2019: £84.3 million) released from foreign currency contracts and £58.8 million (as at 31 December 2019: £22.5 million) from cross-currency interest rate swaps. The Customers business has access to a facility which enables it to accelerate cash flows associated with trade receivables on a non-recourse basis. This facility generated a net cash outflow of £6.0 million in the six months ended 30 June 2020 (six months ended 30 June 2019: net £nil cash impact), reflected as an increase in receivables in the table above. The facility terms were amended in 2019, increasing the facility size to £200 million from £150 million. Utilisation of the facility was £156.2 million at 30 June 2020 (as at 31 December 2019: £162.2 million). The Group has sought to normalise payments across its supplier base resulting in certain suppliers extending payment terms and some reducing terms. Suppliers are able to access a supply chain finance facility provided by a bank, for which the suppliers can receive funds in advance of the payment terms agreed with Drax. The facility does not affect the Group’s working capital, as payment terms remain unaltered with the Group. At 30 June 2020, the Group had trade payables of £29.5 million (as at 31 December 2019: £33.1 million) related to reverse factoring. The Group also has access to a number of payment facilities to leverage scale and efficiencies in transaction processing, whilst providing a working capital benefit for the Group due to a short extension of payment terms within a normal working capital cycle. The amount outstanding under these facilities at 30 June 2020 was £104.2 million (as at 31 December 2019: £90.6 million). More detail on the Group’s approach to working capital and liquidity management is provided in note 13. ###### 12. Reconciliation of net debt Net debt is calculated by taking the Group’s borrowings (note 10) and subtracting cash and cash equivalents. The table below reconciles net debt in terms of changes in these balances across the year.

Borrowings do not include other financial liabilities such as IFRS 16 lease liabilities, pension obligations and trade and other payables. The Group has entered into cross-currency interest rate swaps, fixing the sterling value of the principal repayments in respect of the Group’s USD denominated debt (see note 10). If USD balances are translated at the hedged rate, rather than the rate prevailing at the balance sheet date, borrowings would be reduced by £36.4 million (as at 31 December 2019: £12.2 million). The corresponding value of the hedging instrument is recognised at its fair value as a derivative financial instrument. ###### 13. Financial risk management The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, liquidity risk, inflation risk, counterparty risk and credit risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of commodity and financial markets and seeks to manage potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. Risk management is overseen by risk management committees which identify, evaluate and hedge financial risks in close coordination with the Group’s trading and treasury functions under policies approved by the Board. As the Covid-19 pandemic has progressed there have been significant impacts to financial markets, albeit the full longerterm macro-economic effects remain uncertain. The associated principal risks to the Group are volatility in financial markets, including the impact of weaker sterling affecting the cost of biomass, the liquidity risk associated with potential increases in borrowing costs and the availability of debt financing. The Group has financial risk management policies in place to mitigate and reduce exposure to these risks. A full review of these policies alongside market sensitivities has been completed in addition to an increased level of monitoring and actions to appropriately manage the risks. The Group’s well-established foreign exchange hedging programme manages the risk associated with its foreign currency exposure over a rolling five-year period with protection against sterling weakness in place out to 2025. The Group maintains a mixture of cash and cash equivalents and committed facilities to ensure sufficient funding for business requirements. At 30 June 2020 the Group had cash and cash equivalents of £481.5 million, which alongside the committed but undrawn facilities provides significant headroom over and above the short-term liquidity requirements. In June, the Group completed a three-year extension to the £125 million ESG facility extending its contractual maturity to 2025. After taking into account the effect of hedging, all of the Group’s borrowings are at fixed interest rates, mitigating the risk of increases. Credit risk associated with derivatives and investing activities are diversified across a range of highly rated counterparties reducing counterparty exposures, in line with the Group’s policy. In addition to the financial market impact, the Group’s Customers business is exposed to higher credit risk, where the impact of Covid-19 has increased the risk of potential customer failures and expected credit losses. The Group extended its trade credit insurance programme in 2019 and continues to use this facility, providing mitigation to the risk of potential customer failure.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

Price variations and market cycles have historically influenced the financial results of the Group and are expected to continue to do so. The Group has a policy of securing forward power sales, purchases of fuel and CO2 emissions allowances when profitable to do so and in line with specified limits under approved policies. Forward power sales can be secured up to 100% of forecast availability two years out. All commitments to sell power under fixed-price contracts are designated as cash flow hedges as they reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of power ----- The Group purchases sustainable biomass, coal and other fuels under either fixed or variable priced contracts with different maturities, principally from a number of international sources. The Group considers all such contracts to be economic hedges. The contracts are either outside of the scope of IFRS 9, are recognised at fair value through profit or loss, or the Group applies the own-use exemption or hedge accounting in accordance with IFRS 9. Where forward power curves are less liquid, the Group uses financially settled gas sales as a proxy for power to mitigate the risk of power price fluctuations. The Group also purchases gas under fixed-price contracts to meet the demand of its energy supply customers and as a fuel for the CCGT assets within its gas-fired generation portfolio. The Group purchases CO2 emissions allowances under fixed-price contracts with different maturity dates from a range of domestic and international sources. All commitments to purchase CO2 emissions allowances under fixed-price contracts are designated as cash flow hedges as they reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of CO2 emissions allowances.",N/A,as_expected,2020,654

The Group also has limited exposure to translation risk in relation to its net investment in its US subsidiary, Drax Biomass Inc. It is the Group’s policy to hedge material transactional exposures using a variety of derivatives to fix the sterling value of foreign currency cash flows, except where there is an economic hedge inherent in the transaction. The Group enters into derivative contracts in line with the currency risk management policy, including forwards and options, to manage the risks associated with its anticipated foreign currency requirements over a rolling five-year period covering contracted exposures and a proportion of highly probable forecast transactions.

The Group has also taken out a floating-to-fixed swap to fix the interest payments on the £375 million private placement and the £125 million ESG facility. Through the use of these interest rates swaps the Group has fixed all of the market-based interest payments on its floating rate debt instruments. As such the Group has mitigated its exposure to interest rate risk in relation to its debt instruments.

Of the Group’s three operating segments, two are exposed to different levels and concentrations of credit risk, largely reflecting the number, size and nature of their respective customers. The Pellet Production segment only trades intragroup. The highest risk is in the Customers segment, with a large number of customers of varying sizes operating in a variety of markets. In particular, Opus Energy carries lower concentrations but higher levels of credit risk owing to a customer base comprised largely of smaller retail and commercial entities. In the Customers segment, credit risk is managed by checking a company’s creditworthiness and financial strength both before commencing trade and during the business relationship. Credit risk is monitored and managed by business sector. In response to the increased risk from Covid-19, the Customers segment has increased minimum credit requirements and excluded a number of identified high-risk business types from its acquisition activity in the SME sector. The Customers segment also extended its trade credit insurance programme in late 2019 to increase its mitigation to credit risk. In addition, credit risk is transferred on the billed and unbilled receivables monetised through the non-recourse facility described in note 11. For the Generation segment, the risk arises from treasury, trading and energy procurement activities, as well as the sale of by-products from generation activities. Wholesale counterparty credit exposures are monitored by individual counterparty and by category of credit rating. Counterparty credit exposures are subject to approved limits. The Group uses master netting agreements to reduce credit risk and net settles payments with counterparties where net settlement provisions exist. In addition, the Group employs a variety of other methods to mitigate credit risk: margining, various forms of parent company guarantee, deed of charge, cash collateral, letters of credit and surety bonds. The majority of the Generation business’s credit risk is with counterparties in related energy industries or with financial institutions. In addition, where deemed appropriate, the Group has historically purchased credit default swaps. The investment of surplus cash is undertaken with the objective of ensuring that there is sufficient liquidity at all times, so that funds are available to meet liabilities as they fall due, whilst securing a return from invested funds and preserving the capital value of those funds within Board-approved policies.

The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders’ equity (excluding the hedge and cost of hedging reserves), plus net debt. Net debt is comprised of borrowings and cash and cash equivalents as disclosed in note 12. The Group regularly explores options to optimise its debt capital structure. As part of this, in order to reduce interest costs, extend maturities and diversify finance sources, the Group will continue to monitor the availability of various financing options. Opportunities are evaluated in light of prevailing market conditions, taking into account current liquidity, available terms, execution risks and prospects for future access to capital. ###### 14. Derivative financial instruments As described above, the Group makes extensive use of derivative financial instruments for the purpose of managing its exposure to the risks set out in note 13. Where possible, the Group has taken advantage of the own-use exemption which allows qualifying contracts to be excluded from fair value mark-to-market accounting. This applies to certain contracts for physical commodities entered into and held for our own purchase, sale or usage requirements, including forward contracts for the purchase of ROCs and coal from domestic sources. Contracts which do not qualify for the own-use exemption and which can be settled net in cash or another financial instrument – principally power, gas, financial oil, financial coal, CO2 emissions allowances, interest rate and inflation s aps and for ard foreign c rrenc e change contracts are acco nted for as deri ati es in accordance ith IFRS 9 ----- and are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value (which is the difference between the price we have secured in the contract and the price we could achieve in the market at the balance sheet date). Changes in fair value are recognised in the hedge reserve (note 16) to the extent that the contracts are designated as effective hedges in accordance with IFRS 9, or the income statement where the hedge accounting requirements are not met. Where changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement, they are excluded from the Group’s Adjusted Results, as described in the basis of preparation. The Group enters into forward contracts solely for the purpose of financial risk management and considers all of its contracts to be economic hedges (or components of a wider strategy to fix target prices), regardless of whether or not the specific criteria for hedge accounting are met. For financial reporting purposes, the Group has classified derivative financial instruments into five categories: - Commodity contracts – forward contracts for the sale or purchase of a physical commodity which is expected to be settled through physical delivery of the commodity. - Financial contracts – freight and weather-related contracts, as well as contracts for commodities that are not expected to be settled through physical delivery of the commodity. - Forward currency exchange contracts – currency related contracts including forwards, vanilla options and structured option products. - Interest rate swaps – contracts which swap one interest rate for another, including floating-to-fixed single currency instruments and cross-currency interest rate swaps. - Inflation rate swaps – swap contracts, such as floating-to-fixed, which are linked to an inflation index such as RPI or CPI.

The fair value of the rebased trades is recognised on the rebased rates, resulting in a reduction in the value of derivative financial instruments recognised. However, the gains relating to the cash received from rebasing are deferred from Adjusted Results until the contracts mature. The change in fair value of the derivative portfolio in the period has been driven predominantly by changes in currency exchange rates and power prices. The Group has a large portfolio of forward currency contracts which fix the sterling cost of our future fuel purchases denominated in foreign currencies. Given the size of the portfolio, the fair value is highly sensitive to small changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

The fair values of all derivative financial instruments are discounted to reflect the credit risk inherent within the instrument. Categorisation within this fair value measurement hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset or liability. The fair values of commodity contracts and financial contracts are largely determined by comparison of observable forward market prices with the contract price; therefore, these contracts are categorised at Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 13. The Group holds certain derivative contracts with unobservable, and therefore Level 3, inputs (principally the CPI component of inflation swaps). However, in each case, these inputs are not material to the overall valuation and therefore the instruments as a whole are determined to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. ###### 15.

As at 30 June 2020, the Group’s contingent liability in respect of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility amounted to £35.6 million (as at 31 December 2019: £77.0 million). The Group also guarantees obligations in the form of surety bonds with a number of insurers. As at 30 June 2020 the Group’s contingent liability in relation to these guarantees was £95.7 million (as at 31 December 2019: £96.1 million). ###### 19. Prior period restatements As described in the basis of preparation, the 30 June 2019 balance sheet has been restated in respect of the following items: x During the second half of 2019, the acquisition date fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in the purchase of the portfolio of hydro, pumped storage and gas assets on 31 December 2018 were finalised. As a result, finalisation of the terms of the defined benefit pension scheme transfer resulted in a reduction in the net opening surplus recognised by £1.1 million. The finalisation of the Group’s assessment of CGUs and their fair values resulted in a net £0.2 million reduction in property, plant and equipment values and a £0.1 million reduction in deferred tax liabilities recognised. All of these adjustments had corresponding impacts on goodwill. x To reflect the correction of a historical error identified during the second half of 2019 in respect of the translation of fixed assets in the US-based business into the consolidated Group financial statements. Application of the correct foreign exchange rates resulted in an increase in property, plant and equipment carrying values as at 30 June 2019 and 1 January 2019 of £56.6 million and £55.5 million, respectively. As a result, other comprehensive income for the six months ended 30 June 2019 has also been restated by £1.1 million to reflect the additional movement in the translation reserve. The correction has no impact on previously reported profit or cash amounts. x The Group rebased a number of forward foreign currency contracts in 2019. This released cash from the contracts with the gains being held on the balance sheet until the contracts mature. At 30 June 2019, the balance sheet included £42.9 million of such cash received from rebasing where the relating contracts had not yet matured and which was held in deferred income on the balance sheet. This was the first reporting period in which cash had been received from the rebasing of contracts, but the contracts had not yet matured. In the Group’s 2019 Annual Report and Accounts the balance sheet presentation of the cash received was amended h th t th th th f i l f th b d t t b i b d th b d t d h ----- received being recognised as deferred income, the fair value of the rebased contracts are recognised based on the rebased rates and no deferred income is recognised. Accordingly, the 30 June 2019 comparatives have been restated to align with the application of the policy used in the Group’s 2019 Annual Report and Accounts. This has resulted in a £42.9 million reduction in derivative assets and a £42.9 million reduction in deferred income in the 30 June 2019 balance sheet. The impact on the previously reported amounts in the balance sheet as at 30 June 2019 and the statement of comprehensive income for the six months to 30 June 2019, due to the above restatements, are set out in the tables below.

74_1,Offerings 2020.md,1270,INDEPENDENT REVIEW REPORT TO DRAX GROUP PLC,1270.6,Audited consolidated financial statements of Drax Group plc and its subsidiaries as of and for the year ended 31 December 2019,1270.6.1,,"Extracted from the 2019 annual report and accounts of Drax Group plc ----- ### Independent Auditor’s Report #### to the Members of Drax Group plc Report on the audit of the financial statements 1. Opinion In our opinion: - the financial statements of Drax Group plc (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘group’) give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2019 and of the group’s profit for the year then ended; - the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union; - the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, including Financial Reporting Standard 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”; and - the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We have audited the financial statements which comprise: - the consolidated income statement; - the consolidated statement of comprehensive income; - the consolidated and parent company balance sheets; - the consolidated and parent company statements of changes in equity; - the consolidated cash flow statement; - the basis of preparation and statement of accounting policies on pages 129 to 131; - the notes 2.1 to 8.4 related to the consolidated financial statements; and - the notes 1 to 9 related to the parent company financial statements. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework” (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). 2. Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council’s (the ‘FRC’s’) Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. The non-audit services provided to the Group for the year are disclosed in note 2.3 to the financial statements. We confirm that the non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the group or the parent company. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 3. Summary of our audit approach Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were: - Valuation of commodity, foreign exchange and other contracts - Estimation of Customers unbilled revenue - Impairment of OCGT development assets Within this report, key audit matters are identified as follows: !** Newly identified Increased level of risk Similar level of risk Decreased level of risk Materiality The materiality that we used for the Group financial statements was £12.2m which was determined on the basis of taking into consideration a number of metrics, but with particular focus on Earnings before Interest, Taxation, Depreciation and Amortisation (Adjusted EBITDA) which excludes the impact of exceptional items and certain remeasurements. Our selected materiality represents approximately 3% of Adjusted EBITDA for the year. Scoping We focused our Group audit scope primarily on the audit work at four components, being Drax Generation, Haven Power Opus Energy and Drax Biomass These components represent the principal business units and account for ----- ### Independent Auditor’s Report #### to the members of Drax Group plc continued Significant changes in The following changes were made to the key audit matters reported in the prior year: [of ][t][h][e ][c][o][n][s][o][l][i][d][a][t][e][d][ income ] [s][t][a][t][e][m][e][n][t][ covering ] [b][o][t][h][ e][x][c][e][p][t][i][o][n][a][l] [i][t][e][m][s][ and ][c][e][r][t][a][i][n] our approach [• ] [The ][p][r][e][s][e][n][t][a][t][i][o][n] remeasurements was a key audit matter in 2018 as this was the first year in which the consolidated income statement was presented in this way. This was a one off key audit matter to reflect this significant change in presentation and therefore has been removed as a key audit matter in the current year. - The accounting for the acquisition of Drax Generation Enterprise Limited is no longer a key audit matter. This was a prior year one-off acquisition and there have been no significant changes in the finalisation of the purchase price allocation in the current year, see Note 5.1. - Impairment of OCGT development assets has been identified as a key audit matter in the current year. This reflects the delay in securing a capacity market contract which would facilitate continued development of the projects. Other aspects of our audit approach remain broadly consistent with the prior year. 4. Conclusions relating to going concern, principal risks and viability statement 4.1. Going concern We have reviewed the directors’ statement on page 129 to the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them and their identification of any material uncertainties to the group’s and company’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements. We considered as part of our risk assessment the nature of the group, its business model and related risks including where relevant the impact of Brexit, the requirements of the applicable financial reporting framework and the system of internal control. We evaluated the directors’ assessment of the group’s ability to continue as a going concern, including challenging the underlying data and key assumptions used to make the assessment, and evaluated the directors’ plans for future actions in relation to their going concern assessment. We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to that statement required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) and report if the statement is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit. 4.2. Principal risks and viability statement Based solely on reading the directors’ statements and considering whether they were consistent with the knowledge we obtained in the course of the audit, including the knowledge obtained in the evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the group’s and the company’s ability to continue as a going concern, we are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to: - the disclosures on pages 54 to 61 that describe the principal risks, procedures to identify emerging risks, and an explanation of how these are being managed or mitigated; - the directors’ confirmation on page 55 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal and emerging risks facing the group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity; or - the directors’ explanation on pages 52 and 53 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions. We are also required to report whether the directors’ statement relating to the prospects of the group required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit. Going concern is the basis of preparation of the financial statements that assumes an entity will remain in operation for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements. We confirm that we have nothing material to report, add or draw attention to in respect of these matters. Viability means the ability of the group to continue over the time horizon considered appropriate by the directors. We confirm that we have nothing material to report, add or draw attention to in respect of these matters. ----- 122 [Drax Group plc Annual ] [repor][t][ and ][accounts ][2][0][1][9] ----- 5. Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 5.1. Valuation of commodity, foreign exchange and other contracts Key audit matter description How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter Key observations Net losses on derivative contracts recognised in the Consolidated income statement in the year are £132.8m (2018: gains of £38.4m), with related derivative assets of £346.0m and liabilities of £289.4m recognised on the balance sheet as at 31 December 2019. Further detail of the key judgements are disclosed in the Audit Committee report on pages 82 and 83. Section 7 sets out the financial risk management notes. The Group has exposure to a number of different financial risks including foreign exchange risk and commodity risk, and use a variety of derivative contracts to mitigate these risks, including commodity contracts, floating swap forwards and cross currency swaps. The valuation of derivative contracts is complex and requires judgement in areas including the selection of appropriate valuation methodologies, and assumptions in respect of future market prices and credit risk factors. Due to the inherent risks as described above, the large volume of data involved in the contract valuations, the complex valuation methodologies applied, and the requirement for certain manual adjustments, we have identified a risk relating to the potential for management or employees of the company to value trades inappropriately. We evaluated the design and implementation and tested the operating effectiveness of relevant controls related to the valuation of commodity and foreign exchange contracts. With involvement of our internal financial instrument specialists we tested management’s key judgements and calculations, including testing a sample of trades undertaken to trade tickets, confirming key contractual terms such as volumes and contracted prices. We have assessed the valuation models used by management, including any manual adjustments to determine the fair value of the derivative instruments and performed independent valuations across a sample of both commodity and foreign exchange contracts. We have analysed the appropriateness of management’s forward price curve assumptions by benchmarking these to third party sources and reviewed the consistency of the assumptions used across other areas of the financial statements, such as asset impairment, where relevant. We have challenged management’s approach and assumptions involved in assessing fair value adjustments such as credit risk, time value of money and spread adjustments through consideration of third party data. From our testing, we are satisfied that the valuation of commodity and foreign exchange contracts is reasonable. We consider the valuation models used by management to be appropriate and the forward curve assumptions adopted are within an acceptable range. 5.2. Estimation of Customers unbilled revenue Key audit matter description The recognition of retail revenue requires an estimation of customer usage between the date of the last meter reading and year end, which is known as unbilled revenue. Across the Customers division, unbilled revenue at the balance sheet date amounted to £207.6m (2018: £146.5m). Further detail of the key judgements are disclosed in the Group’s critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions set out on page 130 and the Audit Committee report on pages 82 and 83. Accrued income is disclosed in note 3.6. The method of estimating unbilled revenue is complex and judgemental and requires assumptions for both the volumes of energy consumed by customers and the related value. We identified a potential fraud risk in relation to revenue recognition in the Customer businesses, in particular to the estimates underpinning unbilled revenue, as these judgemental areas could be manipulated by management to mis-report revenue. ----- ### Independent Auditor’s Report #### to the members of Drax Group plc continued How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter Key observations We evaluated the design and implementation and tested the operating effectiveness of relevant controls related to the estimation of unbilled revenue. This included controls over the reconciliation of meter readings provided by the energy markets, and which are used by management to estimate the power supplied. We also tested the controls over the price per unit applied in the valuation of unbilled revenue. When external market information was not available at the balance sheet date, we obtained and considered management’s reconciliation of the volume of power purchased to their calculations of revenue supplied and completed sample tests to check that the December 2019 unbilled revenue amount was subsequently billed. We also reviewed the aggregate unbilled revenue balance from previous periods to test that the amounts recognised were subsequently billed in line with the values accrued. Our retrospective reviews of estimated revenues found that management have historically achieved a high level of accuracy. We considered the estimates for revenue earned in the year to be appropriate. 5.3 Impairment of OCGT development assets **! Key audit matter description How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter Key observations An asset of £41.9m (2018: £36.1m) is recognised within the Consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2019 in relation to development assets for OCGT projects. Continued development, construction and operation of these assets is ultimately dependent upon the ability to secure sufficient future income at an appropriate level in order to reduce the project risk and associated returns to an acceptable level. Further detail of the key judgements are disclosed in the Group’s critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions set out on page 130 and the Audit Committee report on pages 82 and 83. Intangible assets are disclosed in note 5.3. The business case for these projects is predicated on the ability to secure a Capacity Market contract at an appropriate level. Current clearing prices are noted to be below the levels required for further development of these projects and a risk has been identified in respect of the recoverable value of these assets. Estimating the recoverable value of these assets requires judgement in relation to key assumptions including discount rates, future income levels and capital costs. We note that assumptions relating to long term revenues and costs are inherently difficult to assess. We note that the headroom calculated is highly sensitive to all key assumptions and any future negative changes would be expected to result in an impairment charge. We evaluated the design and implementation of relevant controls in relation to management’s impairment assessment process. We have reviewed management’s models and challenged the key assumptions including discount rates, income assumptions and capital costs. We have benchmarked income assumptions against third party reports prepared by reputable market analysts and worked with internal valuation specialists to prepare an independent assessment of discount rates. We have challenged management over the appropraiteness of capital cost assumptions in light of asset specifications and procurement strategies for the project. We have undertaken analysis and testing including; - Running a range of sensitivities including alternative scenarios to assess whether an impairment would be required if other assumptions were adopted; - Verifying the mathematical accuracy of the cash flow models; and - Assessing whether the disclosures in note 5.3 of the financial statements appropriately disclose the key judgements taken so that the reader of the accounts is aware of the impact in the financial statements of changes to key assumptions that may lead to impairment. We believe that the assumptions used by management were appropriate and supported by third party independent assessments. Discount rates applied by management are considered to be lower than expected for projects of this nature which would be expected to be in the range of 7.5% - 8.0% compared to management’s assumption of 7.0%. Based on alternative scenarios we are satisfied that no impairment is required. ----- 6. Our application of materiality 6.1. Materiality We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work. Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows: Group financial statements Parent company financial statements Materiality £12.2m (2018: £7.6m) £5.6m (2018: £4.6m) We have capped materiality at 46% (2018: 60%) of the materiality identified for the Group. This is a judgement and reflects the significant value of investments held on the balance sheet at the year end (£719.7m). Parent company materiality equates to 0.8% of net assets (2018: 0.7%). When determining materiality, we considered the net assets of the company as its principal activity is as an investment holding company for the Group. Group materiality £12m Basis for determining materiality Rationale for the benchmark applied We have determined materiality by considering a range of possible benchmarks but with a particular focus on Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the impact of exceptional items and certain measurements, together with profit before and after interest and tax as well as the scale of the balance sheet and the overall size of the business. Our selected materiality represents approximately 3.0% of Adjusted EBITDA for the year (2018: 3.0%) the basis of which is consistent with the prior year. When determining materiality, we have considered the size and scale of the business and the nature of its operations. We have also considered which benchmarks would be of relevance to the users of the financial statements and those applied to the audit of similar businesses. We consider that Adjusted EBITDA is of particular relevance to users of the financial statements and is a key measure of performance used by the Group. It excludes volatility caused in particular by the remeasurements of derivative contracts and exceptional items, defined as those transactions that, by their nature, do not reflect the trading performance of the Group in the period. Adjusted EBITDA Group materiality Adjusted EBITDA £410m Component materiality range £6m to £4m Audit Committee reporting threshold £0.60m 6.2. Performance materiality We set performance materiality at a level lower than materiality to reduce the probability that, in aggregate, uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceed the materiality for the financial statements as a whole. Group performance materiality was set at 70% of group materiality for the 2019 audit (2018: 70%). In determining performance materiality, we considered the following factors: - The low level of historical uncorrected misstatements within the consolidated financial statements; - Our assessment of the control environment and conclusions from our testing of group wide controls; and - No significant changes in the business in the year which would impact on our ability to forecast expected level of misstatement ----- F-40 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2019 125 ----- ### Independent Auditor’s Report #### to the members of Drax Group plc continued 6.3. Error reporting threshold We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £0.6m (2018: £0.4m), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements. 7. An overview of the scope of our audit 7.1. Identification and scoping of components Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including group-wide controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. We focused our Group audit scope primarily on the audit work at four components, being Drax Generation, Haven Power, Opus Energy and Drax Biomass. These represent the principal business units of the Group and account for virtually all of the Group’s net assets, revenue and profit before tax. This is in line with our audit approach from the prior year. All work was performed by the UK audit team under the supervision of the Senior Statutory Auditor. No component or overseas auditors were engaged in the completion of our audit procedures in the current or prior year. A full scope audit was performed for all significant components. This scope was selected to provide an appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement identified above. Our audit work at all significant component locations was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity which were lower than Group materiality and ranged from £4.0m to £6.0m (2018: £3.0m to £5.3m). At the Group level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject to audit or audit of specified account balances. During 2019 and subsequently the Senior Statutory Auditor visited the primary locations for all four significant components. 8. Other information The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. In this context, matters that we are specifically required to report to you as uncorrected material misstatements of the other information include where we conclude that: - Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the directors that they consider the annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the group’s position and performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or - Audit committee reporting – the section describing the work of the audit committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the audit committee; or - Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code – the parts of the directors’ statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the company’s compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to report in respect of these matters. 9. Responsibilities of directors As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no ----- 10. Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. Details of the extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations are set out below. A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: [www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description](http://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities) forms part of our auditor’s report. 11. Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and then design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, including obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 11.1. Identifying and assessing potential risks related to irregularities In identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations, we considered the following: - the nature of the industry and sector, control environment and business performance including the design of the Group’s remuneration policies, key drivers for directors’ remuneration, bonus levels and performance targets; - the Group’s own assessment of the risks that irregularities may occur either as a result of fraud or error; - results of our enquiries of management, internal audit and the audit committee about their own identification and assessment of the risks of irregularities; - any matters we identified having obtained and reviewed the Group’s documentation of their policies and procedures relating to: – identifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any instances of non compliance; – detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud; – the internal controls established to mitigate risks of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations; - the matters discussed among the audit engagement team and involving relevant internal specialists, including tax, pensions, IT and financial instrument specialists regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and any potential indicators of fraud. As a result of these procedures, we considered the opportunities and incentives that may exist within the organisation for fraud and identified the greatest potential for fraud in the following areas: impairment of OCGT development assets, cut-off of bilateral sales, working capital transactions and estimation of Customers unbilled revenue. In common with all audits under ISAs (UK), we are also required to perform specific procedures to respond to the risk of management override. We also obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework that the Group operates in, focusing on provisions of those laws and regulations that had a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The key laws and regulations we considered in this context included the UK Companies Act, Listing Rules, Pensions legislation, Tax legislation, and Regulations established by regulators in the key markets in which the Group operates, including the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem). In addition, we considered provisions of other laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the financial statements but compliance with which may be fundamental to the Group’s ability to operate or to avoid a material penalty. These included the operating and environmental regulations relevant to the Group. 11.2. Audit response to risks identified As a result of performing the above, we identified impairment of OCGT development assets and estimation of Customers unbilled revenue as key audit matters related to the potential risk of fraud. The key audit matters section of our report explains the matters in more detail and also describes the specific procedures we performed in response to those key audit matters. In addition to the above our procedures to respond to risks identified included the following: - reviewing the financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with provisions of relevant laws and regulations described above as having a direct effect on the financial statements; - enquiring of management, the audit committee and in-house legal counsel concerning actual and potential litigation and claims; - performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of material misstatement due to fraud; - reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance, reviewing internal audit reports and reviewing correspondence ----- ### Independent Auditor’s Report #### to the members of Drax Group plc continued - in addressing the risk of fraud in revenue recognition and cut-off of bilateral sales, in addition to our testing described above we have performed focussed testing on trades close to the year end combined with analytical review procedures to assess accuracy and completeness of revenue recognised; - in addressing the risk of fraud in the use of working capital transactions, we have challenged management on the rationale for all transactions entered into and reviewed the accounting treatments adopted by management against the specific contractual terms and arrangements associated with each individual transaction and reviewed the related disclosures in the financial statements; and - in addressing the risk of fraud through management override of controls, testing the appropriateness of journal entries and other adjustments; assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias; and evaluating the business rationale of any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business. We also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement team members including internal specialists, and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations throughout the audit. Report on other legal and regulatory requirementss 12. Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 In our opinion the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: - the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and - the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report. 13. Matters on which we are required to report by exception 13.1 Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: - we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or - adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or - the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. We have nothing to report in respect of these matters. 13.2 Directors’ remuneration Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration have not been made or the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. We have nothing to report in respect of these matters. 14. Other matters 14.1 Auditor tenure Following the recommendation of the audit committee, we were appointed by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 17 April 2019 to audit the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2019 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and reappointments of the firm is 15 years, covering the years ending 31 December 2005 to 2019. 14.2 Consistency of the audit report with the additional report to the audit committee Our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the audit committee we are required to provide in accordance with ISAs (UK). 15. Use of our report This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. Anthony Matthews FCA (Senior statutory auditor) For and on behalf of Deloitte LLP Statutory Auditor London, United Kingdom ----- #### Financial statements ###### Introduction The consolidated financial statements provide detailed information about the financial performance (Consolidated income statement), financial position (Consolidated balance sheet), and cash flows (Consolidated cash flow statement) of Drax Group plc (the Company) together with all of the entities controlled by the Company (collectively, the Group). The notes to the financial statements provide additional information on the items in the Consolidated income statement, Consolidated balance sheet and Consolidated cash flow statement. The notes include explanations of the information presented. In general, the additional information in the notes to the financial statements is required by law, International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) or other regulations to facilitate increased understanding of the primary statements set out on pages 133-137. Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and therefore the consolidated financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation and the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value (principally derivative financial instruments) and the assets and liabilities of the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes (measured at fair value and using the projected unit credit method respectively). Restatement of the 2018 financial statements The Group provides comparative financial information in these financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018. The financial information provided in respect of 2018 has been restated for the following two matters: - The balance sheet for 2018 has been restated to reflect updated values for assets and liabilities acquired in relation to the acquisition of Drax Generation Enterprise Limited (formerly ScottishPower Generation Limited – see note 5.1) following conclusion of the completion statement process and finalisation of acquisition fair values during 2019. The new portfolio of pumped storage, hydro and CCGT generation assets are hereafter referred to as “the new generation assets.” - The balance sheet for 2018 has also been restated to correct a historical error in the application of foreign exchange rates to the translation of fixed asset balances in the Group’s overseas subsidiaries. Correction of this error resulted in a £55.5 million increase in fixed asset carrying values and the balance of the translation reserve at 31 December 2018, with no impact on the Consolidated income statement or the Consolidated cash flow statement. See note 8.3 for further details. As this adjustment impacts the opening balance sheet for 2018, a restated balance sheet for 2017 has also been provided, as required by IAS 1. Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date monetary assets and liabilities that are Foreign exchange gains and losses arising on such retranslations are recognised in the consolidated income statement within foreign exchange (losses)/gains. Foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations with a functional currency other than sterling are translated into sterling using published exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenditure of such operations are translated into sterling using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the retranslation of the operation’s net assets and its results for the year are recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Going concern The Group’s business activities, along with future developments that may affect its financial performance, position and cash flows, are discussed within the Strategic report on pages 1 to 61 of this Annual Report. In the viability statement on page 52-53 the directors state that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the next three years. Consequently, the directors also have a reasonable expectation that the Group will continue in existence for the next 12 months and, therefore, have adopted the going concern basis in preparing these financial statements. Basis of consolidation These consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial results of the Company and of all entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. The Company owns 100% of the equity of all subsidiaries. Accounting policies The significant accounting policies for the measurement of an individual item in the financial statements are described in the note to the financial statements relating to the item concerned (see contents on page 132). The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the Group’s annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018, except for the adoption of new standards effective as of 1 January 2019. In addition, the Group has early-adopted the amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 17: Interest rate benchmark reform. The Group has not early-adopted any other standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective. A full listing of new standards, interpretations and pronouncements under IFRS applicable to these financial statements is presented in note 8.2. The application of these new requirements has not had a material effect on the financial statements, other than in respect of IFRS 16. ----- #### Financial statements continued Adoption of IFRS 16 (Leases) IFRS 16 supersedes IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease, SIC 15 Operating leases and SIC 27 Evaluating the substance of transactions involving the legal form of a lease. The Group has adopted IFRS 16 from 1 January 2019 using the modified retrospective method of adoption. Under this method, the standard is applied retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognised at the date of initial application. Consequently, comparative information in these financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018 has not been restated. The new requirements have impacted the Group’s accounting for lease contracts. The Group’s lease portfolio predominantly relates to properties and the hire of plant and equipment at operating sites. On transition to IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019, assets controlled under lease contracts were brought onto the balance sheet as right-of-use assets, and the Group has recognised a corresponding liability for the amounts payable under the lease contracts. On transition, the Group elected to use the available practical expedient allowing the standard to only be applied to those contracts identified as leases under the previous standards. Accordingly, the definition of a lease in accordance with IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 will continue to apply to those leases entered into or modified before 1 January 2019. However, the Group has applied the new definition of a lease to all contracts entered into or modified on or after 1 January 2019. This change did not have a significant impact on the assessment of new contracts in 2019 that are in scope of the new definition of a lease. See note 8.3 on page 204 Judgements and estimates The preparation of financial statements requires judgement to be applied in forming the Group’s accounting policies. It also requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, with revisions recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. The judgements involving a higher degree of estimation or complexity are set out below and in more detail, including sensitivity analysis where appropriate, in the related notes. Critical accounting judgements The critical judgements made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies during the year that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are set out below. Certain remeasurements and exceptional items – management makes judgements regarding transactions to exclude from the Adjusted Results of the Group, as described under Alternative Performance Measures, below. See note 2.7 on page 149 Sources of estimation uncertainty The following are the sources of estimation uncertainty that carry the most significant risk of a material effect on next year’s accounts – that is, the items where actual outcomes in the next 12 months could vary significantly from the estimates made in determining the reported amount of an asset or liability. Property, plant and equipment – property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life. Useful economic lives are estimated and based on past experience, future replacement cycles and other available evidence. Useful economic lives are reviewed annually. The carrying value of property, plant and equipment at 31 December 2019 is £2,327.4 million and depreciation on these assets in the year, based on the weighted average useful economic lives disclosed in note 3.1, was £159.0 million. See note 3.1 on page 152 Impairment – an impairment review is conducted annually of goodwill and of other assets and cash-generating units (CGUs) where an indicator of possible impairment exists. In 2019, an impairment assessment has been completed for five of the Group’s CGUs which have allocated goodwill or intangible assets with an indefinite life. The assessment of future cash flows that underpins such a review is based on management’s best estimate of retail margins, future commodity prices, supply volumes, the capacity market and economic conditions. See note 2.4 on page 143, note 5.2 on page 170 and note 5.3 on page 171 Revenue recognition – the nature of some of the Group’s activities, particularly within the Customers segment, results in revenue being based on the estimated volumes of power supplied to customers between the last meter reading and the year end, at an estimated average price per unit. Assumptions that underpin these estimates are applied consistently and comparison of past estimates to final settlements suggests a high degree of accuracy. However, actual outcomes may vary from initial estimates. Revenue from contracts satisfied over time is recognised in line with the progress of those contracts. Assumptions are applied consistently but actual outcomes may vary from initial estimates. The value of revenue recognised by the Group in the period to 31 December 2019 in relation to the Customer business is £2,269.1 million. See note 2.2 on page 140 ----- Pensions – the Group records a net surplus or liability in its balance sheet for its obligation to provide benefits under approved defined benefit pension schemes, less the fair value of assets held by the pension schemes. The actuarial valuations of the schemes’ assets and liabilities are performed annually and depends on assumptions regarding interest rates, inflation, future salary and pension increases, mortality and other factors, any of which are subject to future change. One of the key estimations within the valuations is the discount rate. The value of the pension surplus recognised by the Group at 31 December 2019 is £7.0 million. Sensitivities in the valuations are discussed in note 6.3. See note 6.3 on page 179 Taxation – in accounting for both current and deferred tax the Group makes assumptions regarding the likely treatment of items of income and expenditure for tax purposes and the recoverability of deferred tax assets. These assumptions are based on interpretation of relevant legislation and, where required, consultation with external advisers. The Group makes assumptions on whether it is appropriate to recognise deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets are recognised when it is considered more likely than not that they will be recovered. The key assumption for the Group is in relation to the likelihood of sufficient future taxable profits in its US business to utilise tax losses. The Group has recognised deferred tax assets in relation to these losses and other temporary differences at 31 December 2019 of £27.5 million. See note 2.6 on page 145 Alternative performance measures (APMs) The measures described below are not measures that are defined within IFRS but provide additional information that is used by the Board to evaluate the Group’s trading performance. These measures have been defined internally and may therefore not be comparable to similar APMs presented by other companies. Presentation of the income statement The Group’s financial performance for the period, measured in accordance with IFRS, is shown in the Total Results column on the face of the income statement. Exceptional items and certain remeasurements are deducted from the Total Results in arriving at the Adjusted Results for the year. The Group’s Adjusted Results are consistent with the way executive management and the Board assess the performance of the Group. Adjusted Results are intended to reflect the underlying trading performance of the Group’s businesses and are presented to assist users of the accounts in evaluating the Group’s trading performance and performance against strategic objectives, Exceptional items are those transactions that, by their nature, do not reflect the trading performance of the Group in the period. For a transaction to be considered exceptional, management considers the nature of the transaction, the frequency of similar events, previous precedent and commercial context. Exceptional items are approved by the Audit Committee. Certain remeasurements comprise fair value gains and losses on derivative forward contracts to the extent those contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, or hedge accounting is not effective, which under IFRS are recorded in revenue, cost of sales or foreign exchange gains/(losses) as described above. The Group regards all of its forward contracting activity to represent an economic hedge. The impact of excluding these fair value remeasurements is to reflect commodity sales and purchases at contracted prices (the price paid or received in respect of delivery of the commodity in question), taking into account the impact of financial trading (such as forward foreign currency purchases), in the Adjusted Results. The result of this adjustment shows the impact in revenue, cost of sales and foreign exchange gains/(losses) at the time the transaction takes place. Further information on exceptional items and certain remeasurements in the current and previous period is included in note 2.7 to the financial statements. The Group presents an additional subtotal in the Adjusted Results column. Adjusted EBITDA is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, excluding the impact of exceptional items and certain remeasurements. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by executive management and the Board to assess the financial performance of the Group as it provides a more comparable assessment of the Group’s year on year trading performance. Adjusted EBITDA for 2019 does not include the expense for contracts classified as operating leases under previous accounting standards. Under the new accounting standard of IFRS 16, leases are capitalised on the balance sheet as right-ofuse assets with depreciation charged to the income statement over the assets’ useful economic life. The impact of IFRS 16 on Adjusted EBITDA is a £7.4 million benefit due to the reduction in operating expenses, see note 8.3 for further information. Net debt The Group defines net debt as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents. Total borrowings includes external financial debt, such as loan notes, term loans and amounts drawn in cash under revolving credit facilities (see note 4.3) but excludes other financial liabilities such as lease liabilities calculated in accordance with IFRS 16 (see note 3.2), pension obligations and trade and other payables. The Group does not include lease liabilities, calculated in accordance with IFRS 16, in the definition of net debt. This reflects the nature of the contracts included in this balance which were previously not held on the balance sheet and disclosed as operating commitments in the Group’s 2018 Annual Report and Accounts. At 31 December 2019, these liabilities had a carrying amount of £32.5 million (see note 3.2). The 2018 calculation of net debt includes the amounts payable under finance lease liabilities. In 2019, these liabilities have been included with lease liabilities under IFRS 16 and therefore excluded from the net debt calculation. The carrying amount of finance lease liabilities at 31 December 2018 was £0.5 million and has therefore not had a material impact on the net debt comparison with the previous year ----- #### Financial statements contents Section 1 ###### Consolidated financial statements Section 5 ###### Other assets and liabilities 133 Consolidated income statement 169 5.1 Acquisitions 134 Consolidated statement of comprehensive income 170 5.2 Goodwill 135 Consolidated balance sheet 171 5.3 Intangible assets 136 Consolidated statement of changes in equity 174 5.4 Provisions 137 Consolidated cash flow statement Section 2 ###### Financial performance 138 2.1  Segmental reporting 140 2.2 Revenue 142 2.3 Operating expenses 143 2.4 Review of fixed assets for impairment 144 2.5 Net finance costs 145 2.6 Current and deferred taxation Section 6 ###### Our people 175 6.1  Employees and directors 175 6.2 Share-based payments 179 6.3 Retirement benefit obligations Section 7 ###### Risk management 149 2.7 Certain remeasurements and exceptional items 185 7.1 Financial instruments and their fair values 150 2.8 Earnings per share 189 7.2 Financial risk management 150 2.9 Dividends 199 7.3 Hedge reserve 151  2.10 Retained profits 200 7.4 Cost of hedging reserve 201 7.5 Offsetting financial assets and liabilities Section 3 202 7.6 Contingent assets and liabilities ###### Operating assets and working capital 152 3.1 Property, plant and equipment 155 3.2 Leases 156 3.3 Other fixed asset investments 157 3.4 ROC assets 158 3.5 Inventories 159 3.6 Trade and other receivables 161 3.7 Contract costs 161 3.8 Trade and other payables Section 4 ###### Financing and capital structure 163 4.1 Reconciliation of net debt 163 4.2 Cash and cash equivalents 163 4.3 Borrowings 166 4.4 Notes to the consolidated cash flow statement 167 4.5 Equity and reserves 202 7.7  Commitments Section 8 ###### Reference information 203 8.1  General information 203 8.2 Basis of preparation 204 8.3 Adoption of new accounting standards and restatement of previously reported financial statements 208 8.4 Related party transactions ###### Drax Group plc 209 Company financial statements 211  Notes to the Company financial statements ----- F-47 132 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2019 ----- #### Section 1: Consolidated financial statements Consolidated income statement Year ended 31 December 2019 Year ended 31 December 2018 |Col1|Exceptional items and certain Adjusted remeasure- Results(1) ments Notes £m £m|Exceptional items and certain Total Adjusted remeasure- Results Results(1) ments £m £m £m|Total Results £m| |---|---|---|---| Revenue 2.2 4,702.9 10.5 4,713.4 4,237.3 (8.3) 4,229.0 Cost of sales (3,835.8) (143.3) (3,979.1) (3,636.3) 46.7 (3,589.6) Gross profit 867.1 (132.8) 734.3 601.0 38.4 639.4 Operating and administrative expenses 2.3 (439.3) – (439.3) (320.0) – (320.0) Adjusted Impairment EBITDAlosses on [(2) ] financial assets 3.6 40(189..80) – (18.0) 24(391..64) – (31.4) Depreciation 3.1 (165.9) – (165.9) (129.2) – (129.2) Amortisation 5.3 (42.0) – (42.0) (44.6) – (44.6) Asset obsolescence charges 2.7 – – – – (26.8) (26.8) Losses on disposals 3.1 (1.2) – (1.2) (3.9) – (3.9) Other gains/(losses) 3.1 – 3.1 4.1 – 4.1 Acquisition and restructuring costs[(3)] 2.7 – (9.0) (9.0) – (27.7) (27.7) Operating profit/(loss) 203.8 (141.8) 62.0 76.0 (16.1) 59.9 Foreign exchange (losses)/gains 2.5 (1.6) 2.0 0.4 0.3 – 0.3 Interest payable and similar charges[(4][)] 2.5 (61.3) (5.2) (66.5) (40.4) (7.2) (47.6) Interest receivable 2.5 1.3 – 1.3 1.2 – 1.2 Profit/(loss) before tax 142.2 (145.0) (2.8) 37.1 (23.3) 13.8 Tax: – Before effect of changes in tax rate 2.6 (22.3) 27.4 5.1 0.2 1.6 1.8 – Prior year patent box credit 2.6 – – – 4.8 – 4.8 – Effect of changes in tax rate 2.6 (1.8) – (1.8) (0.2) – (0.2) Total tax (charge)/credit (24.1) 27.4 3.3 4.8 1.6 6.4 Profit/(loss) for the year attributable to equity holders 118.1 (117.6) 0.5 41.9 (21.7) 20.2 Earnings/(loss) per share Pence Pence Pence Pence – Basic 2.8 29.9 0.1 10.4 5.0 – Diluted 2.8 29.7 0.1 10.3 4.9 All results relate to continuing operations.

During the first half of 2019, the completion statement process in respect of the acquisition has been concluded and the Group made a further payment in accordance with the terms of the acquisition of £4.8 million which was settled on 14 May 2019. There were no material non-cash transactions in either the current or previous year. The Group recorded a net loss of £117.6 million (2018: net loss £21.7 million) arising on exceptional items and certain remeasurements in the Consolidated income statement in 2019. Acquisition and restructuring costs of £9.0 million (2018: £27.7 million) are included in cash generated from operations (see note 4.4) and cash paid in respect of debt restructuring of £5.2 million (2018: £2.0 million) in cash used in financing activities. All other exceptional items and remeasurements are non-cash and adjusted in the reconciliation shown in note 4.4. ----- Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2019  137 ----- #### Section 2: Financial performance The financial performance section gives further information about the items in the Consolidated income statement. It includes a summary of financial performance by each of the Group’s businesses (see note 2.1), analysis of certain income statement items (notes 2.2–2.6) and information regarding the Adjusted and Total Results, dividends and distributable profits (notes 2.7–2.10). Further commentary on the Group’s trading and operational performance during the year, which is predominantly reflected in Adjusted EBITDA, can be found in the Strategic report on pages 1 to 61, with particular reference to key transactions and market conditions that have affected the results. 2.1 Segmental reporting The Group is organised into three businesses, with a dedicated management team for each, and a central corporate office providing certain specialist and shared functions. The Group’s businesses, which each represent a reportable operating segment for the purpose of segmental reporting, are: - Generation: power generation activities in the UK; - Customers: supply of electricity and gas to business customers in the UK; and - Pellet Production: production of sustainable compressed wood pellets at our processing facilities in the US. The B2B Energy Supply segment disclosed in 2018 has been renamed Customers, to align more closely with the Group’s strategy. Generation includes the financial results of the new generation assets acquired on 31 December 2018 from ScottishPower. Information reported to the Board for the purposes of assessing performance and making investment decisions is based on these three segments. The measure of profit or loss for each reportable segment presented to the Board on a regular basis is Adjusted EBITDA (as defined on page 131). Operating costs are allocated to segments to the extent they are directly attributable to the activities of that segment. Corporate office costs are included within central costs. Segment revenues and results The following is an analysis of the Group’s performance by reportable operating segment for the year ended 31 December 2019. The Board monitors the Adjusted Results for the Group by reportable operating segment as presented in the tables below: Year ended 31 December 2019 Exceptional items Pellet Intra-group Adjusted and certain Total Generation Customers Production eliminations Results  remeasurements Results £m £m £m £m £m £m £m Revenue External sales                        2,433.8 2,269.1          –          – 4,702.9 10.5 4,713.4 Inter-segment sales 1,512.7 –      229.4      (1,742.1)         –          – – Total revenue                        3,946.5      2,269.1      229.4      (1,742.1) 4,702.9        10.5     4,713.4 Segment gross profit 649.5 134.1 84.1        (0.6) 867.1 (132.8) 734.3 Segment Adjusted EBITDA               407.5        17.4 31.5        (0.6) 455.8 Central costs (46.0)         –       (46.0) Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA 409.8 Acquisition and restructuring costs                                                       –        (9.0) (9.0) Depreciation and amortisation                                                       (207.9)         – (207.9) Losses on disposals                                                                  (1.2)         –        (1.2) Other gains 3.1           – 3.1 Operating profit                                                       203.8 (141.8) 62.0 Net finance costs (60.0)       (5.2) (65.2) Foreign exchange (losses)/gains                                                        (1.6)        2.0 0.4 Profit/(loss) before tax                                                             142.2      (145.0) (2.8) |Col1|Year ended 31 December 2019 Exceptional items Pellet Intra-group Adjusted and certain Total| |---|---| ----- F-53 138 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2019 ----- 2.1 Segmental reporting continued The following is an analysis of the Group’s performance by reportable operating segment for the year ended 31 December 2018 Year ended 31 December 2018 |Col1|Pellet Generation Customers Production £m £m £m|Exceptional items Intra-group Adjusted and certain eliminations Results remeasurements £m £m £m|Total Results £m| |---|---|---|---| Revenue External sales 1,994.9 2,242.4 – – 4,237.3 (8.3) 4,229.0 Inter-segment sales 1,336.7 – 213.7 (1,550.4) – – – Total revenue 3,331.6 2,242.4 213.7 (1,550.4) 4,237.3 (8.3) 4,229.0 Segment gross profit 396.0 143.4 65.1 (3.5) 601.0 38.4 639.4 Segment Adjusted EBITDA 232.4 28.2 20.8 (3.5) 277.9 Central costs (28.3) Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA 249.6 Acquisition and restructuring costs – (27.7) (27.7) Depreciation and amortisation (173.8) (26.8) (200.6) Losses on disposals (3.9) – (3.9) Other gains 4.1 – 4.1 Operating profit/(loss) 76.0 (16.1) 59.9 Net finance costs (39.2) (7.2) (46.4) Foreign exchange gains 0.3 – 0.3 Profit/(loss) before tax 37.1 (23.3) 13.8 The accounting policies applied for the purpose of measuring the segments’ profits or losses, assets and liabilities are the same as those used in measuring the corresponding amounts in the Group’s financial statements. The external revenues and results of all the reporting segments are subject to seasonality, with higher dispatch and prices in the winter months compared to summer months. Capital expenditure by segment Assets and working capital are monitored on a consolidated basis; however, spend on capital projects is monitored by operating segment.

Total cash outflows in relation to capital expenditure during the year were £171.4 million (2018: £132.6 million). See the Group Financial Review on pages 14-19 for further details about the key capital investments in the year. Intra-group trading Intra-group transactions are carried out at management’s best estimate of arm’s-length, commercial terms that, where possible, equate to market prices at the time of the transaction. During 2019, the Pellet Production segment sold wood pellets with a total value of £229.4 million (2018: £213.7 million) to the Generation segment and the Generation segment sold electricity, gas and ROCs with a total value of £1,512.7 million (2018: £1,336.7 million) to the Customers segment. The impact of all intra-group transactions, including any unrealised profit arising, is eliminated on consolidation. |Additions to Additions to property, Additions to intangible plant and intangible assets equipment assets 2019 2019 2018 £m £m £m|Additions to property, plant and equipment 2018 £m| |---|---| ----- #### Section 2: Financial performance continued 2.1 Segmental reporting continued Major customers Total consolidated revenue for the year ended 31 December 2019 includes £575.7 million from one individual customer (2018: £555.8 million from one individual customer) that represented 10% or more of total revenue for the year. These revenues arose in the Generation segment. 2.2 Revenue Accounting policy Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods or services provided to customers in the normal course of business, net of trade discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes and excluding transactions between Group companies. Revenue is presented gross in the income statement as the Group controls the specified good or service prior to the transfer to the customer. Revenues from the sale of electricity by the Group’s Generation business are measured based upon metered output delivered at rates specified under contract terms or prevailing market rates as applicable. The performance obligations for these contracts are satisfied over time and control is deemed to have passed to the customer at the point that the electricity has been supplied. The output method is used to recognise revenue, this method recognises revenue based on the value transferred to the customer. This is measured based on energy supplied to the customer with the amount billed based on the units of electricity supplied. Three biomass-fuelled generating units at Drax Power Station and certain generators across the Hydro-electric plants earn Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) under the UK Government’s Renewables Obligation (RO) regime. The financial benefit of a ROC is recognised in the income statement at the point the relevant renewable biomass fuel is burnt and power dispatched as a reduction in the cost of the biomass fuel. For Hydro assets this is at the point that the renewable energy is generated. A corresponding asset is recognised on the balance sheet (see note 3.4). The performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time when the legal title to the ROC is transferred to the third party. This is when revenue from the sale is recognised. The Group recognises the income or costs arising from the Contract for Difference (CfD) (see below) in the income statement as a component of revenue at the point the Group meets its performance obligation under the CfD contract. This is considered to be the point at which the relevant generation is delivered and the payment becomes contractually due. Revenue from the sale of electricity and gas directly to business customers through the Customers business is recognised on the supply of electricity or gas when a contract exists, supply has taken place, a quantifiable price has been established or can be determined and the receivables are expected to be recovered at the point of sale. Energy supplied is measured based upon metered consumption and contractual rates; however, where a supply has taken place but is not yet measured or billed, the revenue is estimated based on consumption statistics and selling price estimates and is recognised as accrued income. Revenue for contracts satisfied over time is recognised in line with the progress of those contracts. The measurement of progress is based on cost inputs for fixed price Customers contracts, and volume supplied for other contracts. Assumptions are applied consistently but third party costs can be variable, therefore actual outcomes may vary from initial estimates. The Group is eligible for, and therefore applies, the practical expedient available in IFRS 15 and has not disclosed information related to the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations. The right to receive consideration from a customer is at an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Group’s performance completed to date. Other revenues derived from the provision of services to National Grid (for example, the supply of system support services) are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contractual performance obligations. Most such contracts are for the delivery of a service either continually or on an ad-hoc basis over a period of time and thus stage of completion is calculated by reference to the amount of the contract term that has elapsed. Depending on the contract terms this approach may require judgement in estimating probable future outcomes. Other revenues derived from the sale of goods (for example, by-products from electricity generation such as ash and gypsum) are recognised at the point the control of the goods is transferred to the customer, typically at the point of delivery to the customer’s premises. ----- 2.2 Revenue continued CfD payments The Group is party to a CfD with the Low Carbon Contracts Company (LCCC), a Government-owned entity responsible for delivering elements of the Government’s Electricity Market Reform Programme. Under the contract, the Group makes or receives payments in respect of electricity dispatched from a specific biomass-fuelled generating unit. The payment is calculated by reference to a strike price of £100 per MWh. The base year for the strike price was 2012 and it increases each year in line with the UK Consumer Price Index and changes in system balancing costs. The strike price at 31 December 2019 was £113.65 per MWh. When market prices (based on average traded prices in the preceding season) are above/below the strike price, the Group makes/ receives an additional payment to/from LCCC equivalent to the difference between that market power price and the strike price, for each MWh produced from the generating unit supported by the CfD. Such payments are in addition to amounts received from the sale of the power in the wholesale market and either increase or limit the total income from the power dispatched from the relevant generating unit to the strike price in the CfD contract. ROC sales The generation and sale of ROCs is a key driver of the Group’s financial performance. The RO scheme places an obligation on electricity suppliers to source an increasing proportion of their electricity from renewable sources. Under the RO, ROCs are certificates issued to generators of renewable electricity which are then sold to bilateral counterparties, including suppliers, to demonstrate that they have fulfilled their obligations under the RO. ROCs are managed in compliance periods (CPs), running from April to March annually, CP1 commenced in April 2002. At 31 December 2019 the Group is operating in CP18. To meet its obligations a supplier can either submit ROCs or pay the “buy-out” price at the end of the CP. The buy-out price was set at £30 per ROC in CP1 and rises with the UK Retail Price Index. The buy-out price in CP18 is £48.78. ROCs are typically procured in arm’s-length transactions with renewable generators at a market price slightly lower than the buy-out price for that CP. At the end of the CP, the amounts collected from suppliers paying the buy-out price form the “recycle fund”, which is distributed on a pro-rata basis to suppliers who presented ROCs in a compliance period. The financial benefit of a ROC recognised in the income statement at the point of generation is thus comprised of two parts: the expected value to be obtained in a sale transaction with a third party supplier relating to the buy-out price and the expected value of the recycle fund benefit to be received at the end of the CP. During the year, the Group made sales (and related purchases) of ROCs to help optimise its working capital position. External sales of ROCs in the table below includes £575.7 million of such sales (2018: £555.8 million), with a similar value reflected in cost of sales. See note 3.4 for further details of ROCs generated and sold by the Generation businesses and those utilised by the Customers business in the year.

The Group has taken the exemption available under short-term and low value leases. Leases that have a term of less than 12 months or the underlying asset is less than £3,500 are expensed to the income statement on a systematic basis over the term of the lease. The amounts expensed in relation to short-term and low value leases in 2019 was £0.7 million. ----- 142 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2019 ----- 2.3 Operating expenses continued Auditor’s remuneration Years ended 31 December 2019 2018 £000 £000 Audit fees: Fees payable for the audit of the Group’s consolidated financial statements 863.9 905.1 Fees payable for the audit of the Company’s subsidiaries 36.0 32.4 899.9 937.5 Other fees: Review of the Group’s half-year condensed consolidated financial statements 96.2 91.0 Other services 2.0 2.0 Total audit-related fees 998.1 1,030.5 Other assurance services 180.0 1,335.0 Other non-audit fees – 139.0 Total non-audit fees 180.0 1,474.0 Total auditor’s remuneration 1,178.1 2,504.5 The Group fee relates to the audit of all the subsidiaries to a statutory materiality.

Other assurance services provided by Deloitte LLP in 2019 consist of agreed upon procedures and other assurance services provided in connection with the bond issuance in May 2019 (2018: assurance and agreed-upon procedures performed in connection with the bond issuance in April 2018, and reporting accountant and related services for the Class I circular issued for the acquisition of the new generation assets from ScottishPower). Other non-audit fees in 2018 comprised a review of IT resilience and Disaster Recovery processes. Non-audit services are approved by the Audit Committee in accordance with the policy set out on the Group‘s website [(www.drax.com/policies) and discussed](http://www.drax.com/policies)) further in the Audit Committee report on page 78. 2.4 Review of fixed assets for impairment Accounting policy The Group reviews its fixed assets (or, where appropriate, groups of assets known as cash-generating units (CGUs)) whenever there is an indication that an impairment loss may have been suffered. The Group assesses the existence of indicators of impairment annually. In respect of the Customers and Pellet Production businesses, the Group considers the smallest groups of assets that generate independent cash flows to be equivalent to the operating entities within those businesses – Haven Power, Opus Energy and Drax Biomass. In respect of the Generation business, the Group considers the smallest groups of assets that generate independent cash flows to be the individual sites that share common infrastructure and control functions (eight in total). If an indication of potential impairment exists, the recoverable amount of the asset or CGU in question is assessed with reference to the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the continuing use of the asset or CGU (value in use) or the expected price that would be received to sell the asset to another market participant (fair value less costs to sell). The initial assessment of recoverable amount is normally based on value in use. Where value in use is calculated, the assessment of future cash flows is based on the most recent approved business plan and includes all of the necessary costs expected to be incurred to generate the cash inflows from the CGU’s assets in their current state and condition, including an allocation of centrally managed costs. Central costs are only allocated where they are necessary for and directly attributable to the CGU’s activities. Future cash flows include, where relevant, contracted cash flows arising from the Group’s cash flow hedging activities and as a result the carrying amount of each CGU includes the mark-to-market value of those cash flow hedges. ----- #### Section 2: Financial performance continued 2.4 Review of fixed assets for impairment continued The additional value that could be obtained from enhancing or converting the Group’s assets is not reflected, nor the potential benefit of any future restructuring or reorganisation. In determining value in use, the estimate of future cash flows is discounted to present value using a pre-tax rate reflecting the specific risks attributable to the CGU in question. If the recoverable amount is less than the current carrying amount in the financial statements, a provision is made to reduce the carrying amount of the asset or CGU to the estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised immediately in the income statement. Goodwill balances and intangible assets with an indefinite useful economic life are assessed for impairment annually (see note 5.2 and 5.3). Assessment of indicators of impairment A review of the Group’s CGUs did not give rise to any indicators of impairment. Accordingly no detailed impairment calculation has been completed for CGUs where no goodwill is allocated (Drax Power, Drax Biomass and the four CCGTs within Generation). The review considered the impact on previously calculated headroom of movements in market prices for commodities and changes in foreign exchange rates. Impairment considerations for CGUs where goodwill has previously been allocated are set out in note 5.2. Separate consideration has been given to the impact on the OCGT development assets, see note 5.3. During 2019, the Group finalised its assessment of CGUs, and the allocation of goodwill to those CGUs, in respect of the new generation assets acquired from ScottishPower on 31 December 2018. See note 5.1 for details. All impairment reviews conducted in 2019 indicated adequate headroom to conclude that no impairment charges were required. Accordingly, no amounts have been charged to the income statement in respect of asset impairment in 2019. (2018: £26.8 million asset obsolescence charge in respect of coal-specific assets no longer required following the conversion of a generating unit to run on biomass at Drax Power Station). 2.5 Net finance costs Finance costs reflect expenses incurred in managing the debt structure (such as interest payable on bonds) as well as foreign exchange gains and losses, the unwinding of discount on provisions for reinstatement of the Group’s sites at the end of their useful lives (see note 5.4) and net interest charged on the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme obligation (see note 6.3) and lease liabilities (see note 3.2). These are offset by interest income that the Group generates through efficient use of short-term cash surpluses – for example through investment in money market funds. On 2 January 2019, the Group drew down £550 million from the £725 million acquisition bridge facility to partially fund the acquisition of the new generation assets, with the remainder of the consideration funded from the Group’s cash resources. Deferred financing costs in relation to the acquisition bridge facility of £5.2 million were written off to the income statement. Financing costs of £15.5 million in relation to the new facilities have been deferred and are being amortised over the term of the facilities. (2018: incremental costs of £3.8 million in relation to new borrowings were deferred and are being amortised at the effective interest rate, and £5.2 million in relation to floating rate notes and an early repayment charge of £2.0 million were written off). As described in note 2.7, the £5.2 million of costs associated with the acquisition bridge facility have been excluded from the Adjusted Results and are presented as exceptional items in arriving at Total Results. Further information about the Group’s financing structure can be found in note 4.3. ----- 2.5 Net finance costs continued Interest payable and similar charges: Years ended 31 December Interest payable on borrowings (49.8) (36.3) Interest on lease liabilities (note 3.2) (1.2) – Unwinding of discount on provisions (note 5.4) (4.5) (0.9) Amortisation of deferred finance costs (4.2) (3.1) Net finance credit in respect of defined benefit scheme (note 6.3) 0.8 0.1 Other financing charges                                                                        (2.4) (0.2) Total interest payable and similar charges included in adjusted results                                  (61.3)      (40.4) Interest receivable: Interest income on bank deposits 1.3 1.2 Total interest receivable included in adjusted results 1.3 1.2 Foreign exchange (losses)/gains included in adjusted results (1.6) 0.3 Total recurring net interest charge included in adjusted results (61.6) (38.9) Exceptional costs of debt restructure: Fees to exit existing facilities                                                                       – (2.0) Acceleration of deferred costs in relation to previous facilities                                          (5.2) (5.2) Total exceptional costs of debt restructure                                                         (5.2)        (7.2) Certain remeasurements on financing derivatives 2.0 – Total net interest charge (64.8) (46.1) Foreign exchange gains and losses in interest arise on the retranslation of non-derivative balances denominated in foreign currencies to prevailing rates at the balance sheet date. 2.6 Current and deferred taxation The tax charge includes both current and deferred tax. Current tax is the estimated amount of tax payable on this year’s taxable profits (which are adjusted for items upon which the Group is not required to pay tax or, in some cases, for items which are not allowable for tax purposes and therefore on which additional tax is required) and adjusted for estimates for previous years. Deferred tax is an accounting adjustment which reflects where more or less tax is expected to arise in the future due to differences between the accounting and tax rules. This is reflected in differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profits. The tax credit reflects the estimated effective tax rate on the loss before tax for the Group for the year ended 31 December 2019 and the movement in the deferred tax balance in the year, so far as it relates to items recognised in the income statement. Accounting policy Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is based on the taxable profit or loss for the year in the relevant jurisdiction. Taxable profit or loss differs from profit/loss before tax as reported in the income statement, because it excludes items of income or expenditure that are either taxable or deductible in other years or never taxable/deductible. The Group’s liability (or asset) for current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other h i i di tl i it i hi h th t d d f d t i d i th h i ----- Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2019 145 ----- #### Section 2: Financial performance continued 2.6 Current and deferred taxation continued The Group has adopted the research and development expenditure credit regime (RDEC). Under this regime, research and development tax credits are accounted for as development grants, and are recorded in operating profit within the income statement, with the corresponding receivable being offset against corporation tax payable. Significant estimation uncertainty In accounting for taxation the Group makes assumptions regarding the treatment of items of income and expenditure for tax purposes. The Group believes that these assumptions are reasonable, based on prior experience and consultation with advisers. Full provision is made for deferred taxation at the rates of tax prevailing at the period end date unless future rates have been substantively enacted. Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is considered more likely than not that they will be recovered. Where such assets relate to losses incurred by a business unit, particularly one with a history of losses, the Group seeks evidence other than its own internal forecasts to support recognition of the related deferred tax asset.

Tax for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled, or the asset is realised based on jurisdictional tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. ----- F-61 146 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2019 ----- 2.6 Current and deferred taxation continued The tax charge for the year can be reconciled to the profit before tax as follows: Year ended 31 December 2019 Year ended 31 December 2018 Exceptional Exceptional items items Total Adjusted and certain Total Adjusted and certain Results Results remeasurements Results Results remeasurements (Restated) £m £m £m £m £m £m Profit/(loss) before tax 142.2 (145.0) (2.8) 37.1 (23.3) 13.8 Profit/(loss) before tax multiplied by the rate of corporation tax in the UK of 19.00% (2018: 19.00%) 27.0 (27.5) (0.5) 7.0 (4.4) 2.6 Effects of: Adjustments in respect of prior periods 2.9 – 2.9 (5.7) – (5.7) Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 0.6 0.1 0.7 1.1 3.5 4.6 Effect of changes in tax rate 1.8 – 1.8 0.2 – 0.2 Difference in overseas tax rates (0.2) – (0.2) (0.3) – (0.3) Patent box benefit (8.0) – (8.0) (8.1) – (8.1) Other – – – 1.0 (0.7) 0.3 Total tax charge/(credit) 24.1 (27.4) (3.3) (4.8) (1.6) (6.4) As a result of the reduction in the US federal tax rates to 21% from 2018, and tax relief now arising to the Group from the UK Patent Box regime (see below), in the medium term, the Group anticipates that the underlying effective tax rate will be marginally lower than the main rate of corporation tax in the UK. Drax Power was granted a patent to protect certain intellectual property it owns and which attaches to the technology developed to manage the combustion process in generating electricity from biomass. Under UK tax legislation the Company is entitled to apply a lower rate of tax to some of its profits each year which are derived from utilisation of that technology.

In order to provide a clear and consistent view of trading performance, certain remeasurements and exceptional items are presented in a separate column. The Group believes that this presentation provides useful information about the financial performance of the business and is consistent with the way executive management and the Board assess the performance of the business. The Group has a framework for the determination of transactions as exceptional. Transactions presented as exceptional are approved by the Audit Committee. In these financial statements, the following transactions have been designated as exceptional items and presented separately: - Acquisition and restructuring costs associated with the acquisition and on-boarding of Drax Generation Enterprise Limited (formerly ScottishPower Generation Limited) (2019 and 2018) into the Group, along with costs associated with the restructuring of the Pellet Production and Customers businesses (2018). - Asset obsolescence charges, which in 2018 related to coal-specific assets associated with the conversion of the fourth unit at Drax Power Station to run on biomass fuel. - Costs incurred as a result of restructuring the Group’s debt in 2019 and 2018, including facility break costs and the acceleration of the amortisation of deferred finance costs associated with the redeemed facilities. Interest costs that relate to the acquisition bridge facility have been classified as exceptional, as they relate directly to the acquisition described above. - Certain remeasurements comprise gains or losses on derivative contracts to the extent that those contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, or hedge accounting is not effective, and those gains or losses are either i) unrealised and relate to the delivery of commodity contracts in future periods, or ii) are realised in relation to the delivery of commodity contracts in the current period. The effect of excluding certain remeasurements from the Adjusted Results is to reflect commodity sales and purchases at contracted prices – i.e. at the all-in-hedged amount paid or received in respect of the delivery of the commodity in question, to better present the trading performance of the Group in Adjusted Results.

Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the Group’s earnings (profit after tax in accordance with IFRS) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares that were in issue during the year. Diluted EPS demonstrates the impact if all outstanding share options that are expected to vest on their future maturity dates (such as those to be issued under employee share schemes – see note 6.2) were exercised and treated as ordinary shares as at the balance sheet date. Years ended 31 December 2019 2018 Earnings attributable to equity holders of the Company (£m) 0.5 20.2 Number of shares: Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of basic earnings per share (millions) 395.5 402.4 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares under share plans 1.9 4.5 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of diluted earnings per share (millions) 397.4 406.9 Earnings/(loss) per share – basic (pence) 0.1 5.0 Earnings/(loss) per share – diluted (pence) 0.1 4.9 Repurchased shares (see note 4.5) are not included in the weighted average calculation of shares.

The final dividend has not been included as a liability as at 31 December 2019. This would bring total dividends payable in respect of the 2019 financial year to £63 million. The Group has a long-standing capital allocation policy. This policy is based on a commitment to robust financial metrics that underpin the Group’s strong credit rating; investment in the core business; paying a sustainable and growing dividend; and returning surplus capital to shareholders. The Board is confident that the dividend is sustainable and expects it to grow as the implementation of the Group’s strategy generates an increasing proportion of stable earnings and cash flows. In determining the rate of growth in dividends the Board will take account of future investment opportunities and the less predictable cash flows from the Group’s commodity based businesses. In future years, if there is a build-up of capital in excess of the Group’s investment needs, the Board will consider the most appropriate mechanism to return this to shareholders. ----- 2.10 Retained profits Retained profits are a component of equity reserves. The overall balance reflects the total profits the Group has generated over its lifetime, reduced by the amount of that profit distributed to shareholders. The table below sets out the movements in retained profits during the year: Years ended 31 December 2019 2018 £m £m At 1 January 442.7 457.9 Profit for the year 0.5 20.2 Actuarial (losses)/gains on defined benefit pension scheme (note 6.3) (21.5) 15.9 Deferred tax on actuarial gains on defined benefit pension scheme (note 2.6) 4.3 (3.0) Equity dividends paid (note 2.9) (58.9) (52.5) (Loss)/gain on equity investment (0.1) 0.2 Net movements in equity associated with share-based payments (note 6.2) 2.7 4.0 At 31 December 369.7 442.7 Distributable profits The capacity of the Group to make dividend payments is primarily determined by the availability of retained distributable profits and cash resources. The Parent Company financial statements set out on pages 209 to 215 of this Annual report, disclose the Parent Company’s distributable reserves of £188.2 million. Sufficient reserves are available across the Group as a whole to make future distributions in accordance with the Group’s dividend policy for the foreseeable future. The majority of the Group’s distributable reserves are held in holding and operating subsidiaries. Management actively monitors the level of distributable reserves in each company in the Group, ensuring adequate reserves are available for upcoming dividend payments and that the Parent Company has access to these reserves. The immediate cash resources of the Group of £404.1 million are set out in note 4.2 and the recent history of cash generation within note 4.4. The majority of these cash resources are held centrally within the Group by Drax Corporate Limited for treasury management purposes and are available for funding the working capital and other requirements of the Group. The Group’s financing facilities (see note 4.3) place certain conditions on the amount of dividend payments to be made in any given year. The Group expects to be able to make dividend payments, in line with its policy, within these conditions for the foreseeable future. ----- #### Section 3: Operating assets and working capital This section gives further information on the operating assets we use to generate revenue and the short-term liquid assets and liabilities, managed during day-to-day operations, that comprise our working capital balances. 3.1 Property, plant and equipment This note shows the cost, depreciation and net book value of the physical assets controlled by the Group that are used in the businesses to generate revenue. The cost of an asset is what was paid to purchase or construct the asset. Depreciation reflects the usage of the asset over time and is calculated by taking the cost of the asset, net of any residual value, to the income statement evenly over the useful economic life of the asset. An asset’s net book value is its cost less any depreciation (including impairment, if required) charged to date. Accounting policy Property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost. Cost comprises the purchase price (after deducting trade discounts and rebates), any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management and the estimate of the present value of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment in value. The Group construct many of its assets as part of long-term development projects. Assets that are in the course of construction are not depreciated until they are ready for use in the way intended. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write down assets to their residual value evenly over the estimated useful economic lives (UEL) of the assets from the date of acquisition (where relevant, limited to the expected decommissioning date of the site where the asset is located – currently expected to be between 2023–2038 for the gas-fired plants, 2039 for Drax Power Station and 2067 for the hydro-electric plants (including pumped storage). The gas-fired plants have a range of plant decommissioning dates depending on the equipment installed at each site). The table below shows the range of useful lives at the date of acquisition and the average remaining useful life at the balance sheet date of the main categories of asset we own in years: Range of UELs Freehold buildings 16 6–71 Plant and equipment Electricity generation assets: Drax Power Station common plant 12 3–33 Drax Power Station biomass-specific assets 15 2–27 Drax Power Station coal-specific assets 4 5–19 Hydro-electric plants (including pumped storage) 40 4–141 Gas-fired plants 9 2–38 Pellet production plant 12 4–25 Other plant, machinery and equipment 12 1–33 Decommissioning asset 19 35 Plant spare parts 19 Up to 35 Freehold land held at cost is considered to have an unlimited useful life and is not depreciated. Electricity generation assets are grouped according to the fuel type of the plant. Certain assets at Drax Power Station are common to the whole plant and are shown separately. Pellet production plant includes the US-based assets of the Group’s Pellet Production segment and the assets at the Daldowie Fuel Plant near Glasgow. Plant spare parts are depreciated over the remaining useful life of the relevant power station or plant. Costs relating to major inspections, overhauls and upgrades to the power station are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, if the recognition criteria are met; namely, when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually, taking into account regulatory change and commercial and technological obsolescence, as well as normal wear and tear. Residual values are based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date. Any changes are applied prospectively. ----- Significant estimation uncertainty Asset lives are reviewed annually at each balance sheet date. No changes to the useful economic lives of assets have been made as a result of the most recent review. Following previous UK Government announcements pertaining to the cessation of coal generation, the Group concluded that coal generation will cease during 2025 but that the two existing coal units will be retained for conversion to alternative fuels in the period to 2039. In February 2020, the Government announced its intention to bring forward the closure date for coal by one year to October 2024. Subsequently, on 26 February, the Board approved a proposal to accelerate the closure of the Group’s two remaining coal-fired generating units at Drax Power Station from 2025 to 2022 (see page 118). At each balance sheet date the Group reviews its property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that these assets may be impaired. The Group’s accounting policy in respect of impairment, along with details of the impairment review conducted during 2019, are set out in note 2.4. In the two tables below, amounts as at 1 January and 31 December 2018 have been restated to correct a historical currency translation error in the application of foreign exchange rates to balances held in subsidiaries with a functional currency other than sterling. Previously, these balances have been incorrectly retranslated into the presentational currency of the Group at the rate presiding at the date of the transaction. The restated amounts reflect these balances being translated at the closing rate at the relevant Balance Sheet date as required by IAS 21. At 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2018 this results in an increase of £37.8 million and £55.5 million respectively in the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment compared to the amounts previously reported, with a corresponding increase in the translation reserve (see note 8.3). The adjustment does not affect previously reported amounts for the income statement, basic or diluted earnings per share, nor cash. The comparative balances at 31 December 2018 have been restated due to the finalisation of acquisition values in relation to the new generation assets acquired from ScottishPower on 31 December 2018 (see note 5.1).

When spares are utilised in such projects, the cost of the part is transferred from the property, plant and equipment balance and recognised as an expense in the income statement within operating costs. Total depreciation of £165.9 million per the income statement includes £6.9 million of depreciation and impairment on right-of-use assets, see note 3.2 |Col1|Biomass and Hydro-electric coal plant plant £m £m|Pellet production Gas thermal plant plants Restated £m £m|Total plant and equipment Other Restated £m £m| |---|---|---|---| ----- 3.1 Property, plant and equipment continued Post balance sheet event On 26 February 2020, the Board approved a proposal to accelerate the closure of the Group’s two remaining coal fired generating units at Drax Power Station from 2025 to 2022. In assessing the financial impact of this decision, the Group will consider the useful lives, residual values and potential impairment of certain assets at Drax Power Station. The timing for completing this impairment review is uncertain as the assets remain an integral part of the site and a detailed closure plan needs to be finalised. The carrying amount of affected assets was approximately £240 million at 31 December 2019. See page 118 for further details. 3.2 Leases Accounting policy IFRS 16 determines a control model to distinguish between lease agreements and service contracts on the basis of whether the use of an identified asset is controlled by the Group. If the Group is deemed to have control of an identified asset, then a lease is recognised on the balance sheet. A right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability are recognised. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments discounted using the discount rate that is implicit in the lease. If this discount rate cannot be determined from the agreement, the liability is discounted using an incremental borrowing rate. The liability is subsequently adjusted for interest, repayments and other modifications. Lease modifications are accounted for as a separate lease where the scope of the lease increases through the right to use one or more underlying assets and where the consideration of the lease increases by an amount that is equivalent to the standalone price of the increase in scope. Where a modification decreases the scope of the lease, the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is adjusted and a gain or loss is recognised in proportion to the decrease in scope of the lease. All other modifications are accounted for as a reassessment of the lease liability with a corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use asset. Lease extension or termination options are included within the lease term when the Group as the lessee has the discretion to exercise the option and where it is probable that the option will be exercised. Leases with a term shorter than 12 months or where the identified asset has a value below £3,500 are expensed to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the adoption of the agreement. See note 8.3 for further details on the adoption of IFRS 16.

The Group is committed to payments for short-term and low value leases of £0.6 million as at 31 December 2019. The maturity of the gross undiscounted lease liability at 31 December 2019 is as follows: Total 2019 £m Within one year 7.2 Within one to five years 19.2 After five years 10.6 Total gross payments 37.0 Effect of discounting (4.5) Lease liability recognised in the Balance Sheet 32.5 Current portion 6.3 Non-current portion 26.2 3.3 Other fixed asset investments Other fixed asset investments include equity investments held by the Group. Accounting policy Other fixed asset investments are recognised at fair value, based on quoted market prices where available, at the balance sheet date. The Group designates all of its investments as fair value through other comprehensive income, as they are intended to be held and not traded, in accordance with IFRS 9. Where quoted market prices are not available fair value is estimated based on all available information. Total fixed asset investments 2019 2018 £m £m At 1 January 2.4 1.3 Additions 0.7 0.9 Fair value (losses) /gains (0.1) 0.2 At 31 December 3.0 2.4 During the year, the Group further increased its investment in C-Capture Limited. See note 7.1 for details on the fair value measurement of investments. ----- 3.4 ROC assets The Group earn Renewable Obligation Certificate (ROC) assets, which are accredited by the Office for Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem), as a result of burning sustainable compressed wood pellets to generate electricity at Drax Power Station and generating renewable energy at a certain number of the Group’s Hydro-electric plants. This note sets out the value of these assets that the Group holds at the year end. Accounting policy ROCs are recognised as current assets in the period they are generated and are initially measured at fair value based on anticipated sales prices. The value of ROCs earned is recognised in the income statement as a reduction to costs of sales in that period. Where the Customers business incurs an obligation to deliver ROCs to Ofgem, that obligation is provided for in the period incurred. At each reporting date the Group reviews the carrying value of ROC assets held against updated anticipated sales prices. Where relevant, this takes account of agreed forward sale contracts and the likely utilisation of ROCs generated to settle the Group’s own ROC obligations. Any impairment is recognised in the period incurred. The fair values and net realisable values of ROCs referred to above are calculated based on assumptions regarding future sales prices in the market, taking into account agreed forward sale contracts where appropriate. Historical experience indicates that the assumptions used in the valuation are reasonable; however, actual sales prices may differ from those assumed. ROC valuations are comprised of two parts: the expected value to be obtained in a sale transaction with a third-party supplier relating to the buy-out price and an estimate of the future benefit that may be obtained from the ROC recycle fund at the end of the compliance period. The recycle fund provides a benefit where supplier buy-out charges (incurred by suppliers who do not procure sufficient ROCs to satisfy their obligations) are paid over to suppliers who presented ROCs in a compliance period on a pro-rata basis. The estimate is based on assumptions about likely levels of renewable generation and supply over the compliance period and is thus subject to some uncertainty. The Group utilises external sources of information in addition to its own forecasts in making these estimates. Past experience indicates that the values arrived at are reasonable, but they remain subject to possible variation. Total £m Carrying amount: At 1 January 2018 145.5 Earned from generation 467.7 Purchased from third parties 582.6 Utilised by the Customers business (319.8) Sold to third parties (659.3) At 1 January 2019 216.7 Earned from generation 527.8 Purchased from third parties 513.1 Utilised by the Customers business (360.3) Sold to third parties (734.6) At 31 December 2019 162.7 Recognition of revenue from sales of ROCs is described in further detail on page 141. The Group has increased sales of ROCs in the year as a result of working capital arrangements as described in note 4.4. ----- #### Section 3: Operating assets and working capital continued 3.5 Inventories The Group hold stocks of fuels and other consumable items that are used in the process of generating electricity and raw materials used in the production of compressed wood pellets. This note shows the cost of coal, biomass, other fuels and plant consumables held at the end of the year at Drax Power Station, the Group’s facilities in the US and off-site locations. The Hydro and CCGT plants hold inventory of spare part consumables. Accounting policy The Group’s raw materials and fuel stocks are valued at the lower of the weighted average cost to purchase and net realisable value. The cost of fuel stocks includes all direct costs and overheads incurred in bringing the fuel to its present location and condition, including the purchase price, import duties and other taxes (including amounts levied on coal under the UK carbon price support mechanism) and transport/handling costs. The Group uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge the costs denominated in foreign currencies. Where these contracts are designated into hedge relationships in accordance with IFRS 9, the stock cost is recognised at the hedged value and all such gains and losses are included in cost of sales when they arise. Both coal and biomass stocks are weighed when entering, moving within or exiting the Group’s sites using technology regularly calibrated to industry standards. Fuel burn in the electricity generation process is calculated using a combination of weights and thermal efficiency calculations to provide closing stock volumes. Both calibrated weighers and efficiency calculations are subject to a range of tolerable error. All fuel inventories are subject to regular surveys to ensure these measurements are sufficiently accurate. Coal stocks are verified by an independent stock survey carried out by a suitably trained specialist and a provision is made where the survey indicates a lower level of stock than indicated by the methods described above. Despite being an independent process, the survey depends on estimates and assumptions and as a result actual values may differ. The characteristics of biomass require specialist handling and storage. Biomass at Drax Power Station is stored in sealed domes with a carefully controlled atmosphere for fire prevention purposes and thus cannot be surveyed using traditional methods. Biomass stock is surveyed using regularly calibrated RADAR scanning technology. As at 31 December 2019 2018 £m £m Coal 103.1 81.0 Biomass 164.9 114.7 Other fuels and consumables 24.0 26.8 292.0 222.5 Inventories of biomass in the year ended 31 December 2019 include £2.6 million (2018: £0.6 million) of fibre and other raw materials utilised in the production of compressed wood pellets. Inventories in the year ended 31 December 2019 include £nil (2018: £0.9 million) of work in progress in the Pellet Production business. The cost of inventories recognised as an expense in the year ended 31 December 2019 was £1,182.8 million (2018: £1,601.1 million). The value of write downs of inventory in the year was £nil (2018: £nil). Post balance sheet event On 26 February 2020, the Board approved a proposal to accelerate the closure of the Group’s two remaining coal fired generating units at Drax Power Station from 2025 to 2022. The carrying amount of coal inventory was £103.1 million at 31 December 2019, the Group expects to recover this value in full over the period to closure. See page 118 for further details. ----- 3.6 Trade and other receivables Trade receivables represent amounts owed by customers for goods or services provided but not yet been paid for. Accrued income represents income earned in the period but not yet invoiced, largely in respect of power delivered that will be invoiced the following month. Accounting policy Trade and other receivables are initially measured at transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost. The Group has access to receivables monetisation facilities under which trade receivables can be sold to a third party on a non-recourse basis. Receivables sold under such facilities are derecognised at the point of sale. Fees are recognised in the income statement as incurred. Years ended 31 December Restated |2019 £m|Restated 2018 £m| |---|---| Amounts falling due within one year: Trade receivables 134.4 168.0 Accrued income 345.9 197.0 Contract assets 6.7 4.3 Prepayments 67.3 73.2 Other receivables 54.5 31.7 608.8 474.2 Trade receivables and accrued income principally represent sales of energy to counterparties within both the Generation and Customers businesses. At 31 December 2019, the Group had amounts receivable from two significant counterparties representing 18% of total trade receivables and accrued income (2018: two significant counterparties representing 12% of total trade receivables and accrued income). The comparative balances at 31 December 2018 have been restated due to the finalisation of acquisition values in relation to the new generation assets acquired from ScottishPower on 31 December 2018 (see note 5.1). Of total trade receivables and accrued income at 31 December 2019 £275.0 million (2018: £266.6 million) relates to Customers sales. Contract assets relate to amounts for goods or services provided under customer contracts, where the entitlement to consideration is contingent on something other than the passage of time. The Group has recognised a contract asset for any work performed where payment is not yet due. Any amount previously recognised as a contract asset is reclassified to trade receivables at the point at which it is invoiced to the customer, usually in the following financial period. The reconciliation from opening to closing contract assets is as follows: Years ended 31 December 2019 2018 £m £m At 1 January 4.3 5.3 Additions as a result in changes in the measure of progress of balances brought forward at the start of the year 6.7 4.3 Additions as a result of new contracts – – Contract assets transferred to trade receivables (4.3) (5.3) At 31 December 6.7 4.3 Impairment of financial assets Accounting policy The provision for impairment of trade receivables and contract assets is measured at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit loss. The contract assets relate to amounts for goods or services provided under customer contracts and have substantially the same risk characteristics as the trade receivables for the same types of contracts. The greatest concentration of credit risk exists in the Customers business. During 2019, the Group implemented a new machine ----- F-74 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2019 159 ----- #### Section 3: Operating assets and working capital continued 3.6 Trade and other receivables continued The new method provides in full for debt where the debt is more likely than not (i.e. more than 50% probability) to become both aged over 365 days and then subsequently default. The Group considers that the overall provision applied from this method and other overlay assumptions is adequate to reflect the risk of default across the whole portfolio. The Group defines customers that have a combined probability of less than 25% as low credit risk. Other Customers balances are grouped according to the age of the debt based on a number of days past due. The provision rates remaining are based on historical collection rates and expectation of future cash collection rates. 12-month expected credit losses are calculated for other financial assets by taking the Groups’ exposure at the balance sheet date multiplied by a 12-month provision rate. The Group writes off a financial asset when there is no realistic prospect of recovery and all attempts to recover the balance have been exhausted. The net charge to the income statement in the current year for impairment losses on financial assets was £18.0 million (2018: £31.4 million), this includes a £6.1m benefit in the period in respect of resolution of legacy credit balances. The movement in the allowance for doubtful debts is laid out in the following table: Years ended 31 December 2019 2018 £m £m At 1 January 44.0 28.2 Receivables written off (27.4) (15.6) Additional amounts provided against 24.1 33.6 Amounts reversed as recovered – (0.8) Changes in models/risks parameters – (1.4) At 31 December 40.7 44.0 The expected credit loss provision above relates wholly to trade receivables and contract assets. The expected credit loss provision calculated for other financial assets of the Group was negligible. The provision above principally relates to trade receivables and contract assets in the Customers business. The risk of default within the Generation and Pellet Production businesses is considered to be extremely low and the calculated provision is negligible, this is supported by strong historic collection rates and timely receipts. Credit and counterparty risk are disclosed in further detail in note 7.2. The value of provisions calculated using the Groups’ predictive model is set out below, grouped by the combined probability assigned by the model: Estimated gross carrying Lifetime expected amount at default credit losses Probability of default range % £m £m 80–100 22.7 19.3 50–79 17.2 14.6 0–49 117.8 3.7 Total 157.7 37.6 Provision for specific debt 0.2 Closing provision 37.8 The following table shows the risk profile of amounts due from other customers based on the Group’s provision matrix at 31 December 2019 excluding the debt provided for in the table above using the combined probability model.

Balances not yet due include contract asset balances. The majority of balances not yet due are held in the Generation business where the risk of default is considered to be extremely low and immaterial to provide for, this is supported by strong historic collection rates and timely receipts. The following table shows the comparative risk profile of amounts due from other customers based on the Group’s provision matrix at 31 December 2018. Trade receivables and contract assets days past due |Balances not yet due Up to (restated) 30 days|More than More than More than 30 days 60 days 90 days|Total (restated)| |---|---|---| Group Expected credit loss rate – % <1% 7% 19% 32% 59% 26% Estimated total gross carrying amount at default – £m 22.7 75.2 11.5 6.8 58.6 174.8 Lifetime expected credit losses – £m 0.1 5.2 2.2 2.2 34.3 44.0 The above table has been restated to include contract assets of the Group and due to the finalisation of acquisition values in relation to the assets acquired from ScottishPower on 31 December 2018 (see note 5.1). 3.7 Contract costs The Group incurs costs of obtaining contracts in the Customers business. Accounting policy Management expects that incremental broker fees paid to intermediaries as a result of obtaining electricity and gas contracts are recoverable. The Group has therefore capitalised them as contract costs at the point the fee is paid. The fees are amortised on a straight line basis over the contract period in line with the recognition of revenue. The balance is included within prepayments in note 3.6. This amount includes both current and non-current balances. The reconciliation from opening to closing contract costs is as follows, there was no impairment loss recognised: Years ended 31 December 2019 2018 £m £m At 1 January 39.0 39.3 Additions 33.7 36.9 Amortisation (30.4) (37.2) At 31 December 42.3 39.0 3.8 Trade and other payables Trade and other payables represent amounts the Group owe to its suppliers (for trade purchases and ongoing costs), tax authorities and other creditors that are due to be paid in the ordinary course of business. The Group make accruals for amounts that will fall due for payment in the future as a result of the Group’s activities in the current year (e.g. fuel received but for which the Group has not yet been invoiced). Accounting policy Trade and other payables are measured at amortised cost. The Group facilitates a supply chain finance scheme, a form of reverse factoring under which certain suppliers can obtain early access to funding. There are no changes to the Group’s payment terms under this arrangement, nor would they be if the arrangement was to fall away, and the amount due is recognised in trade payables. The Group also has access to payment facilities, utilised to leverage scale and efficiencies in transaction processing. Under these facilities the Group benefits from a short extension to payment terms, within a normal working capital cycle, for a small fee. The original liability is derecognised and the amount due to the facility provider is recognised in other payables. Fees are recognised in the income statement in the period incurred ----- Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2019  161 ----- #### Section 3: Operating assets and working capital continued 3.8 Trade and other payables continued As at 31 December Restated 2019 2018 £m £m Trade payables 175.0 110.5 Fuel accruals 86.1 129.4 Energy supply accruals 364.2 309.9 Other accruals 208.8 183.4 Other payables 183.3 187.4 Contract liabilities 21.8 20.0 1,039.2 940.6 Trade payables includes £4.5m due after more than one year. Trade payables includes £33.1 million (2018: £2.2 million) related to reverse factoring. Other payables include £90.6 million (2018: £87.0 million) due under other payment facilities. Other payables include £55.0 million of ROC sales made in the period which the Group have not yet been accredited for. Once the ROCs have been accredited and transferred to the other party, this amount will be released from other payables and recognised in the income statement. Energy supply accruals include £250.0 million (2018: £235.5 million) in relation to the Group’s obligation to deliver ROCs arising from Customers activities. The remaining balance principally comprises third party grid charge accruals of £42.8 million (2018: £51.7 million) and Feed-in-Tariff accruals of £30.4 million (2018: £14.1 million). The Group recognises a liability in respect of its unsettled obligations to deliver emissions allowances under the EU Emission Trading Scheme (ETS). Accruals at 31 December 2019 include £25.5 million (2018: £nil) with respect to the Group’s estimated net liability to deliver CO2 emissions allowances. Allowances are purchased in the market and are recorded at cost. Other payables at 31 December 2018 have been restated due to the finalisation of acquisition values of the liabilities acquired in the acquisition of the new generation assets on 31 December 2018. (See note 5.1). Contract liabilities primarily relate to the advance consideration received from customers for fixed price electricity and gas contracts, for which revenue is recognised based on the stage of completion of the multi-year contract. The balance reduces as revenue is subsequently recognised in the following period, offset by further advance consideration received. The reconciliation of opening to closing contract liabilities is as follows: Years ended 31 December 2019 2018 £m £m At 1 January 20.0 27.6 Revenue recognised in the year that was included in the contract liability at the start of the period (12.5) (20.5) Additions as a result of cash received from Customers in the period not yet recognised in Revenue 14.3 12.9 At 31 December 21.8 20.0 |Col1|Restated 2019 2018 £m £m| |---|---| ----- #### Section 4: Financing and capital structure This section provides further information about the Group’s capital structure (equity and debt financing) and cash generated from operations during the year. 4.1 Reconciliation of net debt Net debt is calculated by taking the Group’s borrowings (note 4.3) and subtracting cash and cash equivalents (note 4.2). The table below reconciles net debt in terms of changes in these balances across the year. Years ended 31 December 2019 2018 £m £m Net debt at 1 January (319.1) (367.4) Increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 121.9 65.6 (Increase)/decrease in borrowings (645.3) 4.2 Effect of changes in foreign exchange rates 1.4 (21.5) Net debt at 31 December (841.1) (319.1) Borrowings include listed bonds, bank debt and revolving credit facilities, net of any deferred finance costs. Borrowings do not include other financial liabilities such as IFRS 16 lease liabilities, pension obligations and trade and other payables. Whilst the definition of net debt is unchanged from previous periods, following the adoption of IFRS 16 as of 1 January 2019, finance leases no longer form part of borrowings and have been subsumed into the larger lease liability calculated in accordance with IFRS 16. The carrying amount of finance lease liabilities at 31 December 2018 was £0.5 million. The Group does not include lease liabilities, calculated in accordance with IFRS 16, in the definition of net debt. This reflects the nature of the contracts included in this balance, which were predominantly classified as operating leases under the old lease standard (IAS 17 and IFRIC 4). These leases were therefore previously not held on the balance sheet, but were disclosed as operating commitments in the Group’s 2018 Annual Report and Accounts. At 31 December 2019, these liabilities had a carrying amount of £32.5 million (see note 3.2). A reconciliation of the increase in borrowings during the year is set out in the table on page 165. The Group has entered into cross-currency interest rate swaps, fixing the sterling value of the principal repayments in respect of the Group’s US dollar denominated debt (see note 4.3). If US dollar balances are translated at the hedged rate, rather than the rate prevailing at the balance sheet date, the carrying amount of the Group’s borrowings would be reduced by £12.2 million (2018: reduced by £22.0 million). The corresponding value of the hedging instrument is recognised at its fair value as a derivative financial instrument, (note 7.2). 4.2 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash held in current and other deposit accounts that is accessible on demand. It is the Group’s policy to invest available cash on hand in short-term, low-risk bank accounts or deposit accounts. As at 31 December 2019 2018 £m £m Cash and cash equivalents 404.1 289.0 4.3 Borrowings Accounting policy The Group measures all debt instruments (whether financial assets or financial liabilities) initially at fair value, which equates to the principal value of the consideration paid or received. Subsequent to initial measurement, debt instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Transaction costs (any such costs incremental and directly attributable to the issue of the financial instrument) are included in the calculation of the effective interest rate and are amortised over the life of the instrument. Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. Where this is the case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs. Debt instruments denominated in foreign currencies are revalued using period end exchange rates, with any exchange gains and losses arising recognised as a component of net interest charges in the period they arise. The Group hedges foreign currency risk in accordance with the policy set out in note 7 2 Where hedging instruments are used to fix cash flows associated with debt ----- Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2019 163 ----- #### Section 4: Financing and capital structure continued 4.3 Borrowings continued Reconciliation of borrowings The tables below show the movement in borrowings during the current and previous year: Year ended 31 December 2019 Borrowings before deferred Deferred Net finance costs finance costs borrowings £m £m £m Borrowings at 1 January 622.9 (14.8) 608.1 Cash movements: 2025 $200 million USD loan notes draw down 152.8 (3.4) 149.4 £550 million acquisition bridge facility draw down 550.0 (1.4) 548.6 UK infrastructure private placement draw down 375.0 (10.0) 365.0 ESG facility draw down 125.0 (2.1) 122.9 Repayment of £550 million acquisition bridge facility (550.0) – (550.0) Non-cash movements: Acceleration of deferred costs in relation to previous facilities (note 2.5) – 5.2 5.2 Indexation of linked loan 0.8 – 0.8 Amortisation of deferred finance costs (note 2.5) – 4.2 4.2 Amortisation of USD loan note premium                                                 (0.3)         –        (0.3) Effect of foreign exchange rates                                                       (8.2)         –        (8.2) Reclassification of finance leases                                                      (0.5)          –        (0.5) Borrowings at 31 December 1,267.5       (22.3)     1,245.2 On 2 January 2019, the Group drew down £550 million from the £725 million acquisition bridge facility to partially fund the acquisition of the new generation assets, with the remainder of the consideration funded from the Group’s cash resources. The acquisition bridge facility was fully refinanced in the year, ahead of its scheduled maturity in the second half of 2020, as described below. On 16 May 2019, the Group issued an additional US $200 million of the existing 2025 6.625% USD loan notes. The proceeds from the issuance were used to repay £150 million of the drawn down acquisition bridge facility. The notes were issued at 101.5% of their nominal value which, when swapped back into sterling, achieved an interest rate of 4.74%. On 24 July 2019, the Group successfully concluded the refinancing of the remaining £400 million drawn acquisition bridge facility. Two new facilities totalling £500 million were agreed with effective rates substantially inside Drax’s current cost of debt; a £375 million UK infrastructure private placement with maturities extending out to between 2024–2029 and a £125 million environment, social & governance or “ESG” facility. A proportion of the interest rate on the £125 million ESG facility is variable, based on the Group’s total carbon dioxide emissions per GWh of electricity generation. The Group’s financing structure also includes £350 million 4.25% fixed rate loan notes, US $300 million loan notes with a fixed interest rate of 6.625%, which was swapped back to sterling upon issuance at an effective interest rate of 5%, and a £350 million facility comprised of Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) with a value of £315 million and an index-linked term loan of £35 million. The RCF matures in April 2021, with an option to extend by one year. See note 7.2 for further details. Following the adoption of IFRS 16 (see note 8.3), finance leases have been reclassified to lease liabilities. Prior years have not been restated. The Group has cross-currency interest rate swaps in place (see note 7.1) to hedge the sterling cash flows associated with the USD loan notes. In addition to fixing the sterling value of interest payments over a five year period, this instrument fixes the sterling repayment of the principal at £367.5 million in 2023, the impact of which would reduce borrowings by £12.2 million. |Borrowings before deferred finance costs £m|Deferred Net finance costs borrowings £m £m| |---|---| ----- 4.3 Borrowings continued Year ended 31 December 2018 Borrowings before deferred Deferred Net finance costs finance costs borrowings £m £m £m Borrowings at 1 January                                                            605.2        (15.5) 589.7 Cash movements: 2025 US $300 million loan notes drawn down 213.3        (3.8) 209.5 Repayment of floating rate loan notes on 1 May 2018 (200.0)        – (200.0) Repayment of US $25 million revolving facility                                            (19.1)         –        (19.1) Deferred costs in relation to acquisition bridge facility                                        –        (3.8) (3.8) Non-cash movements: Indexation of linked loan 1.2           –         1.2 Amortisation of deferred finance costs (note 2.5)                                           – 3.1          3.1 Repayment of floating rate loan notes on 1 May 2018                                         –        5.2 5.2 Effect of foreign exchange rates                                                      22.6          – 22.6 Changes in finance lease liabilities                                                     (0.3)         – (0.3) Borrowings at 31 December                                                         622.9 (14.8) 608.1 Amounts drawn against each facility in the Group’s financing structure in the current and previous year is shown in the tables below: As at 31 December 2019 Borrowings before deferred Deferred Net finance costs finance costs borrowings £m £m £m 2022 fixed loan notes 350.0 (5.3) 344.7 2025 US $500 million loan notes 379.6 (5.9) 373.7 Index-linked loan 37.9 – 37.9 UK infrastructure private placement 375.0 (9.3) 365.7 ESG facility 125.0 (1.8) 123.2 Total borrowings 1,267.5 (22.3) 1,245.2 Split between: Current borrowings – – – Non-current borrowings 1,267.5 (22.3) 1,245.2 The Group has a committed £315 million revolving credit facility available but had no cash drawings at 31 December 2019.

The Group has a strong focus on cash flow discipline and uses various methods to manage liquidity. When compared to the year end position, these methods have been utilised to a broadly consistent level throughout the year unless otherwise stated. The impact of these actions on the cash flows of the Group is described below. Cash from ROCs is typically realised several months after the ROC is earned; however, through standard ROC sales and ROC purchase arrangements we are able to accelerate cash flows over a proportion of these assets. The net impact of ROC purchases and ROC sales on operating cash flows was a £131.2 million inflow (2018: £10.5 million outflow), reflected as a decrease (2018: increase) in ROC assets in the table above. The level of ROCs generated, purchased and sold during the period is set out in note 3.4. The Group also has access to facilities enabling it to sell ROC trade receivables on a non-recourse basis. These facilities were utilised during the year but no amounts remained outstanding at 31 December (2018: £nil). From time to time, where market conditions change, the Group can rebase foreign currency contracts (including cross-currency interest rate swaps). In 2019 this generated a working capital benefit, which is reflected as an adjustment to derivative remeasurements in the table above. The total cash benefit released from related trades that remained outstanding at 31 December 2019 was £106.8 million (2018: £2.9 million). This cash benefit includes £84.3 million (2018: £2.9 million) released from foreign currency contracts and £22.5 million (2018: £nil) from cross-currency interest rate swaps. ----- 4.4 Notes to the consolidated cash flow statement continued The Customers business has access to a facility which enables it to accelerate cash flows associated with trade receivables on a non-recourse basis, which generated a net cash inflow of £12.8 million in the year ended 31 December 2019, reflected as a reduction in receivables in the table above (2018: £24.4 million). The facility terms were amended in the year, increasing the facility size to £200 million from £150 million in 2018. Utilisation of the facility was £162.2 million at 31 December 2019 (2018: £149.4 million). The Group has sought to normalise payments across its supplier base resulting in certain suppliers extending payment terms and some reducing terms. Suppliers are able to access a supply chain finance facility provided by a bank, for which funds can be accelerated in advance of the normal payment terms. The facility does not affect the Group’s working capital, as payment terms remain unaltered with the Group. At 31 December 2019, the Group had trade payables of £33.1 million (2018: £2.2 million) related to reverse factoring. The Group also has access to a number of payment facilities to leverage scale and efficiencies in transaction processing, whilst providing a working capital benefit for the Group due to a short extension of payment terms within a normal working capital cycle. The amount outstanding under these facilities at 31 December 2019 was £90.6 million (2018: £87.0 million).

Shares issued under employee share schemes Throughout January to December 2019, a total of 3,282,563 shares were issued in satisfaction of options vesting in accordance with the rules of the Group’s Savings-Related Share Option Plan. Share buy-back programme In the previous financial year, the Group announced the commencement of a £50.0 million share buy-back programme. On 21 January 2019, the buy-back programme concluded. In total, the Group purchased 13.8 million shares for total consideration of £50.4 million, including transaction costs. These shares are held in a separate Treasury Share reserve awaiting reissue or cancellation and have no voting rights attached to them.

Exchange differences relating to the translation of the net assets of the Group’s US-based subsidiaries from their functional currency (US dollar) into sterling for presentation in these consolidated financial statements are recognised in the translation reserve. The share premium and the merger reserve arose on the financial restructuring of the Group which took place in 2005. Movements in the share premium reserve reflect amounts received on the issue of shares under employee share schemes. Movements in the hedge reserve and the cost of hedging reserve, which reflect the change in fair value of derivative financial instruments designated into hedge accounting relationships in accordance with IFRS 9, are set out in notes 7.4 and 7.5. |Capital Translation redemption reserve Merger reserve (restated) reserve £m £m £m|Total other reserves (restated) £m| |---|---| ----- #### Section 5: Other assets and liabilities This section provides information on the assets and liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheet that are not covered in other sections, including goodwill, other intangible assets and provisions. 5.1 Acquisitions Accounting policy Acquisitions of businesses are recognised at the point the Group obtains control of the target (the acquisition date). The consideration transferred, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are measured at their fair value on the acquisition date. The assets and liabilities are recognised in the Consolidated balance sheet and the revenues and profit or loss of the acquired business are recognised in the Consolidated income statement from the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement in the period the acquisition occurs as an exceptional item. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Acquisition of Drax Generation Enterprise Limited (formerly ScottishPower Generation Limited) There were no acquisitions during 2019; however, the Group has updated the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in respect of the acquisition of ScottishPower Generation Limited, which completed on 31 December 2018 (See pages 148-149 of the 2018 Annual Report and Accounts for further details). ScottishPower Generation Limited was renamed Drax Generation Enterprise Limited on 9 January 2019. Measurement period adjustments The fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired has been adjusted to reflect the following: - The conclusion of the completion statement process in respect of the acquisition. This process resulted in changes to the values of financial assets and liabilities as estimated amounts were confirmed subsequent to the acquisition date. As a result, the Group made a further payment in accordance with the terms of the acquisition of £4.8 million, increased the fair value of the net assets acquired by £2.5 million, and recognised a corresponding increase in goodwill of £2.3 million. - Finalisation of the terms of the defined benefit pension scheme transfer (see note 6.3). This resulted in a reduction in the net opening surplus recognised by £1.1 million, with a corresponding increase to goodwill. - The finalisation of the Group’s assessment of cash-generating units and their fair values resulted in a net £0.2 million reduction in property, plant and equipment values. As a result of these changes, total goodwill recognised in respect of the acquisition has increased by £3.5 million, to £78.3 million. The balance sheet as at 31 December 2018 has been restated. The additional consideration was paid in cash on 14 May 2019. The acquisition was subject to a risk-sharing agreement in respect of 2019 UK Capacity Market payments. Following the reinstatement of the UK Capacity Market on 25 October 2019, and the subsequent receipt of cash in January 2020 in respect of backdated Capacity Market payment owed, no further amounts are due under this arrangement. The updated fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired are set out in the table below: Original values Revised assumed at values at 31 December 31 December 2018 Remeasurements 2018 £m £m £m Property, plant and equipment 690.0 (0.2) 689.8 Financial assets 40.7 5.4 46.1 Financial liabilities (41.0) (2.9) (43.9) Pension surplus 3.8 (1.1) 2.7 Provisions (13.5) (13.5) Intangible assets 0.6 0.6 Deferred tax liability (68.5) 0.1 (68.4) Total identifiable net assets 612.1 1.3 613.4 Goodwill 74.8 3.5 78.3 Fair value of consideration payable 686.9 4.8 691.7 Goodwill of £78.3 million is largely reflective of the trading and operational opportunities that arise from acquiring a multi-site multi-fuel generation portfolio together with the assembled skilled workforce. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Intangible assets reflect software previously recognised on the balance sheet of the acquiree. ----- Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2019 169 ----- #### Section 5: Other assets and liabilities continued 5.1 Acquisitions continued Assessment of cash-generating units and allocation of goodwill The Group has determined that each generation site acquired represents a cash-generating unit for impairment testing purposes. Goodwill has been allocated to the hydro and pumped storage cash-generating units, Lanark (£11.3 million), Galloway (£40.1 million) and Cruachan (£26.9 million). The Group conducts an annual impairment test for goodwill, as required by IFRS. The acquired goodwill has been tested for the first time as at 31 December 2019. See note 5.2. 5.2 Goodwill Goodwill arises on the acquisition of a business when the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired. Accounting policy Goodwill is initially recognised and measured at the acquisition date. Goodwill is not amortised but reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the CGU to which it relates and the recoverable amount for that CGU assessed. The table below shows movements and balances: Goodwill £m Cost and carrying amount: At 1 January 2018 169.9 Acquisition of Drax Generation Enterprise Limited (note 5.1) 74.8 At 31 December 2018 (as reported) 244.7 Measurement period adjustments (note 5.1) 3.5 At 31 December 2018 (restated) and 31 December 2019 248.2 The Group recognised £74.8 million of provisional goodwill in respect of the ScottishPower transaction in 2018. In 2019 the finalisation of acquisition fair values resulted in changes in the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired of £3.5 million with a corresponding increase to goodwill (see note 5.1). Total goodwill in the Consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2019 was £248.2 million, with £10.7 million arising on the acquisition of Haven Power in 2009 attributed to the Haven Power CGU, £159.2 million arising on the acquisition of Opus Energy in 2017 attributed to the Opus Energy CGU and £78.3 million arising on the acquisition of Drax Generation Enterprise in 2019 allocated to the Lanark (£11.3 million), Galloway (£40.1 million) and Cruachan (£26.9 million) CGUs. Impairment review The recoverable amount of the Haven Power and Opus Energy CGUs is measured annually, based on a value-in-use calculation using the Group’s established planning model. This model depends on a broad range of assumptions, the most significant of which are customer margins and supply volumes. Inherent in these assumptions are expectations about future energy prices and supply costs. Cash flows beyond the business plan period are inflated into perpetuity using a growth rate of 1%. The carrying amount of the Haven Power CGU at 31 December 2019 was £49.9 million. The expected future cash flows of the CGU were discounted using a discount rate of 7.5%, calculated based on independent analysis commissioned by the Group, adjusted to the specific circumstances and risk factors affecting the Group’s Customers business. The Group believes that this rate reflects the prospects for a well-established Customers business. The value-in-use of the Haven Power CGU, including the goodwill, was significantly in excess of its carrying amount. The carrying amount of the Opus Energy CGU at 31 December 2019 was £319.5 million, including intangible assets of £140.0 million. Following further integration of Opus Energy into the Group’s existing Customers business during 2019, the discount rate was assessed as being in line with that of Haven Power at 7.5%. The value-in-use of the Opus Energy CGU, including the goodwill and intangible assets, was significantly in excess of its carrying amount. The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis of the estimates of future cash flows of the Haven Power and Opus Energy CGUs. This analysis indicates that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions, which are customer margins, supply volumes and discount rate, would not cause an impairment loss in respect of goodwill. ----- 5.2 Goodwill continued Goodwill associated with recently acquired generation assets The Group tested the goodwill associated with the Lanark, Galloway and Cruachan CGUs for the first time at 31 December 2019. The recoverable amount of each CGU was calculated based on a value-in-use calculation using the Group’s established planning model. The model depends on a broad range of assumptions, the most significant of which are power prices, operating model, sources of stability income and the discount rate applied. Cash flows beyond the business plan period are inflated into perpetuity using a growth rate of 2%. The carrying amounts and discount rates applied to each CGU are set out in the table below: CGU Carrying Amount Discount Rate Lanark 56.4 6.6% Galloway 198.1 6.6% Cruachan 319.9 6.6% The discount rates were calculated based on independent analysis commissioned by the Group, adjusted to the specific circumstances and risk factors affecting the Group’s Generation business. The value-in-use of each of the CGUs in the table above, including allocated goodwill, was significantly in excess of its carrying amount. The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis of the estimates of future cash flows of the Lanark, Galloway and Cruachan CGUs. For the Cruachan CGU, this analysis indicates that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would not cause an impairment loss in respect of goodwill. For the Lanark and Galloway CGUs, a sustained reduction in long-term power prices in excess of 5% or an increase discount rate of 1%, when compared to the assumptions applied in the value in use analysis at 31 December 2019, would result in a recoverable amount for those CGUs equivalent to their carrying amounts. These sensitivities are considered reasonably possible to arise in isolation but do not consider the impact of mitigating actions or compensating changes in other assumptions. 5.3 Intangible assets Intangible assets are not physical in nature but are identifiable and separable from other assets. Intangible assets can be acquired in business combinations (such as the acquisition of Opus Energy during 2017) or purchased separately. The Group routinely purchases computer software and carbon emissions allowances, which are considered intangible assets. Accounting policy Intangibles acquired in business combinations are measured at fair value on the acquisition date. Other intangible assets are measured at cost. Cost comprises the purchase price (net of any discount or rebate) and any directly attributable costs to bring the asset into the condition and location required for use as intended by management. Intangible assets are amortised over their anticipated useful lives. Useful lives are reviewed at each balance sheet date. No changes to useful lives were made as at 31 December 2019. Amortisation calculations are specific to each category of assets and are explained in further detail below. Carrying amounts are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. The customer-related assets and brand are attributed to the Opus Energy CGU and details of the impairment test relating to this CGU are included in note 5.2. ----- #### Section 5: Other assets and liabilities continued 5.3 Intangible assets continued Computer Customer-related software and Development assets Brand licences assets Carbon Total £m £m £m £m £m £m Cost and carrying amount: At 1 January 2018 211.0 11.3 58.0 21.0 – 301.3 Additions at cost – – 28.9 – 3.7 32.6 Transferred from Property, plant & equipment – – 7.6 – – 7.6 Acquisition – – 0.6 – 0.6 1.2 Effect of foreign exchange rates At 31 December 2018 211.0 11.3 95.1 21.0 4.3 342.7 Additions at cost – – 20.8 – – 20.8 Transferred from Property, plant & equipment – – 3.1 – – 3.1 Utilised in the period – – – – (4.3) (4.3) Disposals – – – – – – Effect of foreign exchange rates – – 0.3 – – 0.3 At 31 December 2019 211.0 11.3 119.3 21.0 – 362.6 Accumulated amortisation At 1 January 2018 35.6 1.1 32.6 – – 69.3 Charge for period 35.9 1.1 7.6 – – 44.6 Effect of foreign exchange rates – – – – – – At 1 January 2019 71.5 2.2 40.2 – – 113.9 Charge for period 30.2 1.2 10.6 – – 42.0 Effect of foreign exchange rates – – (0.2) – – (0.2) At 31 December 2019 101.7 3.4 50.6 – – 155.7 Net book value At 31 December 2018 139.5 9.1 54.9 21.0 4.3 228.8 At 31 December 2019 109.3 7.9 68.7 21.0 – 206.9 Customer-related assets Customer-related assets reflect the value of customer contracts acquired on the acquisition of Opus Energy in February 2017, which provided the Group with access to a broad customer base with contracted cash flows. The asset valuation of £211 million reflected the estimated value of the future cash flows associated with this customer base at the acquisition date and is dependent upon estimates of both current and expected future contract margins and assumed customer retention rates. The cash flows have been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 10.7%. The asset has an estimated useful life of 11 years, calculated based on customer churn-rate analysis, and is being amortised on a reducing balance basis to reflect the diminishing rate of contract renewals over time. Opus Energy brand The Opus Energy brand was acquired as part of the acquisition in February 2017 and valued at £11.3 million on a relief-from-royalty method. The brand is being amortised on a straight-line basis over its assumed 10-year useful life. |Col1|Customer-related assets Brand £m £m|Computer software and Development licences assets £m £m|Carbon Total £m £m| |---|---|---|---| ----- 5.3 Intangible assets continued Computer software Additions in the period include those in the ordinary course of business, which principally reflect ongoing investment in business systems to support the Customers segment. Software assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from three to five years. As at 31 December 2019, computer software assets in the course of construction amounted to £21.1 million (2018: £24.5 million). This includes £19.2 million for a billing system where the Group has stopped development and is in ongoing discussions with the supplier. No amounts have been provided in respect of these assets as the Group believes that the carrying amount will be recovered in full. Development assets The development assets arose on the acquisition of four OCGT projects in December 2016 and reflect the value of planning and consents. Until operations commence, the assets are considered to have an indefinite life and thus are not amortised and are subject to impairment testing at each balance sheet date. At 31 December 2019, the recoverable amount of the development assets was established using a value-in-use calculation derived from the Group’s established planning model. The assessment reflected the Government’s announcement that the Capacity Market will be reinstated and incorporated key assumptions related to likely Capacity Market clearing prices, construction costs, and the ongoing revenues to be derived from the projects once constructed. The analysis assumes a Capacity Market clearing price that is higher than recently observed clearing prices, but is supported by independent forecasts of future prices. The expected future cash flows were discounted using a rate of 7%, which includes an assessment of the level of construction and execution risk inherent in the existing assets and quality of revenue if constructed. The analysis indicated a recoverable amount in excess of the current carrying amount of the development assets. The analysis is sensitive to the key assumptions described above and the discount rate applied. Set out below are the changes in these assumptions that would result in a recoverable amount that is less than the carrying amount: - Increasing the discount rate by approximately 1.2% - A reduction in the Capacity Market clearing price achieved of 17% - An increase in the total construction cost of 12% - A reduction in system stability revenue streams of 21% If any of these circumstances were to materialise, individually or in aggregate and without mitigation, the Group may not proceed with the projects and the assets currently recognised on the balance sheet may be impaired. In particular, the analysis depends upon achieving an acceptable clearing price in future Capacity Market auctions. Carbon assets Carbon assets arise on the purchase of CO2 emissions allowances in excess of the amount allocated under the Emissions Trading Scheme and required for the current financial year, and are measured at cost, net of any impairment. Given their short tenor, carbon assets are not amortised. The charge to the income statement, within fuel costs, reflects the cost of emissions allowances required to satisfy the obligation for the current year and takes into account generation and market purchases allocated to the current financial year, and to the extent further purchases are required, is based on the market price at the balance sheet date. ----- #### Section 5: Other assets and liabilities continued 5.4 Provisions The Group makes provision for reinstatement to cover the estimated costs of decommissioning and demolishing its generation assets and remediating the sites at the end of the useful economic lives of the assets. Accounting policy Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Specifically, provision is made for the estimated decommissioning costs at the end of the useful economic life of the Group’s generating assets, when a legal or constructive obligation arises, on a discounted basis. The amount provided is calculated on a site-by-site basis and represents the present value of the expected costs. In view of the uncertainty of assessing the amount of any proceeds from the disposal of the assets at the decommissioning date, no reduction in the provision is made for any such proceeds. The discount rate used is a risk-free pre-tax rate that reflects the duration of the liability. The average discount rate used across the Group’s decommissioning provisions is 1.2% (2018: 1.8%). The use of a risk-free rate reflects the fact that the estimated future cash flows have built-in risks specific to the liability. An amount equivalent to the discounted provision is capitalised within property, plant and equipment and is depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets. The unwinding of the discount is included in interest payable and similar charges. Other provisions include a small provision in respect of dilapidation provisions for leased offices.

The decommissioning provision is based on the assumption that the decommissioning and reinstatement will take place at the end of the expected useful life of each site (which varies between 2026 and 2039) and has been estimated using existing technology at current prices based on independent third-party advice, updated on a triennial basis. The most recent updates took place in December 2017 for Drax Power Station, and 2018 for CCGT sites. |Decommissioning provision £m|Other provisions Total £m £m| |---|---| ----- #### Section 6: Our people The notes in this section relate to the remuneration of the directors and employees of the Group, including the Group’s obligations under retirement benefit schemes. 6.1 Colleagues including directors and employees This note provides a more detailed breakdown of the cost of employees, including executive directors of the Group. The average number of employees in Operations (staff based at production sites), Customers services (employees in our Customers segment) and Central and administrative functions are also provided. Further information in relation to pay and remuneration of the executive directors can be found in the Remuneration Committee report, starting on page 86. The Group acquired ScottishPower Generation Limited (subsequently renamed to Drax Generation Enterprise Limited) on the last day of the previous reporting period and as such no ScottishPower Generation Limited employee data has been included in the comparative.

The Group incurs a non-cash charge in respect of these schemes in the income statement, which is set out below along with a detailed description of each scheme and the number of options outstanding. In the year the Group has granted share appreciation rights to employees in the form of “One Drax Awards”. These are cash awards that are tracked on the Group share price over the retention period. At the date of the award the employee is granted a number of ghost shares which is based on the value of the cash award divided by the Group share price at the date of the grant. At the end of the retention period, the employee receives the cash award based on the share price at the date of redemption. Accounting policy The PSP, BMP, DSP and SAYE share-based payments are equity settled. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at the fair value of the equity instrument at the date of grant and are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the relevant vesting period, based on an estimate of the shares that will ultimately vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions, which is revised at each balance sheet date. ----- F-90 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2019 175 ----- #### Section 6: Our people continued 6.2 Share-based payments continued Costs recognised in the income statement in relation to share-based payments during the year were as follows: Years ended 31 December Equity settled PSP (granted from 2017) 0.8 1.3 DSP (granted from 2017) 0.6 0.2 BMP (granted in periods prior to 2017) (0.5) 0.7 SAYE 1.8 1.8 Cash settled One Drax awards 0.8 – Total share-based payment expense (note 6.1) 3.5 4.0 Share Incentive Plan (SIP) Between 2008 and 2010, qualifying employees could buy up to £1,500 worth of Partnership Shares in any one tax year. Matching shares were awarded to employees to match any shares they bought, in a ratio of one-to-one, with the cost of matching shares borne by the Group. There have been no awards under the SIP Partnership and Matching Share plan since 2010.

Under the PSP, annual awards of performance and service-related shares are made for no consideration to executive directors and other senior executives up to a maximum of 175% of their annual bonus. Vesting of a proportion of shares is conditional upon whether the Group’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) matches or outperforms an index (determined in accordance with the scheme rules) over three years and vesting of a proportion of shares is conditional upon performance against the internal balanced corporate scorecard. Of the PSP options granted in 2019, 50% will vest conditional on Group TSR relative to the TSR of a comparator group of companies, with the remaining 50% vesting conditional upon the internal balanced corporate scorecard. The fair value of the 2019 PSP awards of £2.7 million (2018: £2.5 million) is being charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the three-year vesting period. The fair value of PSP awards is calculated using a Monte-Carlo valuation model, which takes into account the estimated probability of different levels of vesting. The key inputs to the valuation model for the 2019 awards are the share price at the grant date of 378 pence (2018: 272 pence), expected volatility of 35% (2018: 41%), and risk-free interest rate of 0.98% (2018: 0.83%).

DSP awards are granted at nil cost and vest after three years subject to continued employment or “good leaver” termination provisions. The share price on the grant date of DSP awards made in 2019 was 378 pence (2018: 272 pence) and the fair value of these awards of £1.9 million (2018: £0.4 million) is being charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the three-year vesting period. The fair value of DSP awards is calculated using a Monte-Carlo valuation model, which takes into account the estimated probability of different levels of vesting. The key inputs to the valuation model for the 2019 awards are the share price at date of grant, expected volatility of 35% (2018: 41%), and risk-free interest rate of 0.98% (2018: 0.83%).

Bonus Matching Plan (BMP) Under the BMP, annual awards of performance and service-related shares were made for no consideration to executive directors and other senior executives up to a maximum of 150% of their annual bonus up until 2016. The BMP was replaced in 2017 by the PSP. For awards prior to 2017, a proportion of the shares vesting under the BMP are conditional upon whether the Group’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) matches or outperforms an index (determined in accordance with the scheme rules) over three years and a proportion of the shares vesting is conditional upon performance against the internal balanced corporate scorecard. The fair value of the 2017 BMP awards, £0.6 million, are being charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the corresponding three-year vesting period. The 2016 BMP awards have been fully expensed at the year end. The fair value of BMP awards is calculated using a Monte-Carlo valuation model, which takes into account the estimated probability of different levels of vesting. No BMP awards were made in 2019.

Options were granted for employees to acquire shares at a price of 298 pence (2018: 211 pence), representing a discount of 20% to the prevailing market price determined in accordance with the scheme rules. The options are exercisable at the end of three or five-year savings contracts. The fair value of the options granted in connection with the SAYE plan of £2.8 million (2018: £1.2 million) is being charged to the income statement over the term of the relevant contracts.

The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. For the SAYE options exercised during the period, the weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 325 pence (2018: 365 pence). The weighted average exercise price of SAYE options outstanding at the end of the period was 262 pence (2018: 212 pence). The weighted average remaining contractual life was 26 months (2018: 16 months). The number of options exercisable at the year-end was nil (2018: 2,252). Additional information in relation to the Group’s share-based incentive plans is included in the Remuneration Committee report on page 86. ----- 6.3 Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates two defined benefit and four defined contribution pension schemes.

The income statement charge for the defined contribution scheme represents the contributions due to be paid by the Group in respect of the current period. For the defined benefit pension schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each reporting period. Remeasurement of the obligation, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on scheme assets (excluding interest), is recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit to the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which it occurs. Defined benefit costs, including current service costs, past service costs and gains and losses on curtailments and settlements are recognised in the income statement as part of operating and administrative expenses in the period in which they occur. The net interest expense is recognised in finance costs. Significant estimation uncertainty Measurement of the defined benefit obligation using the projected unit credit method involves the use of key assumptions, including discount rates, inflation rates, salary and pension increases and mortality rates. These actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually and modified as appropriate. The Group believes that the assumptions utilised in measuring obligations under the scheme are reasonable based on prior experience, market conditions and the advice of pension scheme actuaries. However, actual results may differ from such assumptions. The assumptions applied in 2019 have been prepared on a consistent basis with those in the previous period and in accordance with independent actuarial advice received. Defined contribution schemes The Group operates four defined contribution schemes for all qualifying employees. Pension costs for the defined contribution schemes are as follows: Years ended 31 December 2019 2018 £m £m Total included in staff costs 12.5 8.1 As at 31 December 2019, contributions of £0.6 million (2018: £1.1 million) due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes. The Group has no further outstanding payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. ----- F-94 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2019 179 ----- #### Section 6: Our people continued 6.3 Retirement benefit obligations continued Defined benefit schemes The pension surplus for the two defined benefit pension schemes is as follows: As at 31 December |Col1|2018 2019 £m| |---|---| £m restated Drax Power Group section of ESPS 3.1 18.9 Drax 2019 Scheme 3.9 2.7 Total net surplus recognised in the balance sheet 7.0 21.6 -  The surplus for the Drax 2019 Scheme as reported at 31 December 2018 was provisional and has been restated as part of the finalisation of acquisition values (see note 5.1) to reflect the actual terms of the transfer agreed during the year, as described below. The DPG section of the ESPS and the Drax 2019 scheme are collectively referred to as the Defined Benefit Schemes or the Schemes below. At 31 December 2019, application of the accounting assumptions used in relation to the Defined Benefit Schemes, which are described in further detail below, continued to result in a position of surplus assets over liabilities. The scheme rules allow the Group to benefit from any residual surplus upon winding up of the Schemes. As a result, the surplus has been recognised in the balance sheet in full. The DPG section of the ESPS was closed to new members as of 1 January 2002 unless they had qualified through being existing members of another part of the ESPS. Members who joined before this date continue to build up pension benefits as part of the scheme. Members are typically entitled to an annual pension on retirement of 1/80th of final pensionable salary for each year of service plus a tax-free lump sum of three-times pension. On 31 December 2018, Drax completed a transaction to acquire assets from ScottishPower. Under the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement, employees with defined benefit pension rights were also transferred to Drax. The employees have continued to participate in the ScottishPower Pension Scheme whilst the Group has been in the process of setting up a new scheme for the members to transfer to. Over the summer of 2019 each transferring member was given the option to either transfer their past service benefits into the Drax 2019 Scheme or keep their past service in the ScottishPower Pension Scheme. As part of this, 81 members have agreed to transfer their past service into the Drax 2019 Defined Benefit Scheme. From 1 January 2020, it is expected that a further 17 members will build up future service within the Drax 2019 Scheme. Under the Drax 2019 Scheme, employees are entitled to retirement benefits based on final salary on attainment of retirement age (or earlier withdrawal or death). No other post-retirement benefits are provided. The Scheme is open to future accrual of benefits. The Schemes expose the Group to actuarial and other risks, the most significant of which are considered to be: Investment risk The scheme liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. The scheme holds a significant proportion of growth assets (diversified growth funds, direct lending and absolute return bonds) which, though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, create volatility and risk in the short term. The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the scheme’s long-term objectives. Discount rate risk A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed upon the scheme’s liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the scheme’s bond holdings. Longevity risk The majority of the scheme’s obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities of the scheme. Inflation risk The majority of the scheme’s obligations to pay benefits are linked to inflation and, as such, higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities. The majority of the assets held by the scheme are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, such that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit. In most cases, caps on inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation. The scheme has a significant holding in liability-driven investments and a substantial proportion of this risk is hedged. ----- 6.3 Retirement benefit obligations continued Other risks include operational risks (such as paying out the wrong benefits), legislative risks (such as the Government increasing the burden on pension schemes through new legislation) and other demographic risks (such as making a higher proportion of members with dependants eligible to receive pensions from the Group). The Trustees ensure certain benefits are payable on death before retirement. The most recent funding valuation of the DPG ESPS was carried out by Aon Hewitt, a qualified independent actuary, as at 31 March 2016. The actuarial review at 31 December 2019 is based on the same membership and other data as this funding valuation. The scheme board accepted the advice of the actuary and approved the use of these assumptions for the purpose of assessing the scheme cost. Future valuations are required by law at intervals of no more than three years. The results of the latest funding valuation at 31 March 2016 have been adjusted to the balance sheet date, taking into account experience over the period since that date, changes in market conditions and differences in financial and demographic assumptions. The present value of the defined benefit obligation and the related current service costs were measured using the projected unit credit method. Work commenced on a new funding valuation at 31 March 2019, this work is expected to conclude in 2020. The 2019 Scheme is yet to have its first triennial valuation. We understand that the Trustees are planning to prepare the first valuation as at 31 March 2020. The principal assumptions for the Schemes are set out below. Where absolute assumptions differ between the two schemes, reflecting differences in the expected duration of the scheme liabilities, a weighted average is shown. As at 31 December 2019 2018 % p.a. % p.a. Discount rate 2.1 3.0 Inflation (RPI) 2.9 3.2 Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.9 3.1 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.5 3.8 Mortality assumptions are based on recent actual mortality experience of scheme members and allow for expected future improvements in mortality rates. The assumptions are that a member aged 60 in 2019 will live, on average, for a further 26 years if they are male (2018: 26 years) and for a further 28 years if they are female (2018: 29 years). Life expectancy at age 60 for male and female non-pensioners currently aged 45 is assumed to be 27 and 29 years respectively (2018: 27 and 30 years respectively). The net surplus recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the Schemes is the excess of the fair value of the plan assets over the present value of the defined benefit obligation, determined as follows: As at 31 December |2019|2018 £m| |---|---| £m restated Defined benefit obligation (345.4) (312.2) Fair value of plan assets 352.4 333.8 Net surplus recognised in the balance sheet 7.0 21.6 The net surplus for 2018 has been restated to reflect net measurement period adjustments relating to the valuation of the Drax 2019 scheme acquired in 2018 (see note 5.1). The amounts disclosed in 2018 were provisional and pending confirmation of the approach for transferring assets and liabilities to the new scheme, which was finalised during 2019. ----- Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2019 181 ----- #### Section 6: Our people continued 6.3 Retirement benefit obligations continued The total charge/(credit) recognised in the income statement, within other operating and administrative expenses and finance costs, are as follows: Years ended 31 December Included in staff costs (note 6.1): Current service cost 7.1 6.8 Past service cost – 0.6 Included in finance costs (note 2.5): Interest on net defined benefit (surplus)/liability (0.8) (0.1) Total amounts recognised in the income statement 6.3 7.3 Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in full, as follows: Years ended 31 December 2019 2018 £m £m Cumulative actuarial losses on defined benefit pension schemes at 1 January (41.9) (57.8) Actuarial (losses)/gains on defined benefit pension schemes recognised in the year (21.5) 15.9 Cumulative actuarial losses recognised in the statement of comprehensive income at 31 December (63.4) (41.9) Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation of the Schemes are as follows: Years ended 31 December Restated 2019 2018 £m £m Defined benefit obligation at 1 January 312.2 306.5 Current service cost 7.1 6.8 Past service cost – 0.6 Employee contributions 0.2 0.1 Interest cost 9.0 7.8 Actuarial losses/(gains)                                                                         49.8 (23.0) Benefits paid                                                                                (32.9)       (23.2) Effect of acquisitions (restated)                                                                    –       36.6 Defined benefit obligation at 31 December 345.4 312.2 - The effect of acquisitions has been restated to reflect measurement period adjustments as a result of confirming the method of transfer during the year. The defined benefit obligation in respect of the Drax 2019 Scheme was provisionally reported as £50.7 million at 31 December 2018. The actuarial losses of £49.8 million (2018: gains of £23.0 million) reflect losses of £50.3 million arising from changes in financial assumptions (2018: gains of £21.8 million) and losses arising from scheme experience of £3.4 million (2018: losses of £0.6 million) offset by £3.9 million gains arising from changes in demographic assumptions (2018: gains of £1.8 million). The losses due to changes in financial assumptions principally reflect the decrease in the present value of the scheme liabilities arising as a result of the change in discount rate assumption to 2.1% (2018: 3.0%) following decreases in corporate bond yields. |Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in full, as follows:|Col2| |---|---| ||Years ended 31 December| ||2019 2018 £m £m| |Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation of the Schemes are as follows:|Col2| |---|---| ||Years ended 31 December| ||Restated* 2019 2018 £m £m| ----- F-97 182 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2019 ----- 6.3 Retirement benefit obligations continued Changes in the fair value of plan assets are as follows: Years ended 31 December 2018 2019 £m £m restated Fair value of plan assets at 1 January 333.8 305.3 Interest on plan assets 9.9 8.0 Remeasurement gains/(losses) 28.3 (7.2) Employer contributions 13.1 11.5 Employee contributions 0.2 0.1 Benefits paid (32.9) (23.2) Effect of acquisitions (restated) – 39.3 Fair value of plan assets at 31 December 352.4 333.8 The effect of acquisitions has been restated to reflect measurement period adjustments as a result of confirming the method of transfer during the year. The fair value of plan assets in respect of the Drax 2019 Scheme was provisionally reported as £54.5 million at 31 December 2018. Employer contributions included payments totalling £5.2 million (2018: £5.0 million) to reduce the actuarial deficit. There were contributions of £0.9 million outstanding at the end of the year (2018: £nil). The actual return on plan assets in the period was £38.2 million (2018: £0.8 million).

(2) Fixed interest bonds include a mixture of corporate, Government and absolute return bonds. (3) Other assets include £19.4 million of investments in direct lending, a type of private equity vehicle, which is not quoted in an active market (2018: £15.5 million) Cash and other assets include £49.5 million (2018: 39.3 million) in relation to the expected transfer of cash from the ScottishPower Pension Scheme, which is classed as a receivable at the balance sheet date. Following receipt of the transfer, the Drax 2019 Scheme intends to adopt an investment strategy of 70% return seeking and 30% liability matching. The pension plan assets do not include any ordinary shares issued by Drax Group plc or any property occupied by the Group. |2019 £m|2018 £m restated| |---|---| ----- #### Section 6: Our people continued 6.3 Retirement benefit obligations continued The assumptions for discount rate, inflation rate, rate of increase in pensions paid and expected return on plan assets all have a potentially significant effect on the measurement of the scheme surplus. The following table provides an indication of the sensitivity of the pension surplus at 31 December 2019 to changes in these assumptions: Increase/ (decrease) in net surplus £m Discount rate – Increase 0.25% 17.2 – Decrease 0.25% (18.2) Inflation rate[(1][)] – Increase 0.25% (14.9) – Decrease 0.25% 13.9 Life expectancy – Increase 1 year (13.3) – Decrease 1 year 13.3 Note: (1)  The sensitivity of the scheme liabilities to salary and pension increases is closely correlated with inflation The Group is exposed to investment and other experience risks, as described above, and may need to make additional contributions where it is estimated that the benefits will not be met from regular contributions and expected investment income. The DPG ESPS defined benefit obligation includes benefits for current employees of the Group (60%), former employees of the Group who are yet to retire (5%) and retired pensioners (35%). The weighted average period over which defined benefit payments are expected to be made, or the duration of the scheme liabilities, was assessed at the 31 March 2016 funding valuation to be 20 years. The Drax 2019 defined benefit obligation includes benefits for current employees of the Group and the duration of the scheme liabilities is estimated to be 25 years. Future contributions The Group expects to make regular contributions in respect of service costs of £8.1 million to the Schemes during the 12 months ended 31 December 2020. In addition to regular contributions, deficit contributions have been agreed with the Trustees based upon the Technical Provisions as at the 31 March 2016 valuation for the DGP section of the ESPS. The Technical Provisions indicate a deficit of £36 million including an estimate of the impact of future service costs, which do not meet the definition of a liability at 31 December 2019 for inclusion in the financial statements. This valuation has improved since 31 March 2016, in line with the accounting surplus, although this remains subject to a recovery plan. A new recovery plan is expected to be agreed in 2020 in relation to the 31 March 2019 valuation, which has not yet been finalised. The Group has agreed to make additional contributions over the period to 31 December 2025 to eliminate the deficit. At this point the scheme is expected to be self-sufficient and fully funded, unless material adverse changes in economic conditions arise compared to those assumed in the valuation. The Group is confident that the additional contributions are manageable within the Group’s business plan. The terms of the Trust Deed allow the Group to recover any surplus once the liabilities of the scheme have been settled. Accordingly, the deficit contributions will not give rise to an unrecognised surplus. ----- #### Section 7: Risk management This section provides disclosures around financial risk management, including the financial instruments the Group uses to mitigate such risks. 7.1 Financial instruments and their fair values The Group hold a variety of derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, payables and receivables arising from operations. Accounting classifications and fair values The tables below show the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and liabilities, including their levels in the fair value hierarchy. It does not include fair value information for financial assets and financial liabilities not measured at fair value if the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value. Cash and cash equivalents (note 4.2), trade and other receivables (note 3.6) and trade and other payables (note 3.8) generally have a short time to maturity. For this reason, their carrying values, on the historical cost basis, approximate to their fair value. The Group’s borrowings relate principally to the publicly traded high-yield loan notes and amounts drawn against term loans (note 4.3). These financial liabilities have been measured at amortised cost.

Fair value measurement - Commodity contracts fair value – The fair value of open commodity contracts that do not qualify for the own-use exemption is calculated by reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date. Given the maturity profile of these contracts, forward market price curves are available for the duration of the contracts. - Forward foreign currency exchange contracts fair value – The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts is determined using forward currency exchange market rates at the balance sheet date. - Other financial contracts fair value – The fair value of other financial contracts that do not qualify for the own-use exemption, is calculated by reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date. Given the maturity profile of these contracts, liquid forward market price curves are available for the duration of the contracts. The fair values of all derivative financial instruments are discounted to reflect the credit risk inherent within the instrument. The Group has reviewed all significant contracts for the presence of embedded derivatives. The 2022 fixed rate loan notes and the 2025 USD loan notes both contain an early repayment option that meets the definition of an embedded derivative. However, in both cases, these do not require separate valuation as they are deemed to be closely related to the host contract. IFRS 13 requires categorisation of the Group’s financial instruments in accordance with the following hierarchy in order to explain the basis on which their fair values have been determined: - Level 1 – Fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; - Level 2 – Fair value measurements are those derived from inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and - Level 3 – Fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Categorisation within this fair value measurement hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset or liability. The fair value of commodity contracts, financial contracts, interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency exchange contracts are largely determined by comparison between forward market prices and the contract price; therefore, these contracts are categorised as Level 2. The fair value of the inflation swaps comprises an RPI and CPI component. Whilst the RPI component is based on observable market rates, CPI is based on unobservable rates and therefore deemed to be Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. However, this component is not material to the overall valuation and therefore the instruments as a whole are determined to be Level 2 in line with IFRS 13. Listed equity investment valuations are derived from quoted prices in active markets and are therefore categorised as Level 1. The valuation technique used for non-listed equity investments comprises of unobservable inputs and are therefore are classified as Level 3. However, given the valuations as a whole for Level 3 equity investments are immaterial, it is not deemed necessary to include all Level 3 disclosure requirements. There have been no transfers during the year between Level 1, 2 or 3 category inputs. ----- #### Section 7: Risk management continued 7.1 Financial instruments and their fair values continued Accounting for derivatives Derivatives (subject to certain exemptions described below) must be measured at fair value, which is in essence the difference between the price the Group has secured in the contract, and the price the Group could achieve in the market at that point in time. Changes in fair value are recognised either within the income statement or the hedge reserve, dependent upon whether the contract in question qualifies as an effective hedge under IFRS 9 (see note 7.2). Where possible, the Group has taken advantage of the own-use exemption which allows qualifying contracts to be excluded from fair value mark-to-market accounting. This applies to certain contracts for physical commodities entered into and held for the Group’s own purchase, sale or usage requirements, including forward contracts for the purchase of biomass, and coal from domestic sources. Contracts for non-financial assets which do not qualify for the own-use exemption – principally power, gas, financial oil, financial coal and CO2 emissions allowances – are accounted for as derivatives in accordance with IFRS 9 and are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in fair value are reflected through the hedge reserve (note 7.3) to the extent that the contracts are designated as effective hedges in accordance with IFRS 9, or the income statement where the hedge accounting requirements are not met. To ensure these derivatives are not reflected in the underlying performance of the Group, they are excluded from the Adjusted Results in the income statement. Derivative financial instruments with a maturity date within 12 months from the balance sheet date are classified as current assets or liabilities.

The total unrealised gains/(losses) recognised on derivative financial instruments differs from the total movement on derivative financial instruments by £106.8 million due to rebasing. The fair value of the rebased trades is recognised on the lower rebased rates, resulting in a reduction in the value of derivative financial instruments recognised. However, the gains relating to the cash received from rebasing are deferred from Adjusted Results until the contracts mature. ----- 188 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2019 ----- 7.2 Financial risk management The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, liquidity risk, inflation risk, counterparty risk and credit risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of commodity and financial markets and seeks to manage potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. Risk management is overseen by the risk management committees as explained in the principal risks and uncertainties (page 54 to 61) which identify, evaluate and hedge financial risks in close co-ordination with the Group’s trading and treasury functions under policies approved by the Board of directors. 7.2.1 Commodity price risk The Group is exposed to the effect of fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly the price of electricity, gas, the price of coal, sustainable wood fibre and pellets, other fuels and the price of CO2 emissions allowances. Price variations and market cycles have historically influenced the financial results of the Group and are expected to continue to do so.

The Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments under cash flow hedge accounting. As such other components of equity are sensitive to increases/decreases in commodity price risk in relation to the impact on the hedge reserve of these movements. Commodity risk management The Group has a policy of securing forward power sales, purchases of fuel and CO2 emissions allowances when profitable to do so and in line with specified limits under approved policies. Forward power sales can be secured up to 100% of forecast availability two years out. All commitments to sell power under fixed price contracts are designated as cash flow hedges as they reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of power. The Group purchases sustainable biomass, coal and other fuels under either fixed or variable priced contracts with different maturities principally from a number of international sources. The Group considers all such contracts to be economic hedges. The Group applies the own-use exemption or hedge accounting in accordance with IFRS 9. Where forward power curves are less liquid, the Group uses financially settled gas sales as a proxy for power to mitigate the risk of power price fluctuations. The Group also purchases gas under fixed-price contracts to meet the demand of Customers’ customers and the CCGT assets as a fuel for its gas-fired generation portfolio. ----- F-104 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2019 189 ----- #### Section 7: Risk management continued 7.2 Financial risk management continued Hedge accounting The Group’s cash flow hedges relate to commodity contracts (principally commitments to sell power and purchase CO2). Amounts are recognised in the hedge reserve as the designated contracts are marked-to-market at each period end for the effective portion of the hedge, which is generally 100% of the relevant contract. Amounts held within the hedge reserve are then released as the related contract matures and the hedged transaction impacts profit or loss. For power sales contracts, this is at the point when the underlying power is delivered. Included in amounts released from equity are gains and losses on financial instruments that matured in a previous period, released to the income statement in the period the hedged transaction occurs. No ineffectiveness was recognised in the income statement in the year (2018: £nil). Due to the use of ‘all-in-one’ hedges, this results in the movement in value for the hedged items and hedging instruments being identical. The only source of ineffectiveness regarding the “all-in-one” hedges would be if delivery of the commodities be no longer expected to occur. The main sources of ineffectiveness regarding financial contracts could be as a result of timing differences and credit risk. Commodity contracts are released from equity to revenue (power contracts) or cost of sales (CO2 contracts) in the income statement. The reconciliation of the reserves and time period when the hedge will affect the profit or loss are disclosed in note 7.3. The summary of the amounts relating to the hedging instruments and any related ineffectiveness in the period is presented in the table below. Ineffectiveness on sale of power hedging instruments is recognised in revenue. Ineffectiveness on designated hedging instruments for purchases of CO2 emissions allowances and for financial coal are recognised in cost of sales. The average forward rates quoted below only reflect the rates applicable to the portion of the Group’s commodity and financial contracts that qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with IFRS 9. The rates do not reflect the overall average rate of the Group’s total portfolio of commodity and financial contracts that are used to protect the value of future cash flows. 31 December 2019 £m |Notional value of contracts Exposure (Mwh, tonnes)|Change in fair Change in fai value of hedging value o hedged instrument during Fair value item during the reporting Fair value recognised the reporting period used recognised in in balance period used for measuring balance sheet sheet for measuring Average ineffectiveness (Assets) (Liabilities) ineffectiveness|r f Ineffectiveness recognised in the period £m| |---|---|---| Commodity contracts Sale of power 4,596,250 £61.23 68.6 151.2 (79.0) (68.6) – Purchase of CO2 emissions allowances 4,341,000 €25.46 (3.3) 0.9 (4.1) 3.3 – Financial contracts Financial coal 396,000 £73.59 (4.0) – (4.0) 4.0 – 31 December 2018 Change in fair value of hedging instrument during the reporting Fair value recognised in Change in fair value of hedged item during the reporting Fair value recognised |Exposure Commodity|the repor ng Fair value recognised the repor n Notional period used recognised in in balance period used value of for measuring balance sheet sheet for measuring contracts Average ineffectiveness (Assets) (Liabilities) ineffectiveness (Mwh, tonnes) fixed price £m £m £m £m|g Ineffectiveness recognised in the period £m| |---|---|---| Sale of power                          7,931,837   £59.96         (6.1)       59.5     (67.6) 6.1 – Purchase of CO2 emissions allowances     2,898,000 €18.83 15.7         16.1      (0.5) (15.7) – Financial contracts Financial coal                          540,000   £86.40 (1.2)        0.5      (0.9 1.2           – ----- 190 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2019 ----- 7.2 Financial risk management continued 7.2.2 Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to the fluctuations in foreign currency rates resulting from committed and forecast transactions in foreign currencies, principally in relation to purchases of fuel for use in the Generation business. These purchases are typically denominated in US dollars (USD), Canadian dollars (CAD) or Euros (EUR). The Group also has a limited exposure to translation risk in relation to its net investment in its US subsidiary, Drax Biomass Inc.

The Group designates certain currency derivatives as hedging instruments under cash flow hedge accounting. As such other components of equity are sensitive to the strengthening/weakening of other currencies in relation to the impact on the hedge reserve of these movements. Foreign currency risk management It is the Group’s policy to hedge material transactional exposures using a variety of derivatives to fix the sterling value of foreign currency cash flows, except where there is an economic hedge inherent in the transaction. The Group enters into derivative contracts in line with the currency risk management policy, including forwards and options, to manage the risks associated with its anticipated foreign currency requirements over a rolling five-year period, covering contracted exposures and a proportion of highly probable forecast transactions. In addition, in order to optimise the cost of funding, the Group has issued foreign currency denominated debt in US dollars (see note 4.3). The Group utilises derivative contracts to manage exchange risk on foreign currency debt. Hedge accounting The Group designates certain foreign currency derivatives as hedging instruments. Foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as hedges are transferred from equity to inventory for hedges of fuel purchases or transferred to intangible assets for hedges of carbon EUAs. Gains and losses on the cross-currency interest rate swaps are released to interest payable and similar charges and foreign exchange gains/(losses). Further details of the cross-currency interest rate swaps are provided in the interest rate risk section. The main sources of ineffectiveness relating to foreign currency hedges are timing differences and credit risk. The reconciliation of the reserves and when the amount will affect the income statement or will be removed from equity and included in the initial cost of the non-financial item are disclosed in notes 7.3 and 7.4. ----- F-106 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2019 191 ----- #### Section 7: Risk management continued 7.2 Financial risk management continued The summary of the amounts relating to the hedging instruments and any related ineffectiveness in the period is presented in the table below.

The Group has taken out a fixed-to-fixed cross-currency interest rate swap to hedge the future cash flows associated with USD $500 million 2025 fixed rate loan notes, effectively converting them to sterling fixed rate cash flows. The Group has also taken out a floating-to-fixed swap to fix the interest payments on the £375 million private placement issued in the year. As the Group has fixed most of its debt instruments interest rates swaps, at December 2019 the Group only had one floating rate debt instrument drawn, being the £125 million ESG facility issued in the year. The return generated on the Group’s cash balance, or on amounts drawn on the revolving credit facility, are also exposed to movements in short-term interest rates. The Group manages cash balances to protect against adverse changes in rates whilst retaining liquidity. Further information about the Group’s instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk and their repayment schedules is provided in note 4.3. ----- 192 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2019 ----- 7.2 Financial risk management continued Interest rate benchmark reform The only interest rate benchmark to which the Group is exposed to within its hedge accounting relationships and that is subject to interest rate benchmark reform is GBP LIBOR. This exposure relates to the hedge of the £375 million private placement using a floating-to-fixed GBP LIBOR swap maturing in 2024. The Group is closely monitoring the market and the output from the various industry working groups managing the transition to new benchmark interest rates. This includes announcements made by LIBOR regulators (including the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)) regarding the transition away from LIBOR to Sterling Overnight Index Average Rate (SONIA). The FCA has made clear that, at the end of 2021, it will no longer seek to persuade, or compel, banks to submit to LIBOR. In response to the announcements, The Group will be engaging the following work streams: risk management, tax, treasury, legal and accounting. The aim of the programme is to identify any LIBOR exposures that are within the business and prepare and deliver on an action plan to enable a smooth transition to alternative benchmark rates. This will involve considering appropriate alternative benchmark rates in line with those proposed by different working groups in the industry and engaging with counterparties to implement appropriate wording in relevant contracts. Interest rate sensitivity The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year. The analysis below shows the impact on profit after tax and other components of equity of a reasonably possible increase/ decrease in interest rates.

The Group has reduced its exposure to interest rate risk on variable rate debt through the use of floatingto-fixed interest rate swaps and therefore a change in interest rates would not have a significant effect on profit after tax. The Group designates certain floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps as hedging instruments under cash flow hedge accounting. As such other components of equity are sensitive to an increase/decrease in interest rates in relation to the impact on the hedge reserve of these movements. Interest rate risk management The Group has a risk management policy in place relating to interest rate risk. The Group policy permits, but does not require, the use of hedging instruments in order to hedge up to 100% of the Group’s current and forecast interest rate exposure. ----- F-108 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2019 193 ----- #### Section 7: Risk management continued 7.2 Financial risk management continued Hedge accounting The Group designates the floating-to-fixed GBP interest rate swap and the cross-currency interest rate swaps as hedging instruments. The GBP interest rate swap is a hedge of the interest payments relating to the £375 million private placement. The cross-currency interest swaps are hedges of the interest payments of the $500 million 2025 fixed rate loan notes, and of the USD denominated principal. As such there is both an interest element and a foreign exchange element relating to the cross-currency interest rate swaps. Gains and losses on the floating-to-fixed GBP interest rate swap are released to interest payable and similar charges at the same time as the interest expense on the hedged borrowings. Gains and losses on the cross-currency interest rate swaps are released to interest payable and similar charges at the same time as the interest expense on the hedged borrowings. Also, gains and losses that are effective at hedging the foreign exchange risk on the USD principal are released to foreign exchange gains/(losses) to offset gains and losses on retranslating the USD denominated hedged loan notes. The main sources of ineffectiveness relating to interest rate risk hedges are differences in the critical terms, differences in repricing dates and credit risk. The summary of the amounts relating to the hedging instruments and any related ineffectiveness in the period is presented in the table below. Ineffectiveness on GBP interest rate hedging instruments is recognised in interest payable and similar charges.

The Group’s ROC revenues are linked to UK RPI and its Contract for Difference revenue is linked to UK CPI. In addition, a proportion of the Group’s fuel costs are linked to US/CAD CPI. The Group has entered UK CPI swaps to hedge the future cashflows relating to a proportion of its exposure. The Group also benefits from a natural hedge arising from its inflation-linked borrowings (see note 4.3). Inflation risk sensitivity The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to inflation rates for both derivatives and non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date.

Inflation risk management The Group has a risk management policy in place relating to inflation risk. The Group policy permits, but does not require, the use of hedging instruments in order to hedge up to 100% of the Group’s current and forecast inflation exposure. Hedge accounting As the Group has contracts for which the revenue is contractually linked to either RPI or CPI inflation, the Group has been able to designate this risk component as a hedged item. Inflation swaps are utilised as the hedging instrument for this inflation risk. Gains and losses on the inflation swaps are held in the hedge reserve and reclassified to the income statement within the revenue line at the same time the revenue from the inflation linked contracts impacts on the income statement.

Liquidity needs are monitored using regular forecasting of operational cash flows and financing commitments. The Group maintains a mixture of cash and cash equivalents, committed facilities and uncommitted facilities in order to ensure sufficient funding for business requirements. In managing liquidity risk, the Group has the ability to accelerate the cash flows associated with certain working capital items (principally those related to ROC sales and Customers power sales). In each case this is undertaken on a non-recourse basis and accordingly, the ROCs and other items are derecognised from the balance sheet at the point of sale. The Group also utilises standard purchasing facilities to extend the working capital cycle, whilst still paying suppliers on time. The impact on the Group’s cash flows is described in note 4.4. The following tables set out details of the expected contractual maturity of non-derivative financial liabilities. The tables include both interest and principal cash flows. To the extent that interest flows are floating rate, the undiscounted amount is derived from interest rate curves at the balance sheet date.

Where the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to projected commodity prices, or foreign currency exchange rates, as illustrated by the yield or other forward curves existing at the reporting date. Where derivatives are expected to be gross settled the gross cash flows have been presented. Commodity contracts and forward foreign currency contracts are expected to be gross settled. Where derivatives are expected to be net settled, the net cash flows expected to occur based on the current fair value have been disclosed. Financial contracts and other foreign exchange contracts (excluding forwards) are expected to be net settled. Interest rate contracts and inflation rate contracts are presented based on net settlement of the interest rate and inflation rate differentials. Gross settlement of the principal of cross-currency interest rate swaps is expected and as such this element of the swap is presented gross.

If a large supplier were to fall into financial difficulty and/or fail to deliver against its contract with the Group, there would be additional costs associated with securing the lost goods or services from other suppliers. The Group enters into contracts for the sale of electricity to a number of counterparties. The failure of one or more of these counterparties to perform their contractual obligations may cause the Group financial distress or increase the risk profile of the Group. ----- F-112 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2019 197 ----- #### Section 7: Risk management continued 7.2 Financial risk management continued 7.2.7 Credit risk The Group’s gross exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the balance sheet date, as summarised below: As at 31 December 2019 2018 £m £m Financial assets: Cash and cash equivalents 404.1 289.0 Trade and other receivables 582.3 413.3 Other fixed asset investments 3.0 2.4 Derivative financial instruments 346.0 510.6 1,335.4 1,215.3 Trade and other receivables are stated gross of the provision for doubtful debts of £40.7 million (2018: £44.0 million) and exclude non-financial receivables such as prepayments. Of the Group‘s three operating segments, two are exposed to different levels and concentrations of credit risk, largely reflecting the number, size and nature of their respective customers. The Pellet Production segment only trades intra-group. The highest risk is in the Customers segment, with a high number of customers of varying sizes operating in a variety of markets. In particular, Opus Energy carries lower concentrations but higher levels of credit risk owing to a customer base comprised largely of smaller retail and commercial entities. In the Customers segment, credit risk is managed by checking a company’s creditworthiness and financial strength both before commencing trade and during the business relationship. Credit risk is monitored and managed by business sector. In addition, the Customers segment extended its trade credit insurance programme to increase its mitigation to credit risk. For the Generation segment, the risk arises from treasury, trading and energy procurement activities, as well as the sale of byproducts from generation activities. Wholesale counterparty credit exposures are monitored by individual counterparty and by category of credit rating. Counterparty credit exposures are subject to approved limits. The Group uses master netting agreements to reduce credit risk and net settles payments with counterparties where net settlement provisions exist. In addition, the Group employs a variety of other methods to mitigate credit risk: margining, various forms of parent company guarantee, deed of charge, cash collateral, letters of credit and surety bonds. The majority of the Generation business’s credit risk is with counterparties in related energy industries or with financial institutions. In addition, where deemed appropriate, the Group has historically purchased credit default swaps. The investment of surplus cash is undertaken with the objective of ensuring that there is sufficient liquidity at all times, so that funds are available to meet liabilities as they fall due, whilst securing a return from invested funds and preserving the capital value of those funds within Board-approved policies. These policies manage credit risk exposure by setting out minimum rating requirements, maximum investment with any one counterparty and the maturity profile. Capital management The Group manages its capital to ensure it is able to continue as a going concern; maintain a strong credit rating underpinned by robust financial metrics; invest in its core business and pay a sustainable and growing dividend while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders’ equity (excluding the hedge and cost of hedging reserves), plus net debt. Net debt is comprised of borrowings and cash and cash equivalents as disclosed in note 4.3 and 4.2 respectively.

At the inception of the hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item is documented, along with its risk management objectives. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instruments used in hedging transactions are effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items. Changes in fair value of contracts designated into such hedging relationships are recognised within the hedge reserve to the extent they are effective. The cumulative gains and losses unwind and are released as the related contracts mature and the Group take delivery of the associated commodity or currency.

A large proportion of the derivative contracts relate to foreign exchange contracts, including forward contracts, options and swaps. Consistent with prior periods, the Group has continued to designate the change in fair value of the spot rate in the Group’s cash flow hedge relationships. The Group designates the cost of hedging – being the change in fair value associated with forward points including currency basis – to equity. All amounts within the cost of hedging reserve relate to commodity price risk.

The Group also has financial asset and liabilities with certain counterparties that are subject to master netting agreements. Financial assets and liabilities do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the balance sheet, but are subject to an enforceable master netting agreement that in certain circumstances, such as a bankruptcy, would allow for the amounts to be offset and a single net amount payable.

The amount or timing of any payment is uncertain and cannot be measured reliably. Guarantees In addition to the amount drawn down against the bank loans, certain members of the Group guarantee the obligations of a number of banks in respect of letters of credit issued by those banks to counterparties of the Group. As at 31 December 2019, the Group’s contingent liability in respect of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility amounted to £77.0 million (2018: £31.8 million). The Group also guarantees obligations in the form of surety bonds with a number of insurers amounting to £96.1 million (2018: £63.7 million). 7.7 Commitments The Group has a number of financial commitments (i.e. a contractual requirement to make a cash payment in the future) that are not recorded in the balance sheet as the contract is not yet due for delivery.

To the extent these contracts relate to the purchase of wood pellets, they are not reflected elsewhere in the financial statements owing to application of the “own-use” exemption from fair value accounting to such contracts (see note 7.1). ----- #### Section 8: Reference information This section details reference information relevant to the compiling of the financial statements and provides the general information about the Group (e.g. operations and registered office). The Group also set out the basis of preparation of the accounts and general accounting policies that are not specific to any one note. 8.1 General information Drax Group plc (the Company) is incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act. The Company and its subsidiaries (together, the Group) have three principal activities: - Power generation; - Gas and electricity supply to business customers; and - Manufacturing of sustainable compressed wood pellets for use in electricity production. The Group’s activities are principally based within the UK, with the wood pellet manufacturing activities situated in the US. The address of the Company’s registered office and principal establishment is Drax Power Station, Selby, North Yorkshire, YO8 8PH, United Kingdom. A full list of operating companies of the Group is disclosed in note 5 to the Company’s separate financial statements, which follow these consolidated financial statements. 8.2 Basis of preparation Adoption of new and revised accounting standards A number of new and amended standards became effective for the first time in 2019. The Group adopted the following from 1 January 2019: IFRS 9 (amended) – Financial Instruments IFRS 16 – Leases IFRIC 23 – Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments IAS 19 (amended) – Employee Benefits IAS 28 (amended) – Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2015–2017 Cycle IFRS Practice Statement 2 Other than the adoption of IFRS 16, these updates and amendments have not had a material impact on the financial statements of the Group. The transition disclosures for IFRS 16 have been included in note 8.3. The Group has elected to early adopt the ‘Amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 7 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform’ issued in September 2019. In accordance with the transition provisions, the amendments have been adopted retrospectively to hedging relationships that existed at the start of the reporting period or were designated thereafter, and to the amount accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve at that date. The amendments are relevant to the Group given that it applies hedge accounting to its GBP LIBOR interest rate exposure on the £375 million private placement that is hedged using the floating-to-fixed GBP interest rate swap. The amendments provide temporary relief from applying specific hedge accounting requirements to hedging relationships directly affected by interest rate Interbank Offered Rates (IBOR) reform. The reliefs have the effect that IBOR reform should not generally cause hedge accounting to terminate. However, any hedge ineffectiveness continues to be recorded in the income statement. Furthermore, the amendments set out triggers for when the reliefs will end, which include the uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform no longer being present. In summary, the reliefs provided by the amendments that apply to the Group are: - When considering the ‘highly probable’ requirement, the Group is able to assume that the GBP LIBOR interest rate on which the hedged future cash flows are based is not altered as a result of IBOR reform; - In assessing the hedge effectiveness on a prospective basis, the Group is able to assume that the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument is not impacted as a result of IBOR reform; and - When the Group applies these amendments, the quantitative requirements in paragraph 28(f) of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors are not required. ----- #### Section 8: Reference information continued 8.2 Basis of preparation continued These amendments will cease to apply at the earlier of when the uncertainty regarding the timing and amount of the interest rate benchmark-based cash flows are no longer present, or the discontinuation of the hedging relationship. The additional disclosure requirements that apply as a result of applying the ‘Amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 7 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform’ have been disclosed in note 7.2. At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following new or amended standards and relevant interpretations, which have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective (and some of which were pending endorsement by the EU – marked by *): IFRS 10 (amended) – Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 (amended) – Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (2011) – effective date deferred indefinitely. IFRS 3 (amended) – Business Combinations – effective from 1 January 2020. Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (amended) – effective from 1 January 2020. IAS 1 (amended) – Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 8 (amended) Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors – effective from 1 January 2020. Annual Improvements 2018-2020 Cycle. IFRS 17 Insurance contracts – effective from 1 January 2021. Adoption of the other standards in future periods is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group. 8.3 Adoption of new accounting standards and restatement of previously reported financial statements IFRS 16 – Leases IFRS 16 supersedes IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease, SIC 15 Operating Leases and SIC 27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions involving the legal form of a lease. The Group has adopted IFRS 16 from 1 January 2019 using the modified retrospective method of adoption. Under this method, the standard is applied retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognised at the date of initial application. Consequently, comparative information in these Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2018 has not been restated. The new requirements have impacted the Group’s accounting for lease contracts. The Group’s lease portfolio predominantly relates to properties and the hire of plant and equipment at operating sites. On transition to IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019, assets controlled under lease contracts were brought onto the balance sheet as right-of-use assets, and the Group has recognised a corresponding liability for the amounts payable under the lease contracts. On transition, the Group elected to use the available practical expedient allowing the standard to only be applied to those contracts identified as leases under the previous standards. Accordingly, the definition of a lease in accordance with IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 will continue to apply to those leases entered into or modified before 1 January 2019. However, the Group has applied the new definition of a lease to all contracts entered into or modified on or after 1 January 2019. This change did not have a significant impact on the assessment of contracts that are in scope of the definition of a lease. The Group has also elected to use the recognition exemptions for lease contracts that, at the commencement date, have a lease term of 12 months or less and lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of low value (less than £3,500). Under IFRS 16, right-of-use assets are tested for impairment. This has replaced the previous requirement to recognise a provision for onerous lease contracts. ----- 8.3 Adoption of new accounting standards and restatement of previously reported financial statements continued Nature of the effect of adoption of IFRS 16 Leases previously classified as finance leases The Group has not changed the initial carrying amounts of recognised assets and liabilities at the date of initial application for leases previously classified as finance leases (i.e. the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities equal the lease assets and liabilities recognised under IAS 17). The requirements of IFRS 16 were applied to these leases from 1 January 2019 and the related amounts on the balance sheet reclassified from property, plant and equipment to right-of-use assets and borrowings to lease liabilities. Leases previously accounted for as operating leases The Group has recognised right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for those leases previously classified as operating leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. Lease liabilities were recognised based on the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application. When calculating the remaining lease payments, termination options and extension options have been considered in determining the lease term where deemed to be reasonably probable. The right-of-use assets are recognised based on the amount equal to the lease liabilities, adjusted for any related prepaid and accrued lease payments previously recognised. The Group also applied the following practical expedients as permitted by IFRS 16: - Use of a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics; - Relied on its assessment of whether leases are onerous immediately before the date of initial application; - Applied the short-term leases exemptions to leases with a lease term that ends within 12 months at the date of initial application; - For leases of low value assets, the Group has elected to recognise a lease expense on a straight-line basis; - Excluded the initial direct costs from the measurement of the right-of-use asset at the date of initial application; and - Used hindsight in determining the lease term where the contract contains options to extend or terminate the lease. Based on the above, as at 1 January 2019: - Right-of-use assets of £37.1 million were recognised and presented separately in the balance sheet. This includes the lease assets recognised previously under finance leases of £0.6 million that were reclassified from property, plant and equipment. - Additional lease liabilities of £37.6 million were recognised separately on the balance sheet. This includes £0.5 million previously recognised as finance leases that were reclassified from borrowings. Prepayments of £0.1 million and trade and other payables of £0.7 million related to previous operating leases were derecognised. The effect of adopting IFRS 16 as at 1 January 2019 is as follows: Previously reported Adjusted at 31 December balance sheet 2018 Transition at 1 January £m adjustments 2019 (Note 1) £m £m Assets Right-of-use assets                                                                    –        37.1         37.1 Property, plant and equipment 2,292.3        (0.6) 2,291.7 Trade and other receivables 468.8 (0.1) 468.7 Liabilities Trade and other payables                                                           (938.5)        0.7 (937.8) IFRS 16 lease liabilities                                                                 –       (37.6) (37.6) Borrowings (608.1)        0.5 (607.6) Total adjustment on equity: Retained profits                                                                   442.7          –      442.7 |Previously reported at 31 December 2018 Transition £m adjustments (Note 1) £m|Adjusted balance sheet at 1 January 2019 £m| |---|---| ----- Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2019 205 ----- #### Section 8: Reference information continued 8.3 Adoption of new accounting standards and restatement of previously reported financial statements continued The lease liabilities as at 1 January 2019 can be reconciled to the operating lease commitments as of 31 December 2018 as follows: £m Operating lease commitments as at 31 December 2018 30.8 Less: Effect of discounting                                                                            (5.6) Commitments relating to short-term and low-value leases (0.8) Add: Additional leases identified 9.7 Effect of rental changes 2.4 Other adjustments 1.1 Lease liabilities as at 1 January 2019 37.6 Key judgements made in response to new reporting requirements Whilst judgements have been made on initial application of IFRS 16, these are not considered significant to the Consolidated Financial Statements Impact of IFRS 16 on comparative information As the Group has made the election to adopt the modified retrospective approach, no comparative information for the 31 December 2018 has been restated for the effects of transition to the new standard. This has led to a lack of comparability in certain areas of the financial statement for the two years. Income statement Under the previous accounting standards, operating leases were expensed to the income statement on a systematic basis over the lease term, in the year ended 31 December 2018, £6.3 million was expensed to operating expenses for the operating lease rentals. Under IFRS 16, operating leases are recognised on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets with a corresponding lease liability. Interest on the lease liability is expensed to the income statement as the discount on the lease liability unwinds.

74_1,Offerings 2020.md,1270,INDEPENDENT REVIEW REPORT TO DRAX GROUP PLC,1270.7,Audited consolidated financial statements of Drax Group plc and its subsidiaries as of and for the year ended 31 December 2018,1270.7.1,,"Extracted from the 2018 annual report and accounts of Drax Group plc ----- ###### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF DRAX GROUP PLC REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Opinion In our opinion: - the financial statements of Drax Group plc (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2018 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; - the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union; - the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice including Financial Reporting Standard 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”; and - the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We have audited the financial statements which comprise: - the Consolidated income statement; - the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income; - the Consolidated and parent company balance sheets; - the Consolidated and parent company statements of changes in equity; - the Consolidated cash flow statement; - the basis of preparation and statement of accounting policies on pages 114 to 116; - the related Group notes 2.1 to 8.4; and - the related parent company notes 1 to 9 The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework” (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). BASIS FOR OPINION We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council’s (the ‘FRC’s’) Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We confirm that the non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the parent company. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. SUMMARY OF OUR AUDIT APPROACH Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were: - Presentation of the Consolidated income statement - Valuation of commodity and foreign exchange contracts - Estimation of retail unbilled revenue - Accounting for the acquisition of Drax Generation Enterprise Limited (Scottish Power assets) Within this report, any new key audit matters are identified with and any key audit matters which are the same as the prior year identified with . Materiality The materiality that we used for the Group financial statements was £7.6m (2017: £6.8m). This was determined taking into consideration a number of metrics, but with particular focus on Earnings before Interest, Taxation, Depreciation and Amortisation (Adjusted EBITDA) which excludes the impact of exceptional items and certain remeasurements, as this measure is of direct relevance to readers of the financial statements. Our selected materiality represents approximately 3.0% of Adjusted EBITDA for the year (2017: 2.9% of Adjusted EBITDA). Scoping We focused our Group audit scope primarily on the audit work at five locations, being Drax Power, Haven Power, Opus Energy, Drax Biomass and Drax Generation Enterprise Limited. These were subject to a full scope audit, other than Drax Biomass and Drax Generation Enterprise Limited which were subject to specific audit procedures to support our Group audit opinion. These five locations represent the principal business units and account for virtually all of the Group’s net assets, revenue and profit before tax. ----- SUMMARY OF OUR AUDIT APPROACH CONTINUED Significant changes in our approach The following changes were made to the key audit matters reported in the prior year: - We have included as a key audit matter the presentation of the Consolidated income statement covering both exceptional items and certain remeasurements; - We have also included the accounting for the acquisition of Drax Generation Enterprise Limited as a new acquisition in the year; and - The risk of impairment at Drax Power is no longer a key audit matter given the levels of headroom in both the previous and current year. In the current year, our Group audit scope was extended to include Drax Generation Enterprise Limited following its acquisition by the Group on 31 December 2018. Other aspects of our audit approach remain broadly consistent with the prior year. CONCLUSIONS RELATING TO GOING CONCERN, PRINCIPAL RISKS AND VIABILITY STATEMENT Going concern We have reviewed the directors’ statement on page 42-43 to the financial statements concerning whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements and their identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s and company’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements. We considered as part of our risk assessment the nature of the Group, its business model and related risks including where relevant the impact of Brexit, the requirements of the applicable financial reporting framework and the system of internal control. We evaluated the directors’ assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, including challenging the underlying data and key assumptions used to make the assessment, and evaluated the directors’ plans for future actions in relation to their going concern assessment. We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to that statement required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) and report if the statement is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit. Principal risks and viability statement Based solely on reading the directors’ statements and considering whether they were consistent with the knowledge we obtained in the course of the audit, including the knowledge obtained in the evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the Group’s and the company’s ability to continue as a going concern, we are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to: - the disclosures on pages 44-49 that describe the principal risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated; - the directors’ confirmation on page 44 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity; or - the directors’ explanation on page 42 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions. We are also required to report whether the directors’ statement relating to the prospects of the Group required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit. We confirm that we have nothing material to report, add or draw attention to in respect of these matters. We confirm that we have nothing material to report, add or draw attention to in respect of these matters. KEY AUDIT MATTERS Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements for the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We previously identified the risk of asset impairment at Drax Power as a key audit matter reflecting the significant management ----- Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 107 ----- ###### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF DRAX GROUP PLC continued PRESENTATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT Key audit matter description How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter In the current year, the Group has changed the presentation of its Consolidated income statement set out on page 118 of the Annual Report. The Consolidated income statement now segregates Adjusted results from Exceptional items and certain remeasurements (the ‘Middle column’) in arriving at the results for the year. The prior year Consolidated income statement has been restated on a consistent basis. Further detail is disclosed in the Group’s critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions set out on pages 114 to 116, note 2.7 Certain remeasurements and exceptional items and the Audit Committee report on pages 69 to 74. The Adjusted results are a critical measure for stakeholders and underpin the Group’s segmental analysis and description of business results and therefore the classification of items between Adjusted results and the Middle column is important for users of the accounts. The key items included within the Middle column are as follows: - Remeasurement of certain energy contracts; - Asset obsolescence charges; - Acquisition and restructuring costs; - Debt restructuring costs; and - Related tax charges and credits. The Group has established a policy which governs which items are exceptional and should be recognised in the Middle column. However, judgement is applied in the application of this policy, and whether the above items meet the definition under the policy to be presented within the Middle column. This is a key area of audit focus for us. Certain remeasurements comprise unrealised gains or losses on derivative contracts to the extent that those contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, or hedge accounting is not effective. Such gains and losses are reclassified into Adjusted results when the related contract leads to a physical sale or purchase. The effect of excluding certain remeasurements from the Adjusted result is to reflect commodity sales and purchases at contracted prices in those Adjusted results. There is a risk that adjusted profit measures are misleading and that the principles used to determine the classification as exceptional are not in line with relevant guidance, substantiated or applied on a consistent basis. This also represents a possible fraud risk in relation to the allocation of items to the Middle column. We assessed the design and implementation of key controls around the presentation of items within either Adjusted results or the Middle column. We evaluated the Group’s accounting policy for exceptional items and certain remeasurements against guidance issued by the FRC and European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) regarding the publication of transparent, unbiased and comparable financial information. We considered management’s rationale for the treatment of exceptional items presented, and performed an independent assessment of the selection and presentation of each item against the Group’s accounting policies and relevant regulatory guidance. We challenged management over the principles used to determine items as exceptional, assessing whether the application of the Group’s policy was appropriate and consistent. For the remeasurement of certain derivative contracts and the recycling of fair value movements to either revenue or cost of sales on realisation, we reviewed relevant accounting literature in order to determine whether the approach adopted was appropriate. The accounting standards for this are subject to interpretation and are currently being reviewed by the International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretation Committee (‘IFRIC’). However, their draft determination supports the Group’s new presentation of the Consolidated income statement. We reviewed the presentation and disclosure of management’s conclusions in the Annual Report & Accounts to assess whether the disclosures are consistent with the Group’s policy and relevant accounting standards. Key observations We are satisfied that the items presented as exceptional and within certain remeasurements in the Financial Statements are materially in compliance with the Group’s accounting policies, applicable accounting standards and guidance, and are clearly described to readers of the Annual Report and Accounts. We are satisfied that the prior year Consolidated income statement has been represented on a basis consistent with the new format adopted for 2018. The majority of acquisition and restructuring costs relate to the Scottish Power acquisition (£21m). However, there are certain smaller costs incurred in the year which relate to restructuring activities in other areas of the business, and which have been treated as exceptional items, and presented within the Middle column in the Consolidated income statement. Whilst the treatment of these costs as exceptional is subjective, the costs incurred are not material to the Financial Statements. ----- VALUATION OF COMMODITY AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS Key audit matter description How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter Net Gains on derivative contracts recognised in the Consolidated income statement in the year are £38.4m (2017: losses of £176.9m), with related derivative assets of £510.6m and liabilities of £151.4m recognised on the balance sheet as at 31 December 2018. Further detail of the key judgements are disclosed in the Group’s critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions set out on pages 114 to 116 and the Audit Committee report on pages 69 to 74. Section 7 sets out the financial risk management notes. The Group has exposure to a number of different financial risks including foreign exchange risk and commodity risk, and use a variety of derivative contracts to mitigate these risks, including commodity contracts, floating swap forwards and cross currency swaps. The valuation of derivative contracts is complex and requires judgement in areas including the selection of appropriate valuation methodologies, and assumptions in respect of future market prices and credit risk factors. Due to the large amount of data involved in the contract valuations, and the requirement for certain manual adjustments, we have identified a fraud risk relating to the potential for management or employees of the company to value trades inappropriately. We evaluated the design and implementation and tested the operating effectiveness of key controls related to the valuation of commodity and foreign exchange contracts. We used our internal financial instrument specialists to test management’s key judgements and calculations, including testing a sample of trades undertaken to trade tickets, confirming key contractual terms such as volumes and contracted prices. We have assessed the valuation models used by management, including any manual adjustments to determine the fair value of the derivative instruments and performed independent valuations across a sample of both commodity and foreign exchange contracts. We have analysed the appropriateness of management’s forward price curve assumptions by benchmarking these to third party sources and reviewed the consistency of the assumptions used across other areas of the financial statements, such as asset impairment. We have challenged management’s approach and assumptions involved in assessing fair value adjustments such as credit risk, time value of money and spread adjustments. Key observations From our testing, we are satisfied that the valuation of commodity and foreign exchange contracts is reasonable. We consider the valuation models used by management to be appropriate and the forward curve assumptions adopted are within an acceptable range. ESTIMATION OF RETAIL UNBILLED REVENUE Key audit matter description How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter The recognition of retail revenue requires an estimation of customer usage between the date of the last meter reading and year end, which is known as unbilled revenue. Across the retail division, unbilled revenue at the balance sheet date amounted to £146.5m (2017: £195m) Further detail of the key judgements are disclosed in the Group’s critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions set out on pages 114 to 116 and the Audit Committee report on pages 69 to 74. Accrued income is disclosed in note 3.5. The method of estimating unbilled revenue is complex and judgemental and requires assumptions for both the volumes of energy consumed by customers and the related value. We identified a fraud risk in relation to revenue recognition in the retail businesses, in particular to the estimates underpinning unbilled revenue, as these judgemental areas could be manipulated by management to mis-report revenue. We evaluated the design and implementation and tested the operating effectiveness of key controls related to the estimation of unbilled revenue. This included controls over the reconciliation of meter readings provided by the energy markets, and which are used by management to estimate the power supplied. We also tested the controls over the price per unit applied in the valuation of unbilled revenue. When external market information was not available at the balance sheet date, we obtained and considered management’s reconciliation of the volume of power purchased to their calculations of revenue supplied and completed sample tests to check that the December 2018 unbilled revenue amount was subsequently billed. We also reviewed the aggregate unbilled revenue balance from previous periods to test that the amounts recognised were subsequently billed in line with the values accrued. Key observations Our retrospective reviews of estimated revenues found that management have historically achieved a high level ----- ###### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF DRAX GROUP PLC continued ACCOUNTING FOR THE ACQUISITION OF DRAX GENERATION ENTERPRISE LIMITED Key audit matter description How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter On 31 December 2018, the Group acquired Drax Generation Enterprise Limited for £686.9m. In accordance with IFRS 3 “Business Combinations”, management has recognised the identifiable assets and the liabilities at their acquisition date fair values. Further detail of the key judgements are disclosed in the Group’s critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions set out on pages 114 to 116, the Audit Committee report on pages 69 to 74, and the acquisition note at 5.1. We have identified a key audit matter in relation to the assumptions applied in respect of the Purchase Price Allocation (PPA) exercise, identifying in particular judgement related to the fair value of property, plant and equipment (PP&E), goodwill and any intangible assets arising. Goodwill of £74.8m has been recognised. We evaluated the design and implementation of key controls related to the acquisition process. We tested the acquisition balance sheet and initial fair value adjustments of the acquired businesses including challenging management with regards to the identification and valuation of PP&E, the recognition of intangible assets and identification of liabilities. This was performed by assessing the adjustments applied to the acquired assets and liabilities and determining whether these have been appropriately recorded at fair value. We considered the expertise and approach taken by third party experts engaged by management to perform the PPA exercise. We evaluated the valuation work undertaken to support the acquisition, and whether contradictory evidence to the valuations adopted existed. We also used our internal valuation specialists to review the third party report and identify areas for particular focus in our work. Key observations Based on the work performed, we are satisfied that the acquired businesses have been appropriately accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3 “Business Combinations”. Initial judgements in valuing PP&E in particular have been applied, including in the determination of depreciated replacement cost values. The disclosures in note 5.1 make clear that the valuation is preliminary and there could be further amendments as the valuations are finalised, in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 3. OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work. Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows: Group financial statements Parent company financial statements Materiality £7.6m (2017: £6.8m) £4.6m (2017: £4.1m) We have capped materiality at 60% of the materiality identified for the Group. This is a judgement and reflects the significant value of investments held on the balance sheet at the year end (£717.0m). When determining materiality, we considered the net assets of the company as its principal activity is as an investment holding company for the Group. Basis for determining materiality Rationale for the benchmark applied We have determined materiality by considering a range of possible benchmarks but with a particular focus on Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the impact of exceptional items and certain measurements, together with profit before and after interest and tax as well as the scale of the balance sheet and the overall size of the business. Our selected materiality represents a approximately 3.0% of Adjusted EBITDA for the year (2017: 2.9% of Adjusted EBITDA) When determining materiality, we have considered the size and scale of the business and the nature of its operations. We have also considered which benchmarks would be of relevance to the users of the financial statements and those applied to the audit of similar businesses. We consider that Adjusted EBITDA is of particular relevance to users of the financial statements and is a key measure of performance used by the Group, and excludes volatility caused in particular by the remeasurements of derivative contracts. We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £0.4m (2017: £0.3m) for the parent company and Group, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation ----- AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including group-wide controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. Based on that assessment, we focused our group audit scope primarily on the audit work at five locations, being Drax Power, Haven Power, Opus Energy, Drax Biomass and Drax Generation Enterprise Limited. These represent the principal business units of the Group and account for virtually all of the Group’s net assets, revenue and profit before tax. This is in line with 2017, other than Drax Generation Enterprise Limited which is new in the year. A full scope audit was performed for Drax Power, Haven Power and Opus Energy. For Drax Generation Enterprise Limited and Drax Biomass, specific audit procedures were performed in order to support the Group audit opinion. This scope was selected to provide an appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement identified above. Our audit work at all locations was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity which were lower than Group materiality and ranged from £3.0m to £5.3m (2017: £3.5m to £5.2m). At the Group level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject to audit or audit of specified account balances. During 2018 the Senior Statutory Auditor visited Drax Power, and other senior team members also visited Drax Generation Enterprise Limited, Opus Energy and Haven Power. The Senior Statutory Auditor visited Drax Biomass in the US in 2017. In previous years, a US component team performed the audit of Drax Biomass. In the current year, the Group audit team has performed this audit, following a restructuring of Drax Biomass resulting in more of the finance function being controlled from the UK. OTHER INFORMATION The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. In this context, matters that we are specifically required to report to you as uncorrected material misstatements of the other information include where we conclude that: - Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the directors on page 104 that they consider the annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or - Audit committee reporting – the section describing the work of the audit committee on pages 69 to 74 does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the audit committee; or - Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code – the parts of the directors’ statement on page 58 required under the Listing Rules relating to the company’s compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to report in respect of these matters RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. ----- Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 111 ----- ###### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF DRAX GROUP PLC continued AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. Details of the extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud are set out below. A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: [www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description](http://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities) forms part of our auditor’s report. EXTENT TO WHICH THE AUDIT WAS CONSIDERED CAPABLE OF DETECTING IRREGULARITIES, INCLUDING FRAUD We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and then design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, including obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Identifying and assessing potential risks related to irregularities In identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations, our procedures included the following: - enquiring of management, internal audit and the audit committee, including obtaining and reviewing supporting documentation, concerning the Group’s policies and procedures relating to: –identifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any instances of non-compliance; –detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud; –the internal controls established to mitigate risks related to fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations; - discussing among the engagement team including all component audit teams and involving relevant internal specialists, including tax, pensions, IT and financial instrument specialists, regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and any potential indicators of fraud. As part of this discussion, we identified the potential for possible fraud risk in the following areas: the impairment of fixed assets, the valuation of commodity and foreign exchange contracts, the cut off risk for unbilled and billed revenue, the presentation of the Consolidated income statement and the use of working capital transactions to potentially enhance cashflows; and - obtaining an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that the Group operates in, focusing on those laws and regulations that had a direct effect on the financial statements or that had a fundamental effect on the operations of the Group. The key laws and regulations we considered in this context included the UK Companies Act, Listing Rules, Pensions legislation, Tax legislation, and Regulations established by regulators in the key markets in which the Group operates, including the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem). Audit response to risks identified As a result of performing the above, we identified the presentation of the Consolidated income statement, valuation of commodity and foreign exchange contracts and estimation of retail unbilled revenue as key audit matters. The key audit matters section of our report explains the matters in more detail and also describes the specific procedures we performed in response to those key audit matters. In addition to the above, our procedures to respond to risks identified included the following: - reviewing the financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with relevant laws and regulations discussed above; - enquiring of management, the audit committee and in-house legal counsel concerning actual and potential litigation and claims; - performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of material misstatement due to fraud; - reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance, reviewing internal audit reports and reviewing correspondence with HMRC; - in addressing the risk of fraud in the impairment of fixed assets, we have challenged management’s underlying assumptions and future cash flow forecasts, benchmarked key market related assumptions including future commodity prices, support mechanisms and discount rates against external data where available, and run sensitivity analysis to assess whether an impairment would be required if a range of more conservative assumptions were adopted; - in addressing the risk of fraud in revenue recognition, we have performed focussed testing on trades close to the year end combined with analytical review procedures to assess accuracy and completeness of revenue recognised; - in addressing the risk of fraud in the use of working capital transactions, we have challenged management on the rationale for all transactions entered into and reviewed the accounting treatments adopted by management against the specific contractual terms and arrangements associated with each individual transaction and reviewed the related disclosures in the financial statements; and ----- - in addressing the risk of fraud through management override of controls, testing the appropriateness of journal entries and other adjustments; assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias; and evaluating the business rationale of any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business. We also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement team members including internal specialists and significant component audit teams, and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations throughout the audit. REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 In our opinion the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: - the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and - the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and of the parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report. Matters on which we are required to report by exception Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: - we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or - adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or - the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. Directors’ remuneration Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration have not been made or the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.

James Leigh FCA (Senior statutory auditor) For and on behalf of Deloitte LLP Statutory Auditor London, United Kingdom 25 February 2019 ----- Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 113 ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INTRODUCTION The consolidated financial statements provide detailed information about the financial performance (Consolidated income statement), financial position (Consolidated balance sheet), and cash flows (Consolidated cash flow statement) of Drax Group plc (the Company) together with all of the entities controlled by the Company (collectively, the Group). The notes to the financial statements provide additional information on the items in the Consolidated income statement, Consolidated balance sheet and Consolidated cash flow statement. The notes include explanations of the information presented. In general, the additional information in the notes to the financial statements is required by law, International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) or other regulations to facilitate increased understanding of the primary statements set out on pages 118-122. BASIS OF PREPARATION The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and therefore the consolidated financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation and the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value (principally derivative financial instruments and those acquired as part of business combinations) and the assets and liabilities of the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes (measured at fair value and using the projected unit credit method respectively). Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items are not retranslated. Foreign exchange gains and losses arising on such revaluations are recognised in the income statement within finance costs. Foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations with a functional currency other than sterling are translated into sterling using published exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenditure of such operations are translated into sterling using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the retranslation of the operation’s net assets and its results for the year are recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Going concern The Group’s business activities, along with future developments that may affect its financial performance, position and cash flows, are discussed within the Strategic report on pages 1 to 49 of this Annual Report. In the viability statement on page 42 the directors state that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the next three years Consequently, the directors also have a reasonable expectation that the Group will continue in existence for the next 12 months and, therefore, have adopted the going concern basis in preparing these financial statements. Basis of consolidation These consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial results of the Company and of all entities controlled by the Company, (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. The Company owns 100% of the equity of all subsidiaries. The Group acquired and gained control of ScottishPower Generation Limited (subsequently renamed Drax Generation Enterprise Limited), a company that owns and operates a portfolio of UK hydro, pumped storage and gas-fired generation assets, at 23:59 on 31 December 2018 (the Acquired Generation Business). The assets and liabilities acquired have been included in the Group’s Consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2018. Due to the timing of the acquisition, no income, expenditure or cash flows are included in the Group’s consolidated financial statements in respect of the Acquired Generation Business. ACCOUNTING POLICIES The significant accounting policies for the measurement of an individual item in the financial statements are described in the note to the financial statements relating to the item concerned (see contents on page 117). The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the Group’s annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017, except for the adoption of new standards effective as of 1 January 2018. The Group has not early-adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective. A full listing of new standards, interpretations and pronouncements under IFRS applicable to these financial statements is presented in note 8.2. The application of new requirements has not had a material effect on the financial statements, other than in respect of IFRS 9. The transition to IFRS 9 is described in note 8.3. Note 8.2 also includes the anticipated impact of IFRS 16 which will affect the financial statements in future periods. JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements requires judgement to be applied in forming the Group’s accounting policies. It also requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, with revisions recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. The judgements involving a higher degree of estimation or complexity are set out below and in more detail, including sensitivity analysis where appropriate, in the related notes. ----- Critical accounting judgements The critical judgements made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies during the year that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are set out below. Capacity market – on 15 November 2018 the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union found in favour of a claim against the European Commission, annulling the Commission’s State aid approval of the UK Capacity Market. This ruling imposed a standstill period on the Capacity Market, with payments under existing contracts and future capacity auctions suspended indefinitely until reapproval. The Government have since announced that they expect the Capacity Market to be reinstated during 2019, and that back-dated payments will be made to generators who have complied with their capacity obligations during the standstill period. Following the ruling, the Group ceased to accrue capacity market income in Generation. Revenue accrued but unpaid during the period from 1 October was derecognised due to the current uncertainty over the recovery of these amounts (totalling £7 million). Reflecting previous Government consultations and the announcement on 7 February 2019 that the Collection Agent expects to recommence collection of the supplier charge from March 2019, including amounts relating to the standstill period, Capacity Market costs have been accrued in the B2B Energy Supply business in full. The impact of this approach on the Group’s financial statements is a reduction in revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of approximately £7 million. See note 7.6 on page 171 On the basis the Group expects the Capacity Market to be reinstated during 2019, with back-payments made to generators, the suspension has not had a material impact on estimates of future cash flows for the purpose of impairment analyses in the Generation business, including the OCGT development projects. See note 2.4 on page 128 and note 5.3 on page 150 Certain remeasurements and exceptional items – management makes judgements regarding transactions to exclude from the Adjusted Results of the Group, as described under Alternative Performance Measures, below. See note 2.7 on page 132 Acquisition accounting – having assessed the circumstances of the transaction to purchase the Acquired Generation Business on 31 December 2018, it was concluded that the transaction represented the acquisition of a business and not an asset purchase. The Group acquired assets, people and processes. Accordingly, the transaction has been treated as a business combination in the financial statements. Sources of estimation uncertainty The following are the sources of estimation uncertainty that carry the most significant risk of a material effect on next year’s accounts – that is, the items where actual outcomes in the next 12 months could vary significantly from the estimates made in determining the reported amount of an asset or liability. Property, plant and equipment – property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life. Useful economic lives are estimated and based on past experience, future replacement cycles and other available evidence. Useful economic lives are reviewed annually. See note 3.1 on page 135 Fair value of acquired assets and liabilities – the assets and liabilities of the Acquired Generation Business have been recognised at fair value in the Group’s Consolidated balance sheet. The fair values of the property, plant and equipment have been calculated based on their depreciated replacement cost, before adjusting to reflect either a premium for immediate availability or a provision for economic obsolescence, as appropriate. In addition, the terms of the acquisition include a risk-sharing mechanism with the vendor that may result in a change to the overall level of consideration payable in the event UK Capacity Market payments are not received during 2019. A further payment may be made by the vendor, or by the Group, as applicable. The value and beneficiary of the further payment is dependent upon the gross profit achieved by the acquired business in 2019 and is capped at £26 million, as described in the Circular of 5 December 2018, published on the Group’s website. On the basis the Group believes that the Capacity Market will be reinstated during 2019, with back-payments made to generators, the fair value of the contingent payment at 31 December 2018 is considered to be £nil. The contingent arrangement could increase or decrease the fair value of the acquisition consideration in these financial statements by up to £26 million. See note 5.1 on page 148 Impairment – an impairment review is conducted annually of goodwill and of other assets and cash-generating units where an indicator of possible impairment exists. In 2018, an impairment assessment has been completed for three of the Group’s CGUs which have allocated goodwill or intangible assets with an indefinite life. The assessment of future cash flows that underpins such a review is based on management’s best estimate of retail margins, future commodity prices, supply volumes, the capacity market and economic conditions. See note 2.4 on page 128 and notes 5.2 and 5.3 on page 150 ----- Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 115 ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued Derivatives – derivative financial instruments are recorded in the Group’s balance sheet at fair value. The assessment of fair value is derived from assuming a market price for the instrument in question. The Group bases its assessment of market prices upon forward curves that are largely derived from readily obtainable quotations and third party sources. However, any forward curve is based at least in part upon assumptions about future transactions and market movements. Where such instruments extend beyond the liquid portion of the forward curve, the level of estimation increases as the number of observable transactions decreases. See note 7.2 on page 167 Revenue recognition – the nature of some of the Group’s activities, particularly within the B2B Energy Supply segment, results in revenue being based on the estimated volumes of power supplied to customers at an estimated average price per unit. Assumptions that underpin these estimates are applied consistently and comparison of past estimates to final settlements suggests a high degree of accuracy. However, actual outcomes may vary from initial estimates. Revenue from contracts satisfied over time is recognised in line with the progress of those contracts. Assumptions are applied consistently but actual outcomes may vary from initial estimates. See note 2.2 on page 125 Pensions – the Group records a net surplus or liability in its balance sheet for its obligation to provide benefits under approved defined benefit pension schemes, less the fair value of assets held by the pension schemes. The actuarial valuation of the scheme assets and liabilities is performed annually and depends on assumptions regarding interest rates, inflation, future salary and pension increases, mortality and other factors, any of which are subject to future change. An actuarial gain on the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme has resulted in an accounting surplus arising on the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme at 31 December 2018. The terms of the Trust Deed allow the Group to recover any surplus once the liabilities of the scheme have been settled; accordingly, the surplus has been recognised in full as a non-current asset on the balance sheet. The net surplus in 2018 includes an initial estimate of amounts due in respect of the Guaranteed Minimum Pension to equalise pension benefits for men and women, following a High Court ruling in October 2018. See note 6.3 on page 157 Taxation – in accounting for both current and deferred tax the Group makes assumptions regarding the likely treatment of items of income and expenditure for tax purposes. These assumptions are based on interpretation of relevant legislation and, where required, consultation with external advisers. See note 2.6 on page 130 ADOPTION OF IFRS 9 AND IFRS 15 In the year ended 31 December 2018, the Group has applied IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ and IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ for the first time. During the year, the Group reviewed the presentation of gains and losses on derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting in the consolidated income statement. Following this review, the Group has elected to present these amounts in the line item most closely related to the underlying commodity contract. Previously unrealised gains and losses were presented separately. In addition, the Group has elected to apply the ‘cost of hedging’ provisions of IFRS 9, resulting in certain unrealised gains and losses previously recognised in the income statement being recognised in reserves. Both of these changes have been applied retrospectively and the prior year financial statements have been restated. See note 8.3 for further details. Adoption of IFRS 15 has not resulted in any changes to the timing or amount of revenue recognised. See note 8.3 for further details. ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES (APMS) The Group’s financial performance for the period, measured in accordance with IFRS, is shown in the “Total Results” column on the face of the income statement. Exceptional items and certain remeasurements are deducted from the Total Results in arriving at the “Adjusted Results” for the year. The Group’s Adjusted Results are consistent with the way executive management and the Board assess the performance of the Group, and are intended to reflect the underlying trading performance of the Group’s businesses and are presented to assist users of the accounts in evaluating the Group’s trading performance and performance against strategic objectives. Exceptional items are those transactions that, by their nature, do not reflect the trading performance of the Group in the period. For a transaction to be considered exceptional, management considers the nature of the transaction, the frequency of similar events, previous precedent and commercial context. Exceptional items are approved by the Audit Committee. Certain remeasurements comprise fair value gains and losses on derivative forward contracts to the extent those contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, or hedge accounting is not effective, which under IFRS are recorded in revenue or cost of sales as described above. The Group regards all of its forward contracting activity to represent an economic hedge. The impact of excluding these fair value remeasurements is to reflect commodity sales and purchases at contracted prices (the price paid or received in respect of delivery of the commodity in question), taking into account the impact of financial trading (such as forward foreign currency purchases), in the Adjusted Results. Further information on exceptional items and certain remeasurements in the current and previous period is included in note 2.7 to the financial statements. The Group presents an additional subtotal in the Adjusted Results column. Adjusted EBITDA is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, excluding the impact of exceptional items and certain remeasurements. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by the Board and executive management to assess the financial performance of the Group. ----- ###### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTENTS - SECTION 1 ###### CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 118 Consolidated income statement 119 Consolidated statement of comprehensive income 120 Consolidated balance sheet 121  Consolidated statement of changes in equity 122 Consolidated cash flow statement - SECTION 2 ###### FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 123 2.1 Segmental reporting 125 2.2 Revenue 127 2.3 Operating expenses 128 2.4 Review of fixed assets for impairment 129 2.5 Net finance costs 130 2.6 Current and deferred taxation 132 2.7 Certain remeasurements and exceptional items 133 2.8 Earnings per share 134 2.9 Dividends 134 2.10 Retained profits - SECTION 3 ###### OPERATING ASSETS AND WORKING CAPITAL 135 3.1 Property, plant and equipment 137 3.2 Other fixed asset investments 138 3.3 ROC assets 138 3.4 Inventories 139 3.5 Trade and other receivables 141 3.6 Contract costs 141 3.7 Trade and other payables - SECTION 4 ###### FINANCING AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE 142 4.1 Reconciliation of net debt 142 4.2 Cash and cash equivalents 142 4.3 Borrowings 145 4.4 Cash generated from operations 146 4.5 Equity and reserves - SECTION 5 ###### OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES 148 5.1 Acquisitions 149 5.2 Goodwill 150 5.3 Intangible assets 152 5.4 Provisions - SECTION 6 ###### OUR PEOPLE 153 6.1 Employees and directors 153 6.2 Share-based payments 157 6.3 Retirement benefit obligations - SECTION 7 ###### RISK MANAGEMENT 163 7.1 Financial risk management 167 7.2 Derivative financial instruments 169 7.3 Other financial instruments 170 7.4 Hedge reserve 171  7.5 Cost of hedging reserve 171  7.6 Contingent assets and liabilities 172 7.7 Commitments - SECTION 8 ###### REFERENCE INFORMATION 173 8.1 General information 173 8.2 Basis of preparation 175 8.3 Adoption of new accounting standards and change in presentation of income statement 177 8.4 Related party transactions 178 8.5 Unaudited Pro forma financial information of the enlarged group ###### DRAX GROUP PLC 182 Company financial statements 184 Notes to the Company financial statements ----- Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 117 ----- ###### SECTION 1: CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT Year ended 31 December 2018 Year ended 31 December 2017 Restated[(5)] Exceptional Exceptional items and items and certain certain Adjusted remeasure- Total Adjusted remeasure- Total Results[(1)] ments Results Results[(1)] ments Results Notes £m £m £m £m £m £m Revenue 2.2 4,237.3 (8.3) 4,229.0 3,685.2 (0.9) 3,684.3 Cost of sales (3,636.3) 46.7 (3,589.6) (3,140.2) (176.0) (3,316.2) Gross profit 601.0 38.4 639.4 545.0 (176.9) 368.1 Operating and administrative expenses 2.3 (320.0) – (320.0) (297.4) – (297.4) Impairment losses on trade receivables 3.5 (31.4) – (31.4) (18.7) – (18.7) Adjusted EBITDA[(2) ] 249.6 228.9 Depreciation 3.1 (129.2) – (129.2) (122.7) – (122.7) Amortisation 5.3 (44.6) – (44.6) (43.6) – (43.6) Asset obsolescence charge 3.1 – (26.8) (26.8) – – – Losses on disposals 3.1 (3.9) – (3.9) (15.4) – (15.4) Other gains/(losses) 4.1 – 4.1 (0.4) – (0.4) Acquisition and restructuring costs[(3)] 2.7 – (27.7) (27.7) – (7.8) (7.8) Operating profit/(loss) 76.0 (16.1) 59.9 46.8 (184.7) (137.9) Foreign exchange gains/(losses) 2.5 0.3 – 0.3 (10.6) – (10.6) Interest payable and similar charges [(4][)] 2.5 (40.4) (7.2) (47.6) (31.5) (24.2) (55.7) Interest receivable 2.5 1.2 – 1.2 0.2 – 0.2 Profit/(loss) before tax 37.1 (23.3) 13.8 4.9 (208.9) (204.0) Tax: – Before effect of changes in rate of tax 2.6 0.2 1.6 1.8 3.2 38.3 41.5 – Prior year patent box credit 2.6 4.8 – 4.8 10.3 – 10.3 – Effect of changes in rate of tax 2.6 (0.2) – (0.2) (15.7) – (15.7) Total tax credit/(charge) 4.8 1.6 6.4 (2.2) 38.3 36.1 Profit/(loss) for the year attributable to equity holders 41.9 (21.7) 20.2 2.7 (170.6) (167.9) Earnings/(loss) per share Pence Pence Pence Pence – Basic 2.8 10.4 5.0 0.7 (41.3) – Diluted 2.8 10.3 4.9 0.7 (40.9) All results relate to continuing operations.

There were no material non-cash transactions in either the current or previous year. The Group recorded a net loss of £21.7 million arising on exceptional items and certain remeasurements in the Consolidated income statement in 2018. Acquisition and restructuring costs of £27.7 million are included in cash generated from operations (see note 4.4) and cash paid in respect of debt restructuring of £2.0 million in cash used in financing activities. All other exceptional items and remeasurements are non-cash and adjusted in the reconciliation shown in note 4.4. ----- ###### SECTION 2: FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE The financial performance section gives further information about the items in the Consolidated income statement. It includes a summary of financial performance by each of the Group’s businesses (note 2.1), analysis of certain income statement items (notes 2.2–2.6) and information regarding the Adjusted and Total Results, distributable profits and dividends (notes 2.7–2.10). Further commentary on the Group’s trading and operational performance during the year, which is predominantly reflected in Adjusted EBITDA, can be found in the Strategic report on pages 1 to 49, with particular reference to key transactions and market conditions that have affected the results. 2.1 SEGMENTAL REPORTING The Group is organised into three businesses, with a dedicated management team for each and a central corporate office providing certain specialist and shared functions. Our businesses are: - Power Generation: power generation activities in the UK; - Pellet Production: production of sustainable compressed wood pellets at our processing facilities in the US; and - B2B Energy Supply: supply of electricity and gas to business customers in the UK. The generation assets acquired from ScottishPower will form part of the Power Generation segment. No profit or loss has been recognised in respect of these assets in 2018 as the assets were acquired at 23:59 on 31 December 2018. The operating segments are consistent with the prior year. Each business is an operating segment for the purpose of segmental reporting. Information reported to the Board for the purposes of assessing performance and making investment decisions is based on these three operating segments. The measure of profit or loss for each reportable segment presented to the Board on a regular basis is Adjusted EBITDA (as defined on page 116). Operating costs are allocated to segments to the extent they are directly attributable to the activities of that segment. Corporate office costs are included within central costs. Segment revenues and results The following is an analysis of the Group’s performance by reporting segment for the year ended 31 December 2018. The Board monitors the Adjusted Results for the Group by operating segment as presented in the tables below: Year ended 31 December 2018 Exceptional items and certain Power B2B Energy Pellet Intra-group Adjusted remeasure- Total Generation Supply Production eliminations Results ments Results £m £m £m £m £m £m £m Revenue External sales 1,994.9 2,242.4 – – 4,237.3 (8.3) 4,229.0 Inter-segment sales 1,336.7 – 213.7 (1,550.4) – – – Total revenue 3,331.6 2,242.4 213.7 (1,550.4) 4,237.3 (8.3) 4,229.0 Segment gross profit 396.0 143.4 65.1 (3.5) 601.0 38.4 639.4 Segment Adjusted EBITDA 232.4 28.2 20.8 (3.5) 277.9 Central costs (28.3) Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA 249.6 Acquisition and restructuring costs – (27.7) (27.7) Depreciation and amortisation (173.8) (26.8) (200.6) Losses on disposals (3.9) – (3.9) Other gains 4.1 – 4.1 Operating profit 76.0 (16.1) 59.9 Net finance costs (39.2) (7.2) (46.4) Foreign exchange gains 0.3 – 0.3 Profit before tax 37.1 (23.3) 13.8 ----- ###### SECTION 2: FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE continued 2.1 SEGMENTAL REPORTING continued The following is an analysis of the Group’s performance by reporting segment for the year ended 31 December 2017 (restated due to the initial application of IFRS 9, see note 8.3): Year ended 31 December 2017 (Restated) Exceptional items and certain Power B2B Energy Pellet Intra-group Adjusted remeasure- Total Generation Supply Production eliminations Results ments Results £m £m £m £m £m £m £m Revenue External sales 1,686.2 1,999.0 – – 3,685.2 (0.9) 3,684.3 Inter-segment sales 1,033.4 – 135.7 (1,169.1) – – – Total revenue 2,719.6 1,999.0 135.7 (1,169.1) 3,685.2 (0.9) 3,684.3 Segment gross profit 398.4 117.4 39.0 (9.8) 545.0 (176.9) 368.1 Segment Adjusted EBITDA 237.5 29.4 5.5 (9.8) 262.6 Central costs (33.7) Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA 228.9 Acquisition and restructuring costs – (7.8) (7.8) Depreciation and amortisation (166.3) – (166.3) Other losses (0.4) – (0.4) Loss on disposal (15.4) – (15.4) Operating profit/(loss) 46.8 (184.7) (137.9) Net finance costs (31.3) (24.2) (55.5) Foreign exchange losses (10.6) – (10.6) Profit/(loss) before tax 4.9 (208.9) (204.0) The accounting policies applied for the purpose of measuring the segments’ profits or losses, assets and liabilities are the same as those used in measuring the corresponding amounts in the Group’s financial statements. The external revenues and results of all the reporting segments are subject to seasonality, with higher dispatch and prices in the winter months compared to summer months. Capital expenditure by segment Assets and working capital are monitored on a consolidated basis; however, spend on capital projects is monitored by operating segment.

Total cash outflows in relation to capital expenditure during the year were £132.6 million (2017: £174.7 million). Key capital investments in the year include the conversion of the fourth unit at Drax Power Station to run on biomass fuel and preparatory work for the repowering of the fifth and sixth units to gas (Power Generation); investment in digital transformation in the B2B Energy Supply segment; and expansion projects in the Pellet Production segment. The prior year includes £48 million for the purchase of the LaSalle Bioenergy pellet plant. ----- 2.1 SEGMENTAL REPORTING continued Intra-group trading Intra-group transactions are carried out at management’s best estimate of arm’s-length, commercial terms that, where possible, equate to market prices at the time of the transaction. During 2018, the Pellet Production segment sold wood pellets with a total value of £213.7 million (2017: £135.7 million) to the Power Generation segment and the Power Generation segment sold electricity, gas and ROCs with a total value of £1,336.7 million (2017: £1,033.4 million) to the B2B Energy Supply segment. The impact of all intra-group transactions, including any unrealised profit arising, is eliminated on consolidation. Major customers Total consolidated revenue for the year ended 31 December 2018 includes £555.8 million from one individual customer (2017: no amounts from any individual customer) that represented 10% or more of total revenue for the year. These revenues arose in the Power Generation segment. 2.2 REVENUE Accounting policy The Group has adopted IFRS 15 for the first time in 2018. The accounting policies have been updated, however the amount and timing of revenue recognition in the Group’s financial statements is unchanged (see note 8.3). Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods or services provided to customers in the normal course of business, net of trade discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes and excluding transactions between Group companies. Revenues from the sale of electricity by our Power Generation business are measured based upon metered output delivered at rates specified under contract terms or prevailing market rates as applicable. Following conversion of the fourth unit in July 2018, three biomass-fuelled generating units at Drax Power Station earn Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) under the UK Government’s Renewables Obligation (RO) regime. The financial benefit of a ROC is recognised in the income statement at the point the relevant renewable biomass fuel is burnt and power dispatched as a reduction in the cost of the biomass fuel. A corresponding asset is recognised on the balance sheet (see note 3.3). Revenue from sale of ROCs is recognised when the ROC is transferred to a third party. The Group recognises the income or costs arising from the CfD (see below) in the income statement as a component of revenue at the point the Group meets its performance obligation under the CfD contract. This is considered to be the point at which the relevant generation is delivered and the payment becomes contractually due. Revenue from the sale of electricity and gas directly to business customers through the B2B Energy Supply business is recognised on the supply of electricity or gas when a contract exists, supply has taken place, a quantifiable price has been established or can be determined and the receivables are expected to be recovered at the point of sale. Energy supplied is measured based upon metered consumption and contractual rates; however, where a supply has taken place but is not yet measured or billed, the revenue is estimated based on consumption statistics and selling price estimates and is recognised as accrued income. Revenue for contracts satisfied over time is recognised in line with the progress of those contracts. The measurement of progress is based on cost inputs for fixed price B2B Energy Supply contracts, and volume supplied for other contracts. Assumptions are applied consistently but third party costs can be variable, therefore actual outcomes may vary from initial estimates. The Group is eligible for, and therefore applies, the practical expedient available in IFRS 15 and has not disclosed information related to the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations. The right to receive consideration from a customer is at an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Group’s performance completed to date. Other revenues derived from the provision of services to National Grid (for example, the supply of system support services) are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contractual performance obligations. Most such contracts are for the delivery of a service either continually or on an ad-hoc basis over a period of time and thus stage of completion is calculated by reference to the amount of the contract term that has elapsed. Depending on the contract terms this approach may require judgement in estimating probable future outcomes. Other revenues derived from the sale of goods (for example, by-products from electricity generation such as ash and gypsum) are recognised at the point the control of the goods is transferred to the customer, typically at the point of delivery to the customer’s premises. ----- ###### SECTION 2: FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE continued 2.2 REVENUE continued CfD payments The Group is party to a Contract for Difference (CfD) with the Low Carbon Contracts Company (LCCC), a Government-owned entity responsible for delivering elements of the Government’s Electricity Market Reform Programme. Under the contract, the Group makes or receives payments in respect of electricity dispatched from a specific biomass-fuelled generating unit. The payment is calculated by reference to a strike price of £100 per MWh. The base year for the strike price was 2012 and it increases each year in line with the UK Consumer Price Index and changes in system balancing costs. The strike price at 31 December 2018 was £111 per MWh. When market prices at the point of generation are above/below the strike price, the Group makes/receives an additional payment to/ from LCCC equivalent to the difference between the market power price at the point of dispatch and the strike price. Such payments are in addition to amounts received from the sale of the power in the wholesale market and either increase or limit the total income from the power dispatched from the relevant generating unit to the strike price in the CfD contract. ROC sales The generation and sale of ROCs is a key driver of the Group’s financial performance. The RO scheme places an obligation on electricity suppliers to source an increasing proportion of their electricity from renewable sources. Under the RO, ROCs are certificates issued to generators of renewable electricity which are then sold to bilateral counterparties, including suppliers to demonstrate that they have fulfilled their obligations under the RO. ROCs are managed in compliance periods (CPs), running from April to March annually, CP1 commenced in April 2002. At 31 December 2018 we are in CP17. To meet its obligations a supplier can either submit ROCs or pay the “buy-out” price at the end of the CP. The buy-out price was set at £30 per ROC in CP1 and rises with inflation. The buy-out price in CP17 is £47.22. ROCs are typically procured in arm’s-length transactions with renewable generators at a market price typically slightly lower than the buy-out price for that CP. At the end of the CP, the amounts collected from suppliers paying the buy-out price form the “recycle fund”, which is distributed on a pro-rata basis to ROC generators. The financial benefit of a ROC recognised in the income statement at the point of generation is thus comprised of two parts: the expected value to be obtained in a sale transaction with a third party supplier and the expected recycle fund benefit to be received at the end of the CP. During the year, the Group made sales (and related purchases) of ROCs to help optimise our working capital position. External sales of ROCs in the table below include £555.8 million of such sales (2017: £201.2 million), with a similar value reflected in cost of sales. See note 3.3 for further details of ROCs generated and sold by the Power Generation business and those utilised by the B2B Energy Supply business in the year.

Other non-audit fees comprised a review of IT resilience and Disaster Recovery processes. Non-audit services are approved by the Audit Committee in accordance with the policy set out on the Group‘s website [(www.drax.com/policies) and discussed further in the Audit](http://www.drax.com/policies)) Committee report on page 69. 2.4 REVIEW OF FIXED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT Accounting policy The Group reviews its fixed assets (or, where appropriate, groups of assets known as cash-generating units (CGUs)) whenever there is an indication that an impairment loss may have been suffered. The Group assesses the existence of indicators of impairment annually. The Group considers the smallest collections of assets that generate independent cash flows to be its operating entities (Drax Power, Haven Power, Opus Energy, Drax Biomass and the OCGTs) and accordingly considers the Group to be comprised of five CGUs. The assets of the Acquired Generation Business have been recognised on the Group’s Consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2018 at fair value (see note 5.1). These assets are therefore not included in the impairment review at 31 December 2018. If an indication of potential impairment exists, the recoverable amount of the asset or CGU in question is assessed with reference to the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the continuing use of the asset or CGU (value in use) or the expected price that would be received to sell the asset to another market participant (fair value less costs to sell). The initial assessment of recoverable amount is normally based on value in use. Where value in use is calculated, the assessment of future cash flows is based on the most recent approved business plan and includes all of the necessary costs expected to be incurred to generate the cash inflows from the CGU’s assets in their current state and condition, including an allocation of centrally managed costs. Central costs are only allocated where they are necessary for and directly attributable to the CGU’s activities. Future cash flows include, where relevant, contracted cash flows arising from our cash flow hedging activities and as a result the carrying amount of each CGU includes the mark-to-market value of those cash flow hedges. The additional value that could be obtained from enhancing or converting the Group’s assets is not reflected, nor the potential benefit of any future restructuring or reorganisation. In determining value in use, the estimate of future cash flows is discounted to present value using a pre-tax rate reflecting the specific risks attributable to the CGU in question. If the recoverable amount is less than the current carrying amount in the financial statements, a provision is made to reduce the carrying amount of the asset or CGU to the estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised immediately in the income statement. ----- 2.4 REVIEW OF FIXED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT continued Assessment of indicators of impairment A review of the Group’s CGUs did not give rise to any indicators of impairment. Accordingly no detailed impairment calculation has been completed for CGUs where no goodwill is allocated (Drax Power and Drax Biomass). The review considered the effect on previously calculated headroom of movements in market prices for commodities and changes in foreign exchange rates. The review also considered the impact of the recent suspension in Capacity Market payments. The Group’s core planning assumption reflects the belief that the UK electricity market needs a capacity mechanism to ensure continuity of supply and that the Capacity Market will be reinstated during 2019. As a result, estimates of future cash flows are not materially affected by the current suspension. Separate consideration has been given to the impact on the OCGT development assets, see note 5.3. 2.5 NET FINANCE COSTS Finance costs reflect expenses incurred in managing our debt structure (such as interest payable on our bonds) as well as foreign exchange gains and losses, the unwinding of discount on provisions for reinstatement of our sites at the end of their useful lives (see note 5.4) and net interest charged on the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme obligation (see note 6.3). These are offset by interest income that the Group generates through efficient use of short-term cash surpluses – for example through investment in money market funds. On 26 April 2018, the Group issued loan notes of USD $300 million, listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. The proceeds of the issue were used to repay in full the £200 million floating rate loan notes issued in 2017. Incremental costs of the new borrowing (£3.8 million) have been deferred and are being amortised over the period to maturity of the debt instrument. Deferred costs of £5.2 million in relation to the floating rate notes have been written off in the period, in addition to an early repayment charge of £2.0 million (2017: deferred costs of £10.4 million and early repayment charges of £13.8 million in relation to the refinancing of the Group’s previous debt structure). As described in note 2.7, these costs have been excluded from the Adjusted Results and are presented as exceptional items in arriving at Total Results.

Current tax is the estimated amount of tax payable on this year’s taxable profits (which are adjusted for items upon which the Group is not required to pay tax or, in some cases, for items which are not allowable for tax purposes and therefore on which additional tax is required) and adjusted for estimates for previous years. Deferred tax is an accounting adjustment which reflects where more or less tax is expected to arise in the future due to differences between the accounting and tax rules. This is reflected in differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profits. The tax credit reflects the estimated effective tax rate on the loss before tax for the Group for the year ended 31 December 2018 and the movement in the deferred tax balance in the year, so far as it relates to items recognised in the income statement. Accounting policy Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is based on the taxable profit or loss for the year in the relevant jurisdiction. Taxable profit or loss differs from profit/loss before tax as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expenditure that are either taxable or deductible in other years or never taxable/deductible. The Group’s liability (or asset) for current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the current and deferred tax are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively. Significant estimation uncertainty In accounting for taxation the Group makes assumptions regarding the treatment of items of income and expenditure for tax purposes. The Group believes that these assumptions are reasonable based on prior experience and consultation with advisers. Full provision is made for deferred taxation at the rates of tax prevailing at the period end date unless future rates have been substantively enacted. Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is considered more likely than not that they will be recovered. Where such assets relate to losses incurred by a business unit, particularly one with a history of losses, the Group seeks evidence other than its own internal forecasts to support recognition of the related deferred tax asset.

Tax for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on jurisdictional tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

Drax Power was granted a patent to protect certain intellectual property it owns and which attaches to the technology developed to manage the combustion process in generating electricity from biomass. Under UK tax legislation the Company is now entitled to apply a lower rate of tax to some of its profits each year which are derived from utilisation of that technology. Adjustments in respect of prior periods includes a claim agreed in respect of the Patent Box regime for previous years of £4.8 million (2017: £10.3 million). ----- Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 131 ----- ###### SECTION 2: FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE continued 2.6 CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAXATION continued The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities during each year are shown below.

Within the above deferred tax balances is a net deferred tax asset of £31.8 million (2017: £22.7 million) in relation to start-up losses and other temporary differences in the US-based Pellet Production business. Based on its business plan and reflecting continuing improvement in operational performance, the Group anticipates generating sufficient profits in future periods against which to utilise this asset. 2.7 CERTAIN REMEASUREMENTS AND EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS The Group reflects its underlying financial results in the Adjusted Results column of the Consolidated income statement. In order to provide a clear and consistent view of trading performance, certain remeasurements and exceptional items are presented in a separate column. The Group believes that this presentation provides useful information about the financial performance of the business and is consistent with the way executive management, the Board and the analysts assess the performance of the business. The Group has a framework for the determination of transactions as exceptional. Transactions presented as exceptional are approved by the Audit Committee. In these financial statements, the following transactions have been designated as exceptional items and presented separately: - Acquisition and restructuring costs associated with the acquisition and on-boarding of ScottishPower Generation Limited (2018) and Opus Energy Group Limited (2017) into the Group, along with costs associated with the restructuring of the Pellet Production and B2B Energ S ppl b sinesses ----- 2.7 CERTAIN REMEASUREMENTS AND EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS continued - Costs incurred as a result of restructuring the Group’s debt in 2018 and 2017, including facility break costs and the acceleration of the amortisation of deferred finance costs associated with the redeemed facilities. - Asset obsolescence charges relating to coal-specific assets written-off following the conversion of the fourth unit at Drax Power Station to run on biomass. Certain remeasurements comprise gains or losses on derivative contracts to the extent that those contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, or hedge accounting is not effective, and those gains or losses are either i) unrealised and relate to the delivery of commodity contracts in future periods, or ii) are realised in relation to the delivery of commodity contracts in the current period. The effect of excluding certain remeasurements from the Adjusted Results is to reflect commodity sales and purchases at contracted prices – i.e. at the all-in-hedged amount paid or received in respect of the delivery of the commodity in question, to better present the trading performance of the Group in Adjusted Results.

Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the Group’s earnings (profit after tax in accordance with IFRS) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares that were in issue during the year. Diluted EPS demonstrates the impact if all outstanding share options that are expected to vest on their future maturity dates (such as those to be issued under employee share schemes – see note 6.2) were exercised and treated as ordinary shares as at the balance sheet date.

The final dividend has not been included as a liability as at 31 December 2018. This would bring total dividends payable in respect of the 2018 financial year to £56.0 million. In future years, if there is a build-up of capital in excess of the Group’s investment needs, the Board will consider the most appropriate mechanism to return this to shareholders. 2.10 RETAINED PROFITS Retained profits are a component of equity reserves. The overall balance reflects the total profits the Group has generated over its lifetime, reduced by the amount of that profit distributed to shareholders. The table below sets out the movements in retained profits during the year.

The Parent Company financial statements, set out on pages 182 to 187 of this Annual report, disclose the Parent Company’s distributable reserves of £233.6 million. Sufficient reserves are available across the Group as a whole to make future distributions in accordance with the Group’s dividend policy for the foreseeable future. The majority of the Group’s distributable reserves are held in holding and operating subsidiaries. Management actively monitors the level of distributable reserves in each company in the Group, ensuring adequate reserves are available for upcoming dividend payments and that the Parent Company has access to these reserves. The immediate cash resources of the Group of £289.0 million are set out in note 4.2 and the recent history of cash generation within note 4.4. The majority of these cash resources are held centrally within the Group by Drax Corporate Limited for treasury management purposes and are available for funding the working capital and other requirements of the Group. The Group’s financing facilities (see note 4.3) place certain conditions on the amount of dividend payments to be made in any given year. The Group expects to be able to make dividend payments, in line with its policy, within these conditions for the foreseeable future. ----- ###### SECTION 3: OPERATING ASSETS AND WORKING CAPITAL This section gives further information on the operating assets we use to generate revenue and the short-term liquid assets and liabilities, managed during day-to-day operations, that comprise our working capital balances. 3.1 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT This note shows the cost, depreciation and net book value of the physical assets controlled by us that we use in our businesses to generate revenue. The cost of an asset is what we paid to purchase or construct the asset. Depreciation reflects the usage of the asset over time and is calculated by taking the cost of the asset, net of any residual value, to the income statement evenly over the useful economic life of the asset. An asset’s net book value is its cost less any depreciation (including impairment, if required) charged to date. Accounting policy Property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost. Cost comprises the purchase price (after deducting trade discounts and rebates), any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management and the estimate of the present value of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment in value. We construct many of our assets as part of long-term development projects. Assets that are in the course of construction are not depreciated until they are ready for us to use in the way intended. This category has been shown separately for the first time in 2018. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write down assets to their residual value evenly over their estimated useful economic lives (UEL) of the assets from the date of acquisition (where relevant, limited to the expected decommissioning date of the power station – currently expected to be 2039). The table below shows the range of useful lives at the date of acquisition and the average remaining useful life at the balance sheet date of the main categories of asset we own in years: Range of Average UEL UELs at remaining acquisition Freehold buildings 23 8–33 Plant and equipment Electricity generation assets: Drax Power Station common plant 13 2–33 Drax Power Station biomass-specific assets 17 2–26 Drax Power Station coal-specific assets 5 3–19 Pellet production plant 14 5–20 Other plant, machinery and equipment 5 1–33 Decommissioning asset 21 34 Plant spare parts 21 Up to 34 Freehold land held at cost is considered to have an unlimited useful life and is not depreciated. Electricity generation assets are grouped according to the fuel type of the plant. Certain assets at Drax Power Station are common to the whole plant and are shown separately. Pellet production plant includes the US-based assets of the Group’s Pellet Production segment. Within the plant and equipment categories shorter lives are attributed to components that are overhauled and upgraded as part of rolling outage cycles. The majority of assets within these categories have a remaining useful life in excess of 15 years. Plant spare parts are depreciated over the remaining useful life of the power station. Costs relating to major inspections, overhauls and upgrades to the power station are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, if the recognition criteria are met; namely, when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually, taking into account regulatory change and commercial and technological obsolescence, as well as normal wear and tear. Residual values are based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date. Any changes are applied prospectively. ----- Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 135 ----- ###### SECTION 3: OPERATING ASSETS AND WORKING CAPITAL continued 3.1 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT continued Significant estimation uncertainty Asset lives are reviewed annually at each balance sheet date. Following the Government’s announcement relating to the cessation of coal generation, the Group concluded that coal generation will cease during 2025, but that the two existing coal units will be retained for conversion to alternative fuels in the period to 2039. The useful lives of electricity generation plant currently fuelled by biomass are unaffected by this change. No changes to the useful economic lives of assets have been made as a result of the most recent review. At each balance sheet date the Group reviews its property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that these assets may be impaired.

Issues and transfers reflect changes in the categorisation of assets during the period e.g. when an asset under construction is complete, it is transferred to the relevant depreciable asset category, or the issue of spare parts for use in repair and maintenance projects. When spares are utilised in such projects, the cost of the part is transferred from the property, plant and equipment balance and recognised as an expense in the income statement within operating costs. 3.2 OTHER FIXED ASSET INVESTMENTS Other fixed asset investments include equity investments held by the Group. Accounting policy Other fixed asset investments are recognised at fair value, based on quoted market prices where available, at the date of transfer. The Group designates its investments as at fair value through other comprehensive income, as they are intended to be held and not traded, in accordance with IFRS 9. Where quoted market prices are not available and investments cannot be fair valued, they are held at cost and are reviewed for impairment annually.

This note sets out the value of these assets that we hold at the year end. Accounting policy ROCs are recognised as current assets in the period they are generated and are initially measured at fair value based on anticipated sales prices. The value of ROCs earned is recognised in the income statement as a reduction in fuel costs in that period. Where our B2B Energy Supply business incurs an obligation to deliver ROCs to Ofgem, that obligation is provided for in the period incurred. At each reporting date the Group reviews the carrying value of ROC assets held against updated anticipated sales prices. Where relevant, this takes account of agreed forward sale contracts and the likely utilisation of ROCs generated to settle our own ROC obligations. Any impairment is recognised in the period incurred. Significant estimation uncertainty The fair values and net realisable values of ROCs referred to above are calculated based on assumptions regarding future sales prices in the market, taking into account agreed forward sale contracts where appropriate. Historic experience indicates that the assumptions used in the valuation are reasonable; however, actual sales prices may differ from those assumed. ROC valuations also include an estimate of the future benefit that may be obtained from the ROC recycle fund at the end of the compliance period. The recycle fund provides a benefit where supplier buy-out charges (incurred by suppliers who do not procure sufficient ROCs to satisfy their obligations) are paid over to renewable generators on a pro-rata basis. The estimate is based on assumptions about likely levels of renewable generation and supply over the compliance period and is thus subject to some uncertainty. The Group utilises external sources of information in addition to its own forecasts in making these estimates. Past experience indicates that the values arrived at are reasonable but they remain subject to possible variation.

The Group has increased sales and purchases of ROCs in the year as a result of working capital arrangements as described in note 4.4. 3.4 INVENTORIES We hold stocks of fuels and other consumable items that we use in the process of generating electricity and raw materials used in the production of compressed wood pellets. This note shows the cost of coal, biomass, other fuels and plant consumables held at the end of the year, including items at Drax Power Station, our facilities in the US and those off-site locations. Accounting policy Our raw materials and fuel stocks are valued at the lower of the weighted average cost to purchase and net realisable value. The cost of fuel stocks includes all direct costs and overheads incurred in bringing the fuel to its present location and condition, including the purchase price, import duties and other taxes (including amounts levied on coal under the UK carbon price support mechanism) and transport/handling costs. The Group uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge the costs denominated in foreign currencies. Where these contracts are designated into hedge relationships in accordance with IFRS 9, the stock cost is recognised at the hedged value. In previous periods, the cost of fuel stock also included gains and losses arising from fair value changes on maturing derivative contracts that did not qualify for hedge accounting. This practice has been discontinued and all such gains and losses are now included in cost of sales when they arise. The prior year has not been restated for this change ----- 3.4 INVENTORIES continued Both coal and biomass stocks are weighed when entering, moving within or exiting our sites using technology regularly calibrated to industry standards. Fuel burn in the electricity generation process is calculated using a combination of weights and thermal efficiency calculations to provide closing stock volumes. Both calibrated weighers and efficiency calculations are subject to a range of tolerable error. All fuel inventories are subject to regular surveys to ensure these measurements are sufficiently accurate. Coal stocks are verified by an independent stock survey carried out by a suitably trained specialist and a provision is made where the survey indicates a lower level of stock than indicated by the methods described above. Despite being an independent process, the survey depends on estimates and assumptions and as a result actual values may differ. The characteristics of biomass require specialist handling and storage. On-site biomass at Drax Power Station is stored in sealed domes with a carefully controlled atmosphere for fire prevention purposes and thus cannot be surveyed using traditional methods. Biomass stock is surveyed using regularly calibrated state-of-the-art RADAR scanning technology. As at 31 December 2018 £m 2017 £m Coal 81.0 44.5 Biomass 114.7 205.2 Other fuels and consumables 26.8 22.4 222.5 272.1 Inventories of biomass include £0.6 million of fibre and other raw materials utilised in the production of compressed wood pellets (2017: £1.5 million) and £0.9 million of work in progress (2017: £0.1 million) in our Pellet Production business. Other fuels and consumables include £4.4 million of consumables acquired as part of the ScottishPower acquisition. The cost of inventories recognised as an expense in the year ended 31 December 2018 was £1,601.1 million (2017: £1,285.8 million). 3.5 TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES Trade receivables represent amounts owed to us by our customers for goods or services we have provided but not yet been paid for. Accrued income represents income earned in the period but not yet invoiced, largely in respect of power delivered that will be invoiced the following month. Accounting policy Trade and other receivables are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is measured at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit loss. The transition to IFRS 9 has not had a significant impact on the calculation of the provision. Years ended 31 December 2017 2018 Restated £m £m Amounts falling due within one year: Trade receivables 162.6 125.7 Accrued income 197.0 203.7 Contract assets 4.3 5.3 Prepayments and other receivables 104.9 82.8 468.8 417.5 Trade receivables and accrued income principally represent sales of energy to counterparties within both our Power Generation and B2B Energy Supply businesses. At 31 December 2018, the Group had amounts receivable from two (2017: five) significant counterparties representing 12% (2017: 20%) of total trade receivables and accrued income. Of total trade receivables and acrrued income at 31 December 2018 £266.6 million (2017: £255.7 million) relates to B2B Energy Supply sales. Contract assets have been separated from accrued income for the first time on application of IFRS 15. The 2017 figures have been updated on the same basis. Contract assets relate to amounts for goods or services provided under customer contracts, where the ----- 139 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 ----- ###### SECTION 3: OPERATING ASSETS AND WORKING CAPITAL continued 3.5 TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES continued The movement in the allowance for doubtful debts is laid out in the following table: Years ended 31 December 2018 £m 2017 £m At 1 January 28.2 4.0 Receivables written off (15.6) (14.2) Additional amounts provided against 33.6 18.7 Acquisition – 19.7 Amounts reversed as recovered                                                                    (0.8) – Changes in models/risks parameters                                                                 (1.4) – At 31 December 44.0 28.2 The Group does not consider there to be any requirement for further provisions in excess of the provision for doubtful debts of £44.0 million (2017: £28.2 million). This provision, which principally relates to B2B Energy Supply receivables, has been determined using a lifetime expected credit loss calculation. Assumptions made regarding the recoverability of balances have been determined with reference to past default experiences in line with our policies and future prospects reflecting our understanding of our customer base. Specific balances are provided against where default events have occurred. Balances are only written off if deemed irrecoverable after all credit control procedures have been exhausted or the customer is in administration. The expected credit loss rates have been reviewed and updated during 2018 in order to reflect current cash collection rates in the B2B Energy Supply business and expectations of future cash collection rates. The change in rates applied has not had a material impact on the total provision in the current period and is not expected to significantly impact future periods. However, it has resulted in more balances having a provision applied. As a result, the value of trade receivables that are past due but are completely unprovided against, in accordance with the assessment described above, has reduced to £1.2 million (2017: £32.2 million). Credit and counterparty risk are both discussed in further detail in note 7.1. In the B2B Energy Supply business amounts provided against trade and other receivables increased by £33.6 million in the year, with a net charge in the income statement of £31.4 million, following a deterioration in cash collection rates in the first half of the year. During the second half of the year, collection processes were reviewed and improved. We expect this improvement to be indicative of future collection rates. At the end of the year, provisions of £44.0 million were £15.8 million higher than the end of the prior year. The following table shows the risk profile of amounts due from customers based on the Group’s provision matrix at 31 December 2018. Trade receivables days past due Balances Up to More than More than More than not yet due 30 days 30 days 60 days 90 days Total Group Expected credit loss rate – % <1% 7% 19% 32% 59% 26% Estimated total gross carrying amount at default – £m 18.4 75.2 11.5 6.8 58.6 170.5 Lifetime expected credit losses – £m 0.1 5.2 2.2 2.2 34.3 44.0 The expected credit loss rate is a weighted average for the portfolio of trade receivables associated with the B2B Energy Supply business. The majority of balances not yet due are held in the Power Generation business where the risk of default is considered to be very low. The analysis above excludes receivables acquired in business combinations – see note 5.1. ----- 3.6 CONTRACT COSTS The Group incurs costs of obtaining contracts in the B2B Energy Supply businesses. Accounting policy Management expects that incremental broker fees paid to intermediaries as a result of obtaining electricity and gas contracts are recoverable. The Group has therefore capitalised them as contract costs and amortises them on a straight line basis over the contract period in line with the recognition of revenue. The balance is included within prepayments in note 3.5. This amount includes both current and non-current balances. Amounts capitalised on the Consolidated balance sheet were £39.0 million at 31 December 2018 (2017: £39.3 million). In 2018 the amount of amortisation was £37.2 (2017: £24.4) and there was no impairment loss recognised. 3.7 TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES Trade and other payables represent amounts we owe to our suppliers (for trade purchases and ongoing costs), tax authorities and other creditors that are due to be paid in the ordinary course of business. We make accruals for amounts that will fall due for payment in the future as a result of our activities in the current year (e.g. fuel we have received but for which we have not yet been invoiced). Accounting policy Trade and other payables are measured at amortised cost. As at 31 December 2017 2018 £m Restated £m Amounts falling due within one year: Trade payables 110.5 79.5 Fuel accruals 128.1 95.3 Energy supply accruals 309.8 291.9 Other accruals 183.0 136.6 Other payables 187.1 101.5 Contract liabilities 20.0 27.6 938.5 732.4 Energy supply accruals includes £235.5 million (2017: £225.0 million) in relation to the Group’s obligation to deliver ROCs arising from B2B Energy Supply activities. The remaining balance principally comprises third party grid charge accruals of £51.7 million (2017: £36.8 million) and Feed-in-Tariff accruals of £14.1 million (2017: 25.9 million). The Group recognises a liability in respect of its unsettled obligations to deliver emissions allowances under the EU Emission Trading Scheme (ETS). Accruals at 31 December 2018 include £nil (2017: £30.6 million) with respect to the Group’s estimated net liability to deliver CO2 emissions allowances. Allowances are purchased in the market and are recorded at cost. Other payables includes £87.0 million (2017: £Nil) due under payment facilities described in note 4.4. Contract liabilities primarily relate to the advance consideration received from customers for fixed price electricity and gas contracts, for which revenue is recognised based on the stage of completion of the multi-year contract. This has been shown separately for the first time in 2018 due to the implementation of IFRS 15. The prior year has been restated to the same format. The balance reduces as revenue is subsequently recognised in the following period, offset by further advance consideration received. ----- Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 141 ----- ###### SECTION 4: FINANCING AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE This section provides further information about the Group’s capital structure (equity and debt financing) and cash generated from operations during the year. 4.1 RECONCILIATION OF NET DEBT Net debt is calculated by taking our borrowings (note 4.3) and subtracting cash and cash equivalents (note 4.2). The table below reconciles net debt in terms of changes in these balances across the year. Years ended 31 December 2018 £m 2017 £m Net debt at 1 January (367.4) (93.5) Increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 65.6 (4.0) Decrease/(increase) in borrowings 4.2 (267.8) Effect of changes in foreign exchange rates (21.5) (2.1) Net debt at 31 December (319.1) (367.4) Borrowings includes listed bonds, bank debt, revolving credit facilities and finance leases, net of any deferred finance costs. A reconciliation of the increase in borrowings during the year is set out in the table on page 143. Borrowings at 31 December 2018 does not include the acquisition bridge facility that was drawn down after the balance sheet date on 2 January 2019, see note 4.3. During 2018, the Group entered into a cross-currency interest rate swap, fixing the sterling value of the principal repayments in respect of the Group’s US dollar denominated debt (see note 4.3). If US dollar balances are translated at the hedged rate, rather than the rate prevailing at the balance sheet date, net debt would be reduced by £22.0 million (2017: £nil). The corresponding value of the hedging instrument is recognised at its fair value as a derivative financial instrument, see note 7.2. 4.2 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents include cash held in current and other deposit accounts that is accessible on demand. It is our policy to invest available cash on hand in short-term, low-risk bank accounts or deposit accounts. As at 31 December 2018 £m 2017 £m Cash and cash equivalents 289.0 222.3 4.3 BORROWINGS Accounting policy The Group measures all debt instruments (whether financial assets or financial liabilities) initially at fair value, which equates to the principal value of the consideration paid or received. Subsequent to initial measurement, debt instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Transaction costs (any such costs incremental and directly attributable to the issue of the financial instrument) are included in the calculation of the effective interest rate and are amortised over the life of the instrument. Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. Where this is the case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs. Debt instruments denominated in foreign currencies are revalued using period end exchange rates, with exchange gains and losses arising recognised as a component of net interest charges in the period they arise. The Group hedges foreign currency risk in accordance with the policy set out in note 7.1. Where hedging instruments are used to fix cash flows associated with debt instruments, the debt instrument and the hedging instrument are measured and presented separately on the balance sheet. Post-balance sheet events On 16 October 2018, the Group entered into a £725 million acquisition bridge facility (the Facility) to finance the acquisition of ScottishPower Generation Limited (see note 5.1). The Group incurred £3.8 million of costs establishing the Facility during the year, which were deferred on the balance sheet at 31 December 2018. On 2 January 2019, the Group settled the initial consideration due in respect of the acquisition of £687 million, which was part-funded by £550 million drawn from the Facility. The balance of the consideration was funded from existing cash reserves. ----- 4.3 BORROWINGS continued Reconciliation of borrowings The tables below show the movement in borrowings during the current and previous year: As at 31 December 2018 Borrowings before deferred Deferred Net finance costs finance costs borrowings £m £m £m Borrowings at 1 January 605.2 (15.5) 589.7 Cash movements: 2025 $300 million USD loan notes drawn down 213.3 (3.8) 209.5 Repayment of floating rate loan notes on 1 May 2018 (200.0) – (200.0) Repayment of $25 million USD revolving facility                                        (19.1)        –      (19.1) Deferred costs in relation to acquisition bridge facility                                      –      (3.8)      (3.8) Non-cash movements: Indexation of linked loan 1.2 – 1.2 Amortisation of deferred finance costs (note 2.5) – 3.1 3.1 Repayment of floating rate loan notes on 1 May 2018 – 5.2 5.2 Impact of foreign exchange rates 22.6 – 22.6 Changes in finance lease liabilities (0.3) – (0.3) Borrowings at 31 December 622.9 (14.8) 608.1 On 26 April 2018, the Group issued USD $300 million loan notes listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. The notes have a fixed interest rate of 6.625% and mature in 2025. The proceeds of the issue were used to repay £200 million floating rate loan notes issued in 2017. Costs associated with the repayment of these loan notes have been classified as exceptional. The purpose of the new loan notes is to extend the maturity date of the Group’s senior debt and reduce exposure to interest rate volatility. The Group has taken out a cross-currency interest rate swap (see note 7.1) to hedge the sterling cash flows associated with the USD loan notes. In addition to fixing the sterling value of interest payments over a five year period, this instrument fixes the sterling repayment of principal at £213.3 million in 2023, the impact of which would reduce borrowings by £22.0 million.

The RCF matures in April 2021, with an option to extend by one year, and has a margin of 150 basis points over LIBOR. At 31 December 2018, the RCF had been utilised to draw down letters of credit with a total value of £31.8 million (2017: £35.7 million). The Group had two facilities available but undrawn at 31 December 2018: - £725 million acquisition bridge facility, subsequently part-drawn on 2 January 2019 (as described above); and - USD $25 million 30-day revolving facility. The Group has no other undrawn debt facilities, although it has access to certain non-recourse trade receivable finance facilities and payment facilities, as described in note 4.4, which are utilised to accelerate working capital cash inflows and defer cash outflows.

As these contracts were designated into hedge accounting relationships under IFRS 9, the benefit is being recognised in the income statement when the hedged transaction occurs. (2) The prior year has been restated due to the initial application of IFRS 9 (see note 8.3). The B2B Energy Supply business has access to a facility which enables it to accelerate cash flows associated with trade receivables on a non-recourse basis, which generated a net cash inflow of £24 million in the year ended 31 December 2018, reflected as a reduction in receivables in the table above (2017: inflow of £34 million). The facility terms were amended during the year, increasing the facility size to £150 million and bringing more of the receivables balance into its scope, further improving the Group’s overall liquidity and risk profile. Cash from ROCs is typically realised several months after the ROC is earned; however, through standard ROC sales and purchase arrangements we are able to accelerate cash flows over a proportion of these assets. The net impact of ROC purchases and sales on operating cash flows was a £10.5 million outflow (2017: £161.0 million inflow). We also have access to facilities enabling us to sell ROC trade receivables on a non-recourse basis. These facilities were unused at the period end (2017: £Nil). The Group entered into a number of payment facilities in 2018 to leverage scale and efficiencies in transaction processing, whilst providing a working capital benefit for the Group, for which £87.0 million was outstanding at 31 December 2018 (2017: £Nil). The amounts fall due between 4 and 60 days from the end of the year. The Group has sought to normalise payment across its supplier base resulting in certain suppliers extending payment terms and some reducing terms. Suppliers are able to access a supply chain finance facility provided by a bank, for which funds can be accelerated in advance of the normal payment terms. The facility does not affect our working capital, as payment terms remain unaltered with the Group. At 31 December 2018, amounts utilised were not material. ----- ###### SECTION 4: FINANCING AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE continued 4.5 EQUITY AND RESERVES Our ordinary share capital reflects the total number of shares in issue, which are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange. Accounting policy Ordinary shares are classified as equity as evidenced by their residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting its liabilities. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. As at 31 December 2018 £m 2017 £m Authorised: 865,238,823 ordinary shares of 11 [16]⁄29 pence each 100.0 100.0 Issued and fully paid: 2018: 407,193,168 ordinary shares of 11 [16]⁄29 pence each 47.0 47.0 47.0 47.0 The movement in allotted and fully paid share capital of the Company during the year was as follows: Years ended 31 December 2018 2017 (number) (number) At 1 January 407,034,429 406,700,321 Issued under employee share schemes 158,739 334,108 At 31 December 407,193,168 407,034,429 The Company has only one class of shares, which are ordinary shares of 11 [16]⁄29 pence each, carrying no right to fixed income. No shareholders have waived their rights to dividends. Shares issued under employee share schemes Throughout January to December 2018, a total of 158,739 shares were issued in satisfaction of options vesting in accordance with the rules of the Group’s Savings-Related Share Option Plan. Of the shares issued, 42,874 were issued to individuals who have left the Group where discretion was used to vest the shares. Share buy-back programme On 20 April 2018, the Group announced the commencement of a £50.0 million share buy-back programme. As at 31 December 2018, the Group had repurchased 13.0 million ordinary shares as part of the programme at a total cost, including transaction costs, of £47.1 million. These shares are held in a separate Treasury Share reserve awaiting reissue or cancellation and have no voting rights attached to them. Subsequent to the year end, on 21 January 2019, the buy-back programme concluded. In total, the Group purchased 13.8 million shares for total consideration of £50.4 million, including transaction costs. ----- 4.5 EQUITY AND RESERVES continued Share premium The share premium account reflects amounts received in respect of issued share capital that exceed the nominal value of the shares issued.

Exchange differences relating to the translation of the net assets of the Group’s US-based subsidiaries from their functional currency (US dollar) into sterling for presentation in these consolidated financial statements are recognised in the translation reserve. The share premium and the merger reserve arose on the financial restructuring of the Group which took place in 2005. Movements in the share premium reserve reflect amounts received on the issue of shares under employee share schemes. Movements in the hedge reserve and the cost of hedging reserve, which reflect the change in fair value of derivative financial instruments designated into hedge accounting relationships in accordance with IFRS 9, are set out in notes 7.4 and 7.5. ----- ###### SECTION 5: OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES This section provides information on the assets and liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheet that are not covered in other sections, including goodwill, other intangible assets and provisions. 5.1 ACQUISITIONS Accounting policy Acquisitions of businesses are recognised at the point the Group obtains control of the target (the acquisition date). The consideration transferred and the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are measured at their fair value on the acquisition date. The assets and liabilities are recognised in the Consolidated balance sheet and the revenues and profit or loss of the acquired business are recognised in the Consolidated income statement from the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement in the period the acquisition occurs as an exceptional item. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Acquisition of ScottishPower Generation Limited The Group announced the proposed acquisition of ScottishPower Generation Limited from Iberdrola on 16 October 2018. The acquisition was approved by shareholders on 21 December 2018 and subsequently completed at 23:59 on 31 December 2018. ScottishPower Generation Limited was renamed Drax Generation Enterprise Limited (DGE) on 9 January 2019. DGE owns and operates a portfolio of hydro, pumped storage and gas-fired power generation assets, including Cruachan Power Station, one of only four pumped storage assets in the UK, run-of-river hydro schemes in Lanark and Galloway, and gas-fired Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) power stations at Damhead Creek, Rye House and Shoreham in the south of England, and Blackburn Mill in the north. DGE also owns SMW Ltd, a company operating a biomass-from-waste facility on the outskirts of Glasgow. The new sites are complementary to the Group’s existing generation activities, diversifying the Drax portfolio and widening the Group’s UK footprint. The expanded portfolio of assets ensures the Group can support a power system with increasing intermittent renewable capacity by providing flexible generation and system support. The acquired assets are expected to make a positive contributions to both Adjusted EBITDA and cash flows from 2019, as set out in the shareholder Circular recommending the acquisition, on 5 December 2018, and in the profit forecast referenced on page 41 of this Annual report. The purchase consideration was £702 million, payable entirely in cash, subject to working capital adjustments customary for a transaction of this type. In addition, following the suspension of the UK Capacity Market on 15 November 2018, the Group announced it had agreed a risk-sharing mechanism with the vendor which will activate in the event the Group does not receive 100% of the contracted Capacity Market payments for the acquired assets in the period 1 January to 30 September 2019. If 100% of Capacity Market payments are not received in this period, a further payment will be made either by the Group or by the vendor, the value and beneficiary of which is contingent upon the 2019 gross profit achieved by the acquired assets. The value of any further payment for both parties is capped at £26 million. Full details are set out on the Group’s website. [(www.drax.com/cmrisk).](http://www.drax.com/cmrisk)) In the event Capacity Market payments remain suspended beyond 2019, the Group will be entitled to no further compensation. Reflecting the Group’s belief that the Capacity Market is likely to be reinstated during 2019, no value has been ascribed to the risk-sharing mechanism in determining the fair value of the consideration payable on the acquisition date. In the event the Capacity Market restarts and the Group receives payments relating to the period following the Capacity Market suspension but prior to the acquisition date (1 October to 31 December 2018), these payments will be passed directly to the vendor and accordingly no amounts are recorded in the provisional fair values shown below. The total consideration, after adjusting for estimated working capital values, was £687 million. The consideration remains provisional and is subject to a completion accounts process. The consideration was paid on 2 January 2019, funded by a combination of existing cash reserves (£137 million) and the partial drawing of a £725 million acquisition bridge facility (£550 million). The Group expects to conclude a refinancing of the bridge facility during 2019, as described in note 4.3. Acquisition-related costs, including stamp duty and advisers fees, amounted to £18.4 million and have been recognised in 2018. The Group incurred a further £2.6 million of costs in 2018 on activities to ensure operational readiness and initial integration activities at completion. The total costs of £21.0 million are reported as exceptional items and included in the acquisition and restructuring line in the income statement. ----- 5.1 ACQUISITIONS continued The provisional fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired are set out in the table below: £m Property, plant and equipment 690.0 Financial assets 40.7 Financial liabilities (41.0) Pension surplus 3.8 Provisions (13.5) Intangible assets 0.6 Deferred tax liability (68.5) Total identifiable net assets 612.1 Goodwill 74.8 Fair value of consideration payable 686.9 Due to the acquisition completing at 23:59 on 31 December, there were no amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of the acquisition, other than the transaction and integration costs described above. Provisional goodwill of £74.8 million is largely reflective of the trading and operational opportunities that arise from acquiring a multi-site multi-fuel generation portfolio together with the assembled skilled workforce. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Intangible assets reflect software previously recognised on the balance sheet of the acquiree. The financial assets acquired include £35.8 million of receivables, the majority of which reflect trade receivables for ancillary services and balancing market activity. By virtue of their short tenor, the fair value of these receivables is considered to be the contractual amounts receivable less any provision for doubtful debts. The provision for doubtful debts as at the acquisition date was less than £0.1 million. Financial assets includes a net balance of £3.5 million in respect of amounts payable to and receivable from the vendor and its fellow group undertakings. The Group received an initial settlement in respect of these balances on 2 January 2019, which will be finalised as part of the completion accounts process. Additional financial information The consolidated results of the Group, assuming DGE had been acquired at the beginning of the year, would show Total revenue of £4,780.0 million (compared to reported Total revenue of £4,229.0 million) and a Total profit after taxation of £43.2 million (compared to the reported Total profit after taxation of £20.2 million). This information includes the revenue and profits made by DGE and its subsidiary undertaking between 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2018, extracted from the historical financial records of the acquired companies. Profit centre analysis was used to exclude the historic results and restructuring activities relating to assets not acquired by the Group; however no adjustment has been made for the alignment of accounting policies nor the impact of measuring acquired assets and liabilities at fair value. This information is not necessarily indicative of the results of the combined Group that would have been achieved had the acquisition actually occurred on 1 January 2018, nor is it indicative of the future results of the combined Group. 5.2 GOODWILL Goodwill arises on the acquisition of a business when the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the assets acquired. Accounting policy Goodwill is initially recognised and measured at the acquisition date. Goodwill is not amortised but reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the CGU to which it relates and the recoverable amount for that CGU assessed. The table below shows movements and balances: Goodwill £m Cost and carrying amount: At 1 January 2017 14.5 Acquisition of Opus Energy 159.2 Disposal of Billington Bioenergy (3.8) At 31 December 2017 169.9 Acquisition of ScottishPower Generation Limited (see note 5.1) 74.8 At 31 December 2018 244.7 ----- Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 149 ----- ###### SECTION 5: OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES continued 5.2 GOODWILL continued In addition, the Group recognised £74.8 million of provisional goodwill in respect of the ScottishPower transaction in 2018 (see note 5.1). Reflecting the timing of the acquisition, none of the provisional goodwill has been allocated to individual CGUs. This will be completed during 2019. Impairment review The recoverable amount of the Haven Power and Opus Energy CGUs is measured annually, based on a value-in-use calculation using the Group’s established planning model. This model depends on a broad range of assumptions, the most significant of which are customer margins and supply volumes. Inherent in these assumptions are expectations about future energy prices and supply costs. Cash flows beyond the business plan period are inflated into perpetuity using a growth rate of 1%. The carrying amount of the Haven Power CGU at 31 December 2018 was £40 million. The expected future cash flows of the CGU were discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 8.1% (calculated based on independent analysis commissioned by the Group, adjusted to the specific circumstances and risk factors affecting the Group’s B2B Energy Supply business). We believe that this rate reflects the prospects for a well-established B2B Energy Supply business. The value in use of the Haven Power CGU, including the goodwill, was significantly in excess of its carrying amount. The carrying amount of the Opus Energy CGU at 31 December 2018 was £342 million, including intangible assets of £162 million. Following further integration of Opus Energy into the Group’s existing B2B Energy Supply business during 2018, the discount rate was assessed as being in line with that of Haven Power at 8.1%. The value in use of the Opus Energy CGU, including the goodwill and intangible assets, was significantly in excess of its carrying amount. Reflecting the recent acquisition of Opus, the recoverable amount of the Opus CGU was tested using a range of discount rates up to the rate used in the acquisition valuation of intangible assets in 2017 (10.7%) – application of discount rates across the 8.1% to 10.7% range would not result in an impairment charge. The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis of the estimates of future cash flows of each CGU. This analysis indicates that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions, which are customer margins and supply volumes, would not cause an impairment loss in respect of goodwill. 5.3 INTANGIBLE ASSETS Intangible assets are not physical in nature but are identifiable and separable from other assets. Intangible assets can be acquired in business combinations (such as the acquisition of Opus Energy during 2017) or purchased separately. The Group routinely purchases computer software and carbon emissions allowances, which are considered intangible assets. Accounting policy Intangibles acquired in business combinations are measured at fair value on the acquisition date. Other intangible assets are measured at cost. Cost comprises the purchase price (net of any discount or rebate) and any directly attributable costs to bring the asset into the condition and location required for use as intended by management. Intangible assets are amortised over their anticipated useful lives. Useful lives are reviewed at each balance sheet date. No changes to useful lives were made as at 31 December 2018. Amortisation calculations are specific to each category of assets and are explained in further detail below. Carrying amounts are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. The customer-related assets and brand are attributed to the Opus Energy CGU and details of the impairment test relating to this CGU are included in note 5.2. ----- 5.3 INTANGIBLE ASSETS continued Cost and carrying amount: Customer- Computer Development related assets Brand software assets Carbon Total £m £m £m £m £m £m At 1 January 2017 – – – 21.0 0.7 21.7 Transferred from Property, plant & equipment – – 39.4 – – 39.4 Utilised in period – – – – (0.7) (0.7) Additions at cost – – 16.0 – – 16.0 Acquisition 211.0 11.3 2.6 – – 224.9 At 31 December 2017 211.0 11.3 58.0 21.0 – 301.3 Additions at cost – – 28.9 – 3.7 32.6 Transferred from Property, plant & equipment – – 7.6 – – 7.6 Acquisition (note 5.1) – – 0.6 – 0.6 1.2 At 31 December 2018 211.0 11.3 95.1 21.0 4.3 342.7 Accumulated amortisation At 1 January 2017 – – – – – – Transferred from Property, plant & equipment – – 25.0 – – 25.0 Acquisition – – 0.7 – – 0.7 Charge for period 35.6 1.1 6.9 – – 43.6 At 1 January 2018 35.6 1.1 32.6 – – 69.3 At 31 December 2018 71.5 2.2 40.2 – – 113.9 Net book value At 31 December 2017 175.4 10.2 25.4 21.0 – 232.0 At 31 December 2018 139.5 9.1 54.9 21.0 4.3 228.8 Customer-related assets Customer-related assets reflect the value of customer contracts acquired on the acquisition of Opus Energy in February 2017, which provided the Group with access to a broad customer base with contracted cash flows. The asset valuation of £211 million reflected the estimated value of the future cash flows associated with this customer base at the acquisition date and is dependent upon estimates of both current and expected future contract margins and assumed customer retention rates. The cash flows have been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 10.7%. The asset has an estimated useful life of 11 years, calculated based on customer churn-rate analysis, and is being amortised on a reducing balance basis to reflect the diminishing rate of contract renewals over time. Opus Energy brand The Opus Energy brand was acquired as part of the acquisition in February 2017 and valued at £11 million on a relief-from-royalty method. The brand is being amortised on a straight-line basis over its assumed 10 year useful life. Computer software Additions in the period include assets acquired in the Opus Energy acquisition in addition to those in the ordinary course of business, which principally reflect ongoing investment in business systems to support the B2B Energy Supply segment. Software assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from three to five years. As at 31 December 2018, computer software assets in the course of construction amounted to £24.5 million (2017: £11.1 million). Development assets The development assets arose on the acquisition of four Open Cycle Gas Turbine projects in December 2016 and reflect the value of planning and consents. Until operations commence, the assets are considered to have an indefinite life and thus are not amortised and are subject to impairment testing at each balance sheet date. At 31 December 2018, the recoverable amount of the development assets was established using a value-in-use calculation derived from the Group’s established planning model. The assessment reflected the Group’s core planning assumption that the Capacity Market will be reinstated during 2019 and incorporated assumptions related to likely Capacity Market clearing prices, construction costs the ongoing revenues to be derived from the projects once constructed and the direct costs of generating those revenues ----- ###### SECTION 5: OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES continued 5.3 INTANGIBLE ASSETS continued The expected future cash flows were discounted using a pre-tax rate of 9.1%, which includes an assessment of the level of construction and execution risk inherent in the existing assets and quality of revenue if constructed. The analysis indicated a recoverable amount in excess of the current carrying amount of the development assets. The analysis is sensitive to the discount rate applied. Increasing the pre-tax discount rate by approximately 1% would result in a recoverable amount below the current carrying value. In the event costs materially increase, or expected future revenue streams reduce from current estimates, the Group may not proceed with the projects and the assets currently recognised on the balance sheet would be impaired. In particular, the analysis depends upon achieving an acceptable clearing price in future Capacity Market auctions (or equivalent income if the Capacity Market is not reinstated in its previous form). Carbon assets Carbon assets arise on the purchase of CO2 emissions allowances in excess of the amount allocated under the Emissions Trading Scheme and required for the current financial year, and are measured at cost, net of any impairment. Given their short tenor, carbon assets are not amortised. In the event of the UK exiting the EU without a deal, these allowances may no longer be required, as noted in the risks and viability statements on pages 42 to 49. The charge to the income statement, within fuel costs, reflects the cost of emissions allowances required to satisfy the obligation for the current year and takes into account generation and market purchases allocated to the current financial year, and to the extent further purchases are required, is based on the market price at the balance sheet date. 5.4 PROVISIONS We make provision for reinstatement to cover the estimated costs of decommissioning and demolishing our generation assets and remediating the sites at the end of the useful economic lives of the assets. Accounting policy Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Specifically, provision is made for the estimated decommissioning costs at the end of the useful economic life of the Group’s generating assets, when a legal or constructive obligation arises, on a discounted basis. The amount provided is calculated on a site-by-site basis and represents the present value of the expected costs. In view of the uncertainty of assessing the amount of any proceeds from the disposal of the assets at the decommissioning date, no reduction in the provision is made for any such proceeds. The discount rate used is a risk-free pre-tax rate that reflects the duration of the liability. The average discount rate used across the Group’s decommissioning provisions is 1.8% (2017: 1.8%). The use of a risk-free rate reflects the fact that the estimated future cash flows have built-in risks specific to the liability. An amount equivalent to the discounted provision is capitalised within property, plant and equipment and is depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets. The unwinding of the discount is included in interest payable and similar charges. Other provisions include a small provision in respect of dilapidation provisions for leased offices and other provisions recognised as part of the acquisition of ScottishPower Generation Limited (see note 5.1).

The decommissioning provision is based on the assumption that the decommissioning and reinstatement will take place at the end of the expected useful life of each site (which varies between 2026 and 2039) and has been estimated using existing technology at current prices based on independent third-party advice, updated on a triennial basis. The most recent updates took place in December 2017 for Drax Power Station, and 2018 for other sites. ----- ###### SECTION 6: OUR PEOPLE The notes in this section relate to the remuneration of our directors and employees, including our obligations under retirement benefit schemes. 6.1 EMPLOYEES AND DIRECTORS This note provides a more detailed breakdown of the cost of our employees, including executive directors. The average number of employees in Operations (staff based at production sites), B2B Energy Supply services (employees in our B2B Energy Supply segment) and Central and administrative functions are also provided. Further information in relation to pay and remuneration of the executive directors can be found in the report of the Remuneration Committee, starting on page 75. The Group acquired ScottishPower on the last day of the reporting period and as such no ScottishPower employee data has been included. The number of ScottishPower staff joining the Group as a result of the acquisition is 252.

We incur a non-cash charge in respect of these schemes in our income statement, which is set out below along with a detailed description of each scheme and the number of options outstanding. Accounting policy The PSP, BMP, DSP and SAYE share-based payments are equity settled. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at the fair value of the equity instrument at the date of grant and are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the relevant vesting period, based on an estimate of the shares that will ultimately vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions, which is revised at each balance sheet date. ----- Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 153 ----- ###### SECTION 6: OUR PEOPLE continued 6.2 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS continued Costs recognised in the income statement in relation to share-based payments during the year were as follows: Equity settled Years ended 31 December 2018 £m 2017 £m PSP (granted from 2017) 1.3 0.5 DSP (granted from 2017) 0.2 0.1 BMP (granted in periods prior to 2017) 0.7 1.5 SAYE 1.8 4.0 Total share-based payment expense (note 6.1) 4.0 6.1 Share Incentive Plan (SIP) Between 2008 and 2010, qualifying employees could buy up to £1,500 worth of Partnership Shares in any one tax year. Matching shares were awarded to employees to match any shares they bought, in a ratio of one-to-one, with the cost of matching shares borne by the Group. There have been no awards under the SIP Partnership and Matching Share plan since 2010. Shares in the Company held under trust and under the Company’s control as a result of the SIP were as follows: Shares Shares Nominal Market held at Shares Shares held at Cost at value at value at 1 January acquired transferred 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 2018 during year during year 2018 2018 2018 2018 (number) (number) (number) (number) £000 £000 £000 SIP 123,282 – (34,999) 88,283 – 10 317 Performance Share Plan (PSP) The PSP was introduced for directors and senior executives to replace the Bonus Matching Plan. Under the PSP, annual awards of performance and service-related shares are made for no consideration to executive directors and other senior executives up to a maximum of 175% of their annual bonus. Vesting of a proportion of shares is conditional upon whether the Group’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) matches or outperforms an index (determined in accordance with the scheme rules) over three years and vesting of a proportion of shares is conditional upon performance against the internal balanced corporate scorecard. 50% of the PSP options granted in 2018 will vest conditional on Group TSR relative to the TSR of a comparator group of companies, with the remaining 50% vesting conditional upon the internal balanced corporate scorecard. The fair value of the 2018 PSP awards of £2.5 million (2017: £2.8 million) is being charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the three-year vesting period. The fair value of PSP awards is calculated using a Monte-Carlo valuation model, which takes into account the estimated probability of different levels of vesting. The key inputs to the valuation model for the 2018 awards are the share price at the grant date of 272 pence (2017: 325 pence), expected volatility of 41% (2017: 44%), and risk-free interest rate of 0.83% (2017: 0.13%). Movements in the number of shares outstanding for the PSP awards are as follows: 2018 (number) 2017 (number) At 1 January 1,289,762 – Granted 1,560,757 1,582,309 Forfeited (175,183) (292,547) Exercised – – Expired – – At 31 December 2,675,336 1,289,762 The weighted average fair value of the options granted during the year was 160 pence (2017: 177 pence). All of the PSP options outstanding at the end of the period had an exercise price of £nil (2017: £nil). The weighted average remaining contractual life was 22 months (2017: 28 months). ----- 154 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 ----- 6.2 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS continued Deferred Share Plan (DSP) In addition, the Group operates the DSP, which was introduced as a vehicle for deferring 35% of the annual bonus of executive directors. DSP awards are granted at nil cost and vest after three years subject to continued employment or “good leaver” termination provisions. The share price on the grant date of DSP awards made in 2018 was 272 pence (2017: 325 pence) and the fair value of these awards of £0.4 million (2017: £0.6 million) is being charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the three-year vesting period. The fair value of DSP awards is calculated using a Monte-Carlo valuation model, which takes into account the estimated probability of different levels of vesting. The key inputs to the valuation model for the 2018 awards are the share price at date of grant, expected volatility of 41% (2017: 44%), and risk-free interest rate of 0.83% (2017: 0.13%). Movements in the number of share options outstanding for the DSP awards are as follows: 2018 (number) 2017 (number) At 1 January 110,809 – Granted 135,972 170,227 Forfeited – (59,418) Exercised (20,193) – Expired – – At 31 December 226,588 110,809 50% of the DSP options granted in 2018 will vest in three years conditional on Group TSR relative to the TSR of a comparator group of companies, with the remaining 50% vesting conditional upon the internal balanced corporate scorecard. Bonus Matching Plan (BMP) Under the BMP, annual awards of performance and service-related shares were made for no consideration to executive directors and other senior executives up to a maximum of 150% of their annual bonus up until 2016. The BMP was replaced in 2017 by the PSP. For awards prior to 2017, a proportion of the shares vesting under the BMP are conditional upon whether the Group’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) matches or outperforms an index (determined in accordance with the scheme rules) over three years and a proportion of the shares vesting is conditional upon performance against the internal balanced corporate scorecard. The fair value of the 2017 and 2016 BMP awards, £0.6 million and £2.6 million respectively, are being charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the corresponding three-year vesting periods. The fair value of BMP awards is calculated using a Monte-Carlo valuation model, which takes into account the estimated probability of different levels of vesting. No BMP awards were made in 2018. Movements in the number of share options outstanding for the BMP awards is as follows: 2018 BMP (number) 2017 BMP (number) 2016 BMP (number) At 1 January                                                                 2,314,155 3,193,932 3,411,792 Granted                                                                          –           – 1,686,095 Forfeited (26,436)    (196,402) (623,597) Exercised                                                                   (125,499)      (131,952) (337,146) Expired (987,090) (551,423) (943,212) At 31 December 1,175,130 2,314,155 3,193,932 For the BMP options exercised during the period, the weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 270 pence (2017: 308 pence).

Options were granted for employees to acquire shares at a price of 211 pence (2017: 280 pence), representing a discount of 20% to the prevailing market price determined in accordance with the scheme rules. The options are exercisable at the end of three or five-year savings contracts. The fair value of the options granted in connection with the SAYE plan of £1.2 million (2017: £0.9 million) is being charged to the income statement over the term of the relevant contracts. Movements in the number of share options outstanding for the SAYE plans are as follows: 2018 2017 SAYE five-year (number) 2017 SAYE three-year (number) SAYE three-year (number) SAYE five-year (number) At 1 January 3,622,469 1,007,289 3,286,906 996,709 Granted 1,078,583 328,325 752,414 140,974 Forfeited (79,515) (6,295) (81,269) (32,324) Exercised (157,804) (935) (34,525) (6,526) Expired (578,783) (220,990) (301,057) (91,544) At 31 December 3,884,950 1,107,394 3,622,469 1,007,289 The fair value of SAYE awards is calculated using a Black-Scholes model, which compares exercise price to share price at the date of grant. The fair value of SAYE options granted and the inputs to the option pricing model used in the current and previous year are set out in the table below: Grant date 28 March 2018 28 March 2018 27 March 2017  27 March 2017 Share price at grant date (pence) 275 275 328 328 Vesting period 3 years 5 years 3 years 5 years Exercise price (pence) 211 211 280 280 Dividend yield 5.1% 3.0% 1.8% 2.5% Annual risk-free interest rate 1.22% 1.35% 0.73% 0.90% Expected volatility 40.9% 38.1% 41.2% 37.3% Fair value of options granted (pence) 80 94 106 103 Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous three and five years respectively. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. For the SAYE options exercised during the period, the weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 365 pence (2017: 305 pence). The weighted average exercise price of SAYE options outstanding at the end of the period was 212 pence (2017: 224 pence). The weighted average remaining contractual life was 16 months (2017: 22 months). The number of options exercisable at the year-end was 2,252 (2017: nil). Additional information in relation to the Group’s share-based incentive plans is included in the Remuneration Committee report on page 75. ----- 6.3 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS The Group operates one defined benefit and four defined contribution pension schemes. The Drax Power Group (DPG) section of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme (ESPS) is a defined benefit scheme: a pension arrangement under which participating members receive a pension benefit at retirement determined by the scheme rules. Members are typically entitled to an annual pension on retirement of 1/80th of final pensionable salary for each year of service plus a tax-free lump sum of three times pension. The Drax Group Personal Pension Plan, Haven Power Personal Pension Plan, Opus Energy Group Personal Pension Plan and Drax Biomass Inc. 401(K) Plan are defined contribution schemes, which provide a retirement benefit that is dependent upon actual contributions made by the Group and members of the relevant scheme. As part of the acquisition of Drax Generation Enterprise Limited (see note 5.1), employees with defined benefit pension rights were transferred to the Group. These employees continue to participate in the Scottish Power Pension Scheme whilst the Group is in the process of setting up a new scheme (the Drax 2019 Scheme) for the members to transfer into. Accounting policy Payments to defined contribution schemes are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered services that entitle them to the contributions. The income statement charge for the defined contribution scheme represents the contributions due to be paid by the Group in respect of the current period. For the defined benefit pension scheme, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each reporting period. Remeasurement of the obligation, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on scheme assets (excluding interest), is recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit to the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which it occurs. Defined benefit costs, including current service costs, past service costs and gains and losses on curtailments and settlements are recognised in the income statement as part of operating and administrative expenses in the period in which they occur. The net interest expense is recognised in finance costs. Significant estimation uncertainty Measurement of the defined benefit obligation using the projected unit credit method involves the use of key assumptions, including discount rates, inflation rates, salary and pension increases and mortality rates. These actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually and modified as appropriate. The Group believes that the assumptions utilised in measuring obligations under the scheme are reasonable based on prior experience, market conditions and the advice of scheme actuaries. However, actual results may differ from such assumptions. The assumptions applied in 2018 have been prepared on a consistent basis with those in the previous period and in accordance with independent actuarial advice received. Defined contribution schemes The Group operates four defined contribution schemes, the Drax Group Personal Pension Plan, Haven Power Personal Pension Plan, Opus Energy Group Personal Pension Plan and Drax Biomass Inc. 401(K) Plan, for all qualifying employees. Pension costs for the defined contribution schemes are as follows: Years ended 31 December 2018 £m 2017 £m Total included in staff costs 8.1 8.1 As at 31 December 2018, contributions of £1.1 million (2017: £nil) due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. ----- Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 157 ----- ###### SECTION 6: OUR PEOPLE continued 6.3 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS continued Defined benefit schemes The breakdown of the defined benefit pension surplus is as follows: As at 31 December 2018 2017 £m £m Drax Power Group section of ESPS – net surplus/(liability) 18.9 (1.2) Drax 2019 Scheme – net surplus 3.8 – Total net surplus/(liability) recognised in the balance sheet 22.7 (1.2) During 2018, application of the accounting assumptions used in relation to the Drax Power Group of the ESPS, which are described in further detail below, resulted in the scheme moving into a position of surplus assets over liabilities. The scheme rules allow the Group to benefit from any residual surplus upon winding up of the scheme. As a result, the surplus has been recognised in the balance sheet in full. Drax Power Group (DPG) section of ESPS The DPG section of the ESPS was closed to new members as of 1 January 2002 unless they qualify through being existing members of another part of the ESPS. Members who joined before this date continue to build up pension benefits as part of the scheme. The DPG ESPS exposes the Group to actuarial and other risks, the most significant of which are considered to be: Investment risk The scheme liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. The scheme holds a significant proportion of growth assets (diversified growth funds, direct lending and absolute return bonds) which, though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, create volatility and risk in the short term. The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the scheme’s long-term objectives. Discount rate risk A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed upon the scheme’s liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the scheme’s bond holdings. Longevity risk The majority of the scheme’s obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities of the scheme. Inflation risk The majority of the scheme’s obligations to pay benefits are linked to inflation and, as such, higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities. The majority of the assets held by the scheme are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, such that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit. In most cases, caps on inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation. The scheme has a significant holding in liability-driven investments and a substantial proportion of this risk is hedged. Other risks include operational risks (such as paying out the wrong benefits), legislative risks (such as the Government increasing the burden on pension schemes through new legislation) and other demographic risks (such as making a higher proportion of members with dependants eligible to receive pensions from the Group). The Trustees ensure certain benefits payable on death before retirement. The most recent funding valuation of the DPG ESPS was carried out by Aon Hewitt, a qualified independent actuary, as at 31 March 2016. The actuarial review at 31 December 2018 is based on the same membership and other data as this funding valuation. The scheme board accepted the advice of the actuary and approved the use of these assumptions for the purpose of assessing the scheme cost. Future valuations are required by law at intervals of no more than three years. The results of the latest funding valuation at 31 March 2016 have been adjusted to the balance sheet date, taking into account experience over the period since 31 March 2016, changes in market conditions and differences in financial and demographic assumptions. The present value of the defined benefit obligation and the related current service costs were measured using the projected unit credit method. The principal assumptions used, which reflect the nature and term of the scheme liabilities, are as follows: As at 31 December 2018 % p.a. 2017 % p.a. Discount rate 3.0 2.6 Inflation (RPI) 3.2 3.2 Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.1 3.0 ----- 158 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 ----- 6.3 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS continued Mortality assumptions are based on recent actual mortality experience of scheme members and allow for expected future improvements in mortality rates. The assumptions are that a member aged 60 in 2018 will live, on average, for a further 26 years if they are male (2017: 26 years) and for a further 29 years if they are female (2017: 29 years). Life expectancy at age 60 for male and female non-pensioners currently aged 45 is assumed to be 27 and 30 years respectively (2017: 27 and 30 years respectively). The net surplus recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the DPG section of the ESPS is the excess of the fair value of the plan assets over the present value of the defined benefit obligation, determined as follows: As at 31 December 2018 2017 £m £m Defined benefit obligation (275.6) (306.5) Fair value of plan assets 294.5 305.3 Net surplus/(liability) recognised in the balance sheet 18.9 (1.2) The amounts recognised in the income statement, within other operating and administrative expenses and finance costs, are as follows: Years ended 31 December 2018 £m 2017 £m Included in staff costs (note 6.1): Current service cost 6.8 7.3 Past service cost 0.6 – Included in finance costs (note 2.5): Interest on net defined benefit (surplus)/liability (0.1) 0.5 Total amounts recognised in the income statement 7.3 7.8 On 26 October 2018, the High Court issued a judgement confirming that defined benefit schemes should be amended to equalise benefits in relation to guaranteed minimum pensions (GMP) for men and women. It is not yet agreed how benefits will be equalised in practice; however, on the grounds that implementation will not lead to any further obligations, the Group’s actuarial advisers have initially estimated that the liabilities of the scheme will increase by £0.6m as at the date of the court ruling. This has been reflected as a past service cost in 2018. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in full, as follows: Years ended 31 December 2018 2017 £m £m Cumulative actuarial losses on defined benefit pension scheme at 1 January (57.8) (79.2) Actuarial gains on defined benefit pension scheme recognised in the year 15.9 21.4 Cumulative actuarial losses recognised in the statement of comprehensive income at 31 December (41.9) (57.8) Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation are as follows: Years ended 31 December 2018 £m 2017 £m Defined benefit obligation at 1 January 306.5 311.4 Current service cost 6.8 7.3 Past service cost 0.6 – Employee contributions 0.1 0.1 Interest cost 7.8 8.5 Actuarial gains (23.0) (4.8) Benefits paid (23.2) (16.0) ----- Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 159 ----- ###### SECTION 6: OUR PEOPLE continued 6.3 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS continued The actuarial gains of £23.0 million (2017: £4.8 million) reflect gains of £21.8 million arising from changes in financial assumptions (2017: gains of £5.5 million) and £1.8 million gains arising from changes in demographic assumptions (2017: losses of £4.5 million) offset by losses arising from scheme experience of £0.6 million (2017: gains of £3.8 million). The gains due to changes in financial assumptions principally reflect the decrease in the present value of the scheme liabilities arising as a result of the change in discount rate assumption to 3.0% (2017: 2.6%) following increases in corporate bond yields. Changes in the fair value of plan assets are as follows: Years ended 31 December 2018 £m 2017 £m Fair value of plan assets at 1 January 305.3 281.3 Interest on plan assets 8.0 8.0 Remeasurement (losses)/gains (7.2) 16.6 Employer contributions 11.5 15.3 Employee contributions 0.1 0.1 Benefits paid (23.2) (16.0) Fair value of plan assets at 31 December 294.5 305.3 Employer contributions included payments totalling £5.0 million (2017: £7.5 million) to reduce the actuarial deficit. There were no contributions outstanding at the end of the year (2017: £0.8 million). The actual return on plan assets in the period was £0.8 million (2017: £24.5 million). The fair values of the major categories of plan assets were as follows: As at 31 December 2018 £m 2017 £m Gilts 83.6 104.1 Equities[(1][)] 9.8 76.6 Fixed interest bonds[(2)] 50.2 71.6 Property 34.8 32.2 Investment funds 40.4 – Cash and other assets[(3)] 75.7 20.8 Fair value of total plan assets 294.5 305.3 Notes: (1) At 31 December 2018 the scheme’s long-term asset strategy was: diversified growth funds (35%), direct lending (5%), absolute return bonds (7%), corporate bonds (8%), liability driven investing (29%), long lease property (12%), and cash (5%) (2) Fixed interest bonds include a mixture of corporate, Government and absolute return bonds. Approximately 10% of the bonds have a sub-investment grade credit rating (i.e. BB+ or lower) (3) Other assets include £15.5 million of investments in direct lending, a type of private equity vehicle, which is not quoted in an active market (2017: £17.9 million) The pension plan assets do not include any ordinary shares issued by Drax Group plc or any property occupied by the Group. The Group employs a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return on pension plan assets. Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles. The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return for each asset class relative to the actual asset allocation for the scheme. ----- 6.3 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS continued The assumptions for discount rate, inflation rate, rate of increase in pensions paid and expected return on plan assets all have a potentially significant effect on the measurement of the scheme surplus. The following table provides an indication of the sensitivity of the pension surplus at 31 December 2018 to changes in these assumptions: Increase/ (decrease) in net surplus % £m Discount rate – Increase 0.25 13.6 – Decrease 0.25 (15.2) Inflation rate[(1) ] – Increase 0.25 (13.1) – Decrease 0.25 12.3 Life expectancy – Increase 1 year (9.2) – Decrease 1 year 9.3 Note: (1)  The sensitivity of the scheme liabilities to salary and pension increases is closely correlated with inflation The Group is exposed to investment and other experience risks, as described above, and may need to make additional contributions where it is estimated that the benefits will not be met from regular contributions and expected investment income. The defined benefit obligation includes benefits for current employees of the Group (60%), former employees of the Group who are yet to retire (5%) and retired pensioners (35%). The weighted-average period over which benefit payments are expected to be made, or the duration of the scheme liabilities, was assessed at the 31 March 2016 funding valuation to be 21 years. Future contributions The Group expects to make regular contributions, in respect of service costs, of £10.1 million to the defined benefit pension plan during the 12 months ended 31 December 2019. In addition to regular contributions, deficit contributions have been agreed with the Trustees based upon the Technical Provisions as at the 31 March 2016 valuation. The Technical Provisions indicate a deficit of £45 million including an estimate of the impact of future service costs, which do not meet the definition of a liability at 31 December 2018 for inclusion in the financial statements. This valuation has improved since 31 March 2016, in line with the accounting surplus, although this remains subject to a recovery plan. The Group has agreed to make additional contributions over the period to 31 December 2025 to eliminate the deficit. At this point the scheme is expected to be self-sufficient, unless material adverse changes in economic conditions arise compared to those assumed in the valuation. The Group is confident that the additional contributions are manageable within the Group’s business plan. The terms of the Trust Deed allow the Group to recover any surplus once the liabilities of the scheme have been settled. Accordingly the deficit contributions will not give rise to an unrecognised surplus. Drax 2019 Defined Benefit Scheme On 31 December 2018, the Group purchased a generation business from ScottishPower (see note 5.1). Under the terms of the sale and purchase agreement (SPA), a number of employees with defined benefit rights transferred to the Group. The employees in question continue to participate in the Scottish Power Pension Scheme whilst the Group is in the process of setting up a new scheme for the members to transfer into (the Drax 2019 Scheme). The calculations set out below have been performed on the assumption that the transfer of members and assets into the Drax 2019 Scheme occurs during 2019, and will be in accordance with the terms set out in the SPA and the draft Trust Deed regarding the future operation of the new scheme. The liabilities and asset values at 31 December 2018 have been calculated based on advice from PwC, an independent qualified actuary. The liabilities have been calculated using full member by member data as at 16 October 2018, the date of the SPA. The valuation has been prepared at 31 December 2018 allowing for the accrual of benefits up to the year end date and based on the assumptions set out below. The valuation includes an allowance for the equalisation of GMP, calculated using an actuarial GMP benefit modelling tool. The total asset value at 31 December 2018 has been estimated based on a share of funds mechanism agreed with ScottishPower in the SPA. ----- ###### SECTION 6: OUR PEOPLE continued 6.3 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS continued Assumptions have been set using the best information currently available to the Group and based on the Group’s expectations of events during 2019 in order to set up the new pension scheme. In the event that experience in 2019 differs from these estimates, retrospective adjustments may be required to the extent material. The principal assumptions have been set with reference to the nature and term of the liabilities acquired and are as follows: As at 31 December 2018 % p.a. 2017 % p.a. Discount rate 3.1 – Inflation (RPI) 3.1 – Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.0 – Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.7 – The net surplus recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the Drax 2019 Scheme is the excess of the estimated fair value of the assets to be transferred over the present value of the defined benefit obligation acquired: As at 31 December 2018 2017 £m £m Defined benefit obligation (50.7) – Fair value of plan assets 54.5 – Net surplus recognised in the balance sheet 3.8 – The draft Trust Deed provides for any residual surplus on winding up of the scheme to be returned to the Group. The assumptions for discount rate, inflation rate, rate of increase in pensions paid and expected return on plan assets all have a potentially significant effect on the measurement of the scheme surplus. The following table provides an indication of the sensitivity of the surplus at 31 December 2018 to changes in these assumptions: Increase/ (decrease) in net surplus % £m Discount rate – Increase 0.1 1.2 – Decrease 0.1 (1.2) Inflation rate – Increase 0.1 (1.0) – Decrease 0.1 1.0 Life expectancy – Increase 1 year (1.5) – Decrease 1 year 1.5 ----- ###### SECTION 7: RISK MANAGEMENT This section provides disclosures around financial risk management, including the financial instruments we use to mitigate such risks. 7.1 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk and credit risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of commodity and financial markets and seeks to manage potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. Risk management is overseen by the risk management committees as explained in principal risks and uncertainties (page 44) which identify, evaluate and hedge financial risks in close coordination with the Group’s trading and treasury functions under policies approved by the Board of directors. Commodity price risk The Group is exposed to the effect of fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly the price of electricity, gas, the price of coal, sustainable wood fibre and pellets, other fuels and the price of CO2 emissions allowances. Price variations and market cycles have historically influenced the financial results of the Group and are expected to continue to do so. The Group has a policy of securing forward power sales, purchases of fuel and CO2 emissions allowances when profitable to do so and in line with specified limits under approved policies. All commitments to sell power under fixed price contracts are designated as cash flow hedges as they reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of electricity. The Group purchases sustainable biomass, coal and other fuels under either fixed or variable priced contracts with different maturities principally from a number of international sources. The Group considers all such contracts to be economic hedges. The Group applies the own use exemption or hedge accounting in accordance with IFRS 9 as set out in the accounting policies in notes 7.2 and 7.4. Where forward power curves are less liquid, the Group uses financially-settled gas sales as a proxy for power to mitigate the risk of power price fluctuations. The Group also purchases gas under fixed-price contracts to meet the demand of its B2B Energy Supply customers and, looking forward following the acquisition of Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) assets at the end of 2018, as a fuel for its gas-fired generation portfolio. The Group purchases CO2 emissions allowances under fixed price contracts with different maturity dates from a range of domestic and international sources. All commitments to purchase CO2 emissions allowances under fixed price contracts are designated as cash flow hedges as they reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of CO2 emissions allowances. Commodity price sensitivity The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to commodity prices for outstanding monetary items at the balance sheet date. The analysis is based on the Group’s commodity financial instruments held at each balance sheet date. If commodity prices had been 5% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, in the Group’s Total Results: - profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2018 would increase/decrease by £6.6 million (2017: loss after tax would increase/ decrease by £1.5 million). This is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure to oil derivatives; and - the hedge reserve would increase/decrease by £18.9 million (2017: increase/decrease by £5.6 million) mainly as a result of the changes in the fair value of financial coal and power derivatives. Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to the fluctuations in foreign currency rates resulting from committed and forecast transactions in foreign currencies, principally in relation to purchases of fuel for use in the Power Generation business. These purchases are typically denominated in US dollars, Canadian dollars or euros. In addition, in order to optimise the cost of funding, the Group has issued foreign currency denominated debt in US dollars (see note 4.3). The Group utilises derivative contracts to manage exchange risk on foreign currency debt. It is the Group’s policy to hedge material transactional exposures using a variety of derivatives to fix the sterling value of foreign currency cash flows, except where there is an economic hedge inherent in the transaction. The Group enters into derivative contracts, including forwards and options, to manage its anticipated foreign currency requirements over a rolling five-year period. The Group also has a limited exposure to translation risk in relation to its net investment in its US subsidiary, Drax Biomass Inc. ----- ###### SECTION 7: RISK MANAGEMENT continued 7.1 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued Foreign currency sensitivity If sterling exchange rates had been 5% stronger/weaker against other currencies and all other variables were held constant, in the Group’s Total Results: - profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2018 would increase/decrease by £112.3 million/£124.7 million (2017: loss after tax would decrease/increase by £351.1 million/£285.5 million). This is attributable to the Group’s exposure to foreign currency exchange contracts entered in relation to fuel purchase contracts; and - other equity reserves would decrease/increase by £160.6 million/£183.6 million (2017: decrease/increase by £111.1 million/£122.8 million) as a result of the changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts. Interest rate risk The Group has limited exposure to interest rate risk, principally in relation to cash and cash equivalents and floating rate debt instruments. At December 2018 the Group had no floating rate debt instruments drawn. The Group has taken out a fixed to fixed cross-currency interest rate swap to hedge the future cash flows associated with the USD $300 million 2025 fixed rate loan notes, effectively converting them to sterling fixed rate cash flows. The return generated on the Group’s cash balance, or on amounts drawn on the revolving credit facility, are also exposed to movements in short-term interest rates. The Group manages cash balances to protect against adverse changes in rates whilst retaining liquidity. Information about the Group’s instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk and their repayment schedules is provided in note 4.3. Interest rate sensitivity The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year. If interest rates had been 1% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit after tax and net assets for the year ended 31 December 2018 would decrease/increase by £1.0 million (2017: loss after tax would decrease/increase by £2.2 million) as a result of the changes in interest payable during the period. Liquidity risk The treasury function is responsible for liquidity, funding and settlement management under policies approved by the Board of directors. Liquidity needs are monitored using regular forecasting of operational cash flows and financing commitments. The Group maintains a mixture of cash and cash equivalents, committed facilities and uncommitted facilities in order to ensure sufficient funding for business requirements. In managing liquidity risk, the Group has the ability to accelerate the cash flows associated with certain working capital items (principally those related to ROC sales and B2B Energy Supply power sales). In each case this is undertaken on a non-recourse basis and accordingly the ROCs and other items are derecognised from the balance sheet at the point of sale. As discussed in the financial review on page 34, the Group also utilises standard purchasing facilities to extend the working capital cycle, whilst still paying suppliers on time. The impact on the Group’s cash flows is described in note 4.4. The following tables set out details of the expected contractual maturity of non-derivative financial liabilities. The tables include both interest and principal cash flows. To the extent that interest flows are floating rate, the undiscounted amount is derived from interest rate curves at the balance sheet date.

The weighted average interest rate payable at the balance sheet date on the Group’s borrowings was 4.56% (2017: 4.38%). The following tables set out details of the expected contractual maturity of derivative financial instruments which are marked to market, based on the undiscounted cash flows. Where the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to projected commodity prices, or foreign currency exchange rates, as illustrated by the yield or other forward curves existing at the reporting date.

If a large supplier were to fall into financial difficulty and/or fail to deliver against its contract with the Group, there would be additional costs associated with securing the lost goods or services from other suppliers. The Group enters into contracts for the sale of electricity to a number of counterparties. The failure of one or more of these counterparties to perform their contractual obligations may cause the Group financial distress or increase the risk profile of the Group. ----- ###### SECTION 7: RISK MANAGEMENT continued 7.1 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued Credit risk The Group’s gross exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the balance sheet date, as summarised below: As at 31 December 2018 £m 2017 £m Financial assets: Cash and cash equivalents 289.0 222.3 Trade and other receivables 413.3 409.3 Other fixed asset investments 2.4 1.3 Derivative financial instruments 510.6 366.2 1,215.3 999.1 Trade and other receivables are stated gross of the provision for doubtful debts of £44.0 million (2017: £28.2 million) and exclude non-financial receivables such as prepayments. Of the Group‘s three operating segments, two are exposed to different levels and concentrations of credit risk, largely reflecting the number, size and nature of their respective customers. The Pellet Production segment only trades intra-group. The highest risk is in the B2B Energy Supply segment, with a high number of customers of varying sizes operating in a variety of markets. In particular, Opus Energy carries lower concentrations but higher levels of credit risk owing to a customer base comprised largely of smaller retail and commercial entities. In the B2B Energy Supply segment, credit risk is managed by checking a company’s creditworthiness and financial strength both before commencing trade and during the business relationship. Credit risk is monitored and managed by business sector. In addition the B2B Energy Supply segment extended its trade credit insurance programme to increase its mitigation to credit risk. For the Power Generation segment, the risk arises from treasury, trading and energy procurement activities, as well as sale of byproducts from generation activities. Wholesale counterparty credit exposures are monitored by individual counterparty and by category of credit rating, and are subject to approved limits. The Group uses master netting agreements to reduce credit risk and net settles payments with counterparties where net settlement provisions exist. In addition, the Group employs a variety of other methods to mitigate credit risk: margining, various forms of parent company guarantee, deed of charge, cash collateral and letters of credit. The majority of the Generation business’s credit risk is with counterparties in related energy industries or with financial institutions. In addition, where deemed appropriate, the Group has historically purchased credit default swaps. The investment of surplus cash is undertaken with the objective of that there is sufficient liquidity at all times, so that funds are available to meet liabilities as they fall due, whilst securing a return from invested funds and preserving the capital value of those funds within Board-approved policies. These policies manage credit risk exposure by setting out minimum rating requirements, maximum investment with any one counterparty and the maturity profile. Capital management The Group manages its capital to ensure it is able to continue as a going concern and maintain its credit rating while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders’ equity (excluding the hedge and cost of hedging reserves), plus net debt. Net debt is comprised of borrowings disclosed in note 4.3 and cash and cash equivalents in note 4.2. As at 31 December 2017 2018 Restated £m £m Borrowings 608.1 589.7 Cash and cash equivalents (289.0) (222.3) Net debt 319.1 367.4 Total shareholders’ equity, excluding hedge and cost of hedging reserves 1,580.0 1,634.7 ----- 166 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 ----- 7.2 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS We enter into forward contracts for the purchase and sale of physical commodities (principally power, gas, coal, sustainable biomass and CO2 emissions allowances) to secure market level bark and dark green spreads on future electricity sales, and also financial forward and option contracts (principally currency exchange contracts and financial coal and oil derivatives) to fix sterling cash flows. We hold these contracts to manage key risks facing the business, including commodity price risk and foreign currency risk (see note 7.1). A successful commercial hedging strategy is critical to the Group’s business model. Our policy is to fix exposures to commodity price movements and changes in foreign exchange rates using derivative contracts such as those described above. This strategy aims to de-risk the business, providing security and certainty over cash flows into the future. As at 31 December 2018, the fair value of our forward derivative contracts, consisting largely of forward contracts for the purchase of foreign currencies (principally for the purpose of fixing the sterling cost of sustainable biomass purchases), increased to £359.0 million (2017: £160.0 million). Accounting policy At the balance sheet date all contracts (subject to certain exemptions described below) must be measured at fair value, which is in essence the difference between the price we have secured in the contract, and the price we could achieve in the market at that point in time. Changes in fair value are recognised either within the income statement or the hedge reserve, dependent upon whether the contract in question qualifies as an effective hedge under IFRS (see note 7.4). Where possible, the Group has taken advantage of the own-use exemption which allows qualifying contracts to be excluded from fair value mark-to-market accounting. This applies to certain contracts for physical commodities entered into and held for the Group’s own purchase, sale or usage requirements, including forward contracts for the purchase of biomass, and coal from domestic sources. Contracts which do not qualify for the own-use exemption – principally power, gas, financial oil, financial coal, CO2 emissions allowances and forward foreign currency exchange contracts – are accounted for as derivatives in accordance with IFRS 9 and are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in fair value reflected through the hedge reserve (note 7.4) to the extent that the contracts are designated as effective hedges in accordance with IFRS 9, or the income statement where the hedge accounting requirements are not met. The Group enters into forward contracts solely for the purpose of financial risk management and considers all of its contracts to be economic hedges, regardless of whether the specific criteria for hedge accounting are met. To ensure these derivatives are not reflected in the underlying performance of the Group, they are excluded from the Adjusted Results in the income statement. Derivative financial instruments with a maturity date within 12 months from the balance sheet date are classified as current assets or liabilities. Instruments with a maturity date beyond 12 months are classified as non-current assets or liabilities. The location in the consolidated financial statements of the changes in fair value of derivative contracts in the current and previous year is summarised in the table below: Accounting treatment for gains/(losses) in the consolidated financial statements Accounting for derivative contracts Commodity contracts Gains/(losses) on contracts in 2018 £m Gains/(losses) on contracts in 2017 Restated £m Power 16.3 3.8 Hedge reserve Coal from international sources (0.4) (0.8) Income statement Coal from domestic sources n/a n/a Own-use exemption Biomass n/a n/a Own-use exemption CO2 emissions allowances 6.9 11.0 Hedge reserve Gas (10.0) 0.1 Income statement Financial contracts Foreign currency exchange contracts 35.0 (255.4) Income statement 39.3 20.8 Cost of hedging 79.7 (225.6) Hedge reserve Financial coal 1.5 12.9 Income statement (16.5) 1.5 Hedge reserve Financial oil and other financial products 12.3 66.3 Income statement Cross currency interest rate swap 5.1 – Hedge reserve Total net gains/(losses) in hedge reserve 91.5 (209.3) Total net gain in cost of hedging 39.3 20.8 ----- Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 167 ----- ###### SECTION 7: RISK MANAGEMENT continued 7.2 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Significant estimation uncertainty The fair values of derivative instruments for commodities and foreign currency exchange contracts are determined using forward price curves. Forward price curves represent the Group’s estimates of the prices at which a buyer or seller could contract today for delivery or settlement of a commodity or foreign exchange payment or receipt, at future dates. The Group generally bases forward price curves upon readily obtainable market price quotations, as the Group’s commodity and forward foreign exchange contracts do not generally extend beyond the actively traded portion of these curves. However, the forward price curves used are only an estimate of how future prices will move and are, therefore, subjective. Where derivative financial instruments include options these are valued using an option pricing model. Inputs to the model include market commodity prices, forward price curves, the term of the option, discount rate and assumptions about volatility based on historical movements. The inputs include assumptions around future transactions and market movements, as well as credit risk and are, therefore, subjective. Fair value accounting Forward contracts for the sale of power, purchase of coal from international sources, purchase of CO2 emissions allowances, financial coal, financial oil, gas (collectively “Commodity contracts”) and foreign currency exchange contracts are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value as follows: As at 31 December 2018 As at 31 December 2017 Assets £m Assets £m Liabilities £m Liabilities £m Commodity contracts: Less than one year 66.8 (72.7) 60.5 (79.3) More than one year but not more than two years 24.2 (30.5) 8.4 (14.4) More than two years 2.5 (2.5) 0.5 (1.1) Financial contracts: Less than one year 148.6 (16.7) 115.0 (30.3) More than one year but not more than two years 138.6 (9.2) 85.5 (20.0) More than two years 101.9 (19.8) 96.3 (58.7) Cross currency interest rate swap 27.9 – – – Total 510.6 (151.4) 366.2 (203.8) Less: non-current portion Commodity contracts (26.8) 33.0 (8.9) 15.5 Financial contracts (240.5) 29.0 (181.8) 78.7 Cross currency interest rate swap (27.9) – – – Total non-current portion (295.2) 62.0 (190.7) 94.2 Current portion 215.4 (89.4) 175.5 (109.6) The total increase in the fair value of these contracts of £196.8 million (2017: £365.4 million reduction) is recognised in the income statement, cost of hedging or the hedge reserve, dependent upon whether the hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9 are met, as follows: Years ended 31 December 2018 £m 2017 £m Total net gains/(losses) income statement (note 7.2) 38.4 (176.9) Total net gain in cost of hedging reserve (note 7.5) 39.3 20.8 Total net gains/(losses) in hedge reserve (note 7.4) 91.5 (209.3) Other movements on derivative contracts recognised in arriving at total operating profit (note 7.4) 27.6 – Total gains/(losses) on derivative contracts 196.8 (365.4) The Group maintains a substantial foreign currency hedging programme to secure the sterling cost of future purchases of fuel in foreign currencies. The vast majority of fuel purchases, and therefore currency exchange contracts, are denominated in US dollars. The unrealised gains reflect the weakening of sterling against the US dollar in the year. A material proportion of these contracts are not designated in hedge accounting relationships under IFRS 9 and thus the gains on these contracts were recognised in the income statement. Unrealised gains or losses recognised in the hedge reserve principally reflect gains or losses on the portion of forward currency ----- 7.2 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Fair value measurement - Commodity contracts fair value – The fair value of open commodity contracts that do not qualify for the own-use exemption is calculated by reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date. As contracts are generally short-term, forward market price curves are available for the duration of the contracts. The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price; the quoted price for financial liabilities is the current ask price. - Forward foreign currency exchange contracts fair value – The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts is determined using forward currency exchange market rates at the balance sheet date. - Other financial contracts fair value – The fair value of other financial contracts that do not qualify for the own-use exemption, is calculated by reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date. As contracts are generally short-term, forward market price curves are available for the duration of the contracts. The fair values of all derivative financial instruments are discounted to reflect the credit risk inherent within the instrument. The Group has reviewed all significant contracts for the presence of embedded derivatives. Where contracts were found to contain embedded derivatives, they were considered to be closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, and therefore do not require separate valuation from their host contracts. IFRS requires categorisation of our financial instruments in accordance with the following hierarchy in order to explain the basis on which their fair values have been determined: - Level 1 – fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; - Level 2 – fair value measurements are those derived from inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and - Level 3 – fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Categorisation within this fair value measurement hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset or liability. The fair value of commodity contracts and forward foreign currency exchange contracts are largely determined by comparison between forward market prices and the contract price; therefore, these contracts are categorised as Level 2. There have been no transfers during the year between Level 1, 2 or 3 category inputs. 7.3 OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Group hold a variety of other non-derivative financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, payables and receivables arising from operations. Fair value Cash and cash equivalents (note 4.2), trade and other receivables (note 3.5) and trade and other payables (note 3.7) generally have a short time to maturity. For this reason their carrying values, on the historical cost basis, approximate to their fair value. The Group’s borrowings relate principally to the publicly traded high-yield loan notes and amounts drawn against term loans, see note 4.3. The financial liabilities have been measured at amortised cost. The terms of the instruments have been reviewed for the existence of embedded derivatives. The 2022 fixed rate loan notes and the 2025 USD loan notes both contain an early repayment option that meets the definition of an embedded derivative. However, in both cases, these have not been separated as they are deemed to be closely related to the host contract. At 31 December 2018, the fair value of the loan notes was £4.6 million and in excess of the carrying value of £574.3 million (based on quoted market prices). ----- ###### SECTION 7: RISK MANAGEMENT continued 7.4 HEDGE RESERVE The Group designates certain hedging instruments used to address commodity price risk and foreign exchange risk as cash flow hedges. At the inception of the hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item is documented, along with its risk management objectives. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instruments used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items. Changes in fair value of contracts designated into such hedging relationships are recognised within the hedge reserve to the extent they are effective. The cumulative gains and losses unwind and are released as the related contracts mature and we take delivery of the associated commodity or currency. Hedge reserve 2017 2018 Restated £m £m At 1 January 126.1 305.4 Gains/(losses) recognised: – Commodity contracts 8.4 1.5 – Financial contracts 149.8 (161.9) – Cross currency interest rate swap 27.9 – Released from equity: – Commodity contracts (1.9) 14.8 – Financial contracts (69.9) (73.6) – Cross currency interest rate swap (22.8) – Related deferred tax, net (note 2.6) (17.7) 39.9 At 31 December 199.9 126.1 Commodity contracts and financial contracts are released from equity to revenue or cost of sales in the income statement. Gains and losses on the cross currency interest rate swap are released to interest costs. The Group’s cash flow hedges relate to commodity contracts (principally commitments to sell power) and forward foreign currency exchange contracts. Amounts are recognised in the hedge reserve as the designated contracts are marked-to-market at each period end for the effective portion of the hedge, which is generally 100% of the relevant contract. Amounts held within the hedge reserve are then released as the related contract matures and the hedged transaction impacts profit or loss. For power sales contracts, this is when the underlying power is delivered. For currency contracts, this is when the associated foreign currency transaction is recognised. Further information about the Group’s accounting for financial instruments is included in note 7.2. Included in amounts released from equity are gains and losses on financial instruments that matured in a previous period, released to the income statement in the period the hedged transaction occurs. No ineffectiveness was recognised in the income statement in the year (2017: £Nil). Due to the nature of the hedge relationships, the movement in value for the hedged items and hedging instruments are comparable. The expected release profile from equity of post-tax hedging gains and losses is as follows: As at 31 December 2018 >2 years £m Total £m Within 1 year £m 1–2 years £m Commodity contracts 2.7 3.6 0.5 6.8 Financial contracts 67.0 91.2 56.7 214.9 Cross currency interest rate swap – – (21.8) (21.8) 69.7 94.8 35.4 199.9 As at 31 December 2017 Within 1 year £m 1–2 years £m >2 years £m Total £m Commodity contracts 2.3 (1.7) – 0.6 Financial contracts 40.0 39.9 45.6 125.5 ----- 7.5 COST OF HEDGING RESERVE On transition to IFRS 9, the Group has elected to allocate unrealised gains and losses on the forward rate of foreign currency derivative contracts to a new cost of hedging reserve. The prior year amounts have been restated and a reconciliation is provided in note 8.3. A large proportion of the derivative contracts relate to foreign exchange contracts, including forward contracts, options and swaps. Consistent with prior periods, the Group has continued to designate the change in fair value of the spot rate in the Group’s cash flow hedge relationships. As part of the transition to IFRS 9, an election was made to designate the cost of hedging – being the change in fair value associated with forward points including currency basis – to equity. This change in policy has been applied retrospectively. As a result, the Group’s loss on initial application has decreased and the corresponding increase was taken through equity to a new cost of hedging reserve. The cumulative gains and losses unwind and are released as the related contracts mature and we take delivery of the associated currency. Cost of hedging 2017 2018 Restated £m £m At 1 January (40.7) (57.5) Gains/(losses) recognised: – Forward foreign currency exchange contracts 24.8 19.8 Released from equity: – Forward foreign currency exchange contracts 14.5 1.0 Related deferred tax, net (note 2.6) (7.5) (4.0) At 31 December (8.9) (40.7) Forward foreign currency exchange contracts are released to cost of sales in the income statement. The expected release profile from equity of post-tax cost of hedging gains and losses is as follows: As at 31 December 2018 Within 1 year £m 1–2 years £m >2 years £m Total £m Financial contracts 3.0 11.9 (6.0) 8.9 7.6 CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Contingent liabilities are potential future outflows of cash that are dependent on a future event that is outside of the control of the Group. The amount or timing of any payment is uncertain and cannot be measured reliably. Capacity market suspension On 15 November 2018 the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union found in favour of a claim against the European Commission, annulling the Commission’s State aid approval of the UK Capacity Market. This ruling imposed a standstill period on the Capacity Market, with payments under existing contracts and future capacity auctions suspended indefinitely until re-approval. Following this ruling, the Group ceased to accrue capacity market income in Power Generation. Any revenue up to 30 September was received, but from this date no amounts have been recognised. The Department for Business, Energy, Innovation and Skills (BEIS) has indicated its intent, in a consultation document dated 19 December 2018, to work with the European Commission to achieve a reinstatement of the Capacity Market as soon as possible. Furthermore, BEIS has indicated that, upon reinstatement, it expects to make back payments to Generators who have complied with their capacity agreements during the standstill period. At the date of signing these accounts the Group has complied with its capacity obligations in full. However, reinstatement remains conditional upon EU State aid re-approval and accordingly at the date of these accounts remains uncertain. If the capacity market is reinstated and payments are backdated, the Group will receive income of £7 million in respect of payments due to the Power Generation business which would become payable in respect of the year ended 31 December 2018. As disclosed in note 51 should 100% of the contracted Capacity Market payments for the Acquired Generation Business not be ----- F-190 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 171 ----- ###### SECTION 7: RISK MANAGEMENT continued 7.6 CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES continued Guarantees In addition to the amount drawn down against the bank loans, certain members of the Group guarantee the obligations of a number of banks in respect of letters of credit issued by those banks to counterparties of the Group. As at 31 December 2018, the Group’s contingent liability in respect of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility amounted to £31.8 million (2017: £35.7 million). The Group also guarantees obligations in the form of surety bonds with a number of insurers amounting to £63.7 million (2017: £41.3 million). Guaranteed Minimum Pension The Group has previously disclosed a contingent liability in respect of the equalisation of Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP). On 26 October 2018, the High Court issued a judgement confirming that schemes should be amended to equalise benefits in relation to GMP for men and women. Accordingly, the Group has included the estimated cost of equalisation (£0.6m) in calculating its defined benefit pension obligations at 31 December 2018 (see note 6.3). 7.7 COMMITMENTS The Group has a number of financial commitments (i.e. a contractual requirement to make a cash payment in the future) that are not recorded in the balance sheet as the contract is not yet due for delivery. Such commitments include contracts for the future purchase of coal and biomass, operating leases for land and buildings, contracts for the construction of assets and contracts for the provision of services. As at 31 December 2018 £m 2017 £m Contracts placed for future capital expenditure not provided in the financial statements 74.9 11.6 Future support contracts not provided in the financial statements 6.5 6.5 Future commitments to purchase ROCs 159.7 168.0 Future commitments to purchase fuel under fixed and variable priced contracts 6,716.6 5,803.5 The contractual maturities of the future commitments to purchase fuel are as follows: As at 31 December 2018 £m 2017 £m Within one year 1,084.2 1,054.2 Within two to five years 4,191.0 2,885.5 After five years 1,441.4 1,863.8 6,716.6 5,803.5 Commitments to purchase fuel reflect long-term forward purchase contracts with a variety of international suppliers, primarily for the delivery of sustainable wood pellets for use in electricity production at Drax Power Station over the period from 2019–2027. To the extent these contracts relate to the purchase of wood pellets, they are not reflected elsewhere in the financial statements owing to application of the “own-use” exemption from fair value accounting to such contracts (see note 7.2). The future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: As at 31 December 2018 £m 2017 £m Within one year 6.1 8.9 Within one to five years 12.7 25.5 After five years 12.0 9.1 30.8 43.5 The operating lease commitments principally comprise a number of leases for the Group’s office space. ----- ###### SECTION 8: REFERENCE INFORMATION This section details reference information relevant to the accounts. Here we describe the general information about the Group (e.g. operations and registered office). We also set out the basis of preparation of the accounts and general accounting policies that are not specific to any one note. 8.1 GENERAL INFORMATION Drax Group plc (the Company) is incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act. The Company and its subsidiaries (together, the Group) have three principal activities: - electricity generation; - electricity supply to business customers; and - manufacturing of sustainable compressed wood pellets for use in electricity production. The Group’s activities are principally based within the UK, with the wood pellet manufacturing activities situated in the US. The address of the Company’s registered office and principal establishment is Drax Power Station, Selby, North Yorkshire, YO8 8PH, United Kingdom. A full list of operating companies of the Group is disclosed in note 5 to the Company’s separate financial statements, which follow these consolidated financial statements. 8.2 BASIS OF PREPARATION Adoption of new and revised accounting standards A number of new and amended standards became effective for the first time in 2018. The Group adopted the following from 1 January 2018: IFRS 2 – Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions – effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. IFRS 15 (including clarifications issued on 12 April 2016) – Revenue from Contracts with Customers – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. IFRIC 22 – Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Other than the adoption of IFRS 9, these updates and amendments have not had a material impact on the financial statements of the Group. The transition disclosures for IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 have been included in note 8.3. At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following new or amended standards and relevant interpretations, which have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective (and some of which were pending endorsement by the EU – marked by *): IAS 40 (amended) – Investment Property – effective for annual reportings beginning on or after 1 July 2018. IFRIC 23 – Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments – effective for annual reports beginning on or after 1 January 2019. IFRS 16 (amended) – Leases – effective for annual reports beginning on or after 1 January 2019. IFRS 10 (amended) – Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 (amended) – Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (2011) – effective date deferred indefinitely. IAS 28 (amended) – Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures – effective from 1 January 2019. IAS 19 (amended) – Employee Benefits – effective from 1 January 2019. IFRS 3 (amended) – Business Combinations – effective from 1 January 2020. Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (amended) – effective from 1 January 2020. IAS 1 (amended) – Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 8 (amended) Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors – effective from 1 January 2020. ----- ###### SECTION 8: REFERENCE INFORMATION continued 8.2 BASIS OF PREPARATION continued Adoption of the other standards in future periods is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group, other than IFRS 16 as noted below. IFRS 16 – Leases The Group will adopt IFRS 16 from 1 January 2019 and has chosen to adopt the modified retrospective application. Consequently, comparative information in the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2018 will not be restated. The new requirements will impact the Group’s accounting for lease contracts. The Group’s current operating lease portfolio predominantly relates to properties and the hire of plant and equipment at operating sites. On transition to IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019, these leases will be brought onto the balance sheet as right-of-use assets, and the Group will recognise a corresponding liability for the amounts payable under the lease contracts. On transition, the Group will make use of the practical expedient available not to reassess whether a contract is or contains a lease. Accordingly, the definition of a lease in accordance with IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 will continue to apply to those leases entered into or modified before 1 January 2019. However, the Group will apply the new definition of a lease to all contracts entered into or modified on or after 1 January 2019. We do not anticipate this change to have a significant impact on the assessment of contracts that are in scope of the definition of a lease. For short-term leases (12 months or less) and leases of low value assets, the Group will elect to recognise a lease expense on a straightline basis as permitted by IFRS 16. Short-term leases include those which end within 12 months of transition. Under IFRS 16, right-of-use assets will be tested for impairment in accordance with our policy outlined in note 2.4. This will replace the previous requirement to recognise a provision for onerous lease contracts. Impact on lease accounting As at the reporting date, the Group has non-cancellable operating lease commitments of approximately £31 million. A preliminary assessment has been concluded that indicates the Group will recognise a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability of approximately £20 million on transition to the new standard in 2019. This value is lower than the value of non-cancellable minimum lease payments owing to the existence of short-term and low-value leases, and the effect of discounting. The preliminary assessment indicates that £18 million of the existing lease obligations relate to short-term and leases of low value assets. The effect of discounting has been estimated for the purpose of this analysis. The anticipated effect on profit or loss (compared to 2018 results for lease contracts in existence at the balance sheet date) is a reduction in administrative and operating expenses of approximately £5 million, offset by increases in depreciation of approximately £4 million and finance costs of approximately £1 million. Actual values may differ from those in this preliminary assessment. Due to the timing of the transaction the Group has not yet completed any detailed analysis of lease contracts acquired as part of the ScottishPower generation portfolio for this purpose. Initial investigations indicate the largest lease in the portfolio has a present value of approximately £5 million. ----- 8.3 ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND CHANGE IN PRESENTATION OF INCOME STATEMENT IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 supersedes IAS 11 Construction Contracts, IAS 18 Revenue and related interpretations. It applies to all revenue arising from contracts with customers, unless those contracts are in the scope of other standards. Adoption of IFRS 15 has not resulted in any changes to the amounts recognised in these financial statements compared to the previous requirements, nor any restatement of the prior period comparative information. The adoption of IFRS 15 has not resulted in any changes to the amount or timing of revenue recognised in either period. In accordance with the transition provisions in IFRS 15, the Group has adopted the new requirements retrospectively and has reclassified certain balance sheet receivables and payables for the 2017 financial year. The Group has applied certain practical expedients on initial application including the exemption from the requirement to apply the standard to contracts that begin and end within the same annual reporting period and contracts completed before 1 January 2017. These practical expedients did not have a material effect on the financial statements. The accounting policies, as disclosed in the Annual Report and Accounts for 31 December 2017, have not materially changed. Particular areas for consideration have been in respect of the growing B2B Energy Supply Segment which supplies to businesses ranging from micro-businesses to large Industrial & Commercial participants. Larger customers actively rather than passively renew their supply contracts. These contracts have been separated into two main categories; those with a fixed price for a contracted period of time, and those with a variable or flexible price where the contract price varies according to changes in the cost of supply. For fixed price contracts, progress is measured with reference to the costs of supply incurred at the point the energy is delivered and revenue is accrued or deferred accordingly. For variable rate and flexible contracts, revenue is recognised at a point in time when the energy is supplied and is measured at the contracted price per unit supplied. The B2B Energy Supply business accrues revenue based on estimated usage each period and this is recognised in the balance sheet as accrued income. Where the consideration received from the customer is in advance of supply, revenue is deferred on the balance sheet. Generation revenue continues to be recognised at the point of delivery. Activities within the scope of IFRS 9 (see below) are outside the scope of IFRS 15. IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments IFRS 9 Financial Instruments replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, bringing together all three aspects of accounting for financial instruments: classification and measurement; impairment; and hedge accounting which has been fully adopted by the Group. On transition to IFRS 9, the key change in the Group’s accounting policy for financial instruments is to recognise the ‘cost of hedging’ (explained below) initially in a reserve, rather than the income statement. Amounts are subsequently reclassified from the cost of hedging reserve and recognised in cost of sales in the same period as the hedged item. This change in policy has been applied retrospectively with comparative information for the period beginning 1 January 2017 being adjusted as though the cost of hedging approach had always been applied for those derivatives that existed at or since 1 January 2017. Unrealised fair value gains and losses on cash flow hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income. Gains and losses relating to fuel purchases, which will be recycled to inventory in the balance sheet, are released directly from the hedge reserve. Prior year comparatives have not been restated for other aspects of IFRS 9, as the effect is not material. In respect of accounting for trade and other receivables, the Group has applied IFRS 9’s simplified approach to provisioning and has calculated this using lifetime expected losses. This calculation has had no material impact on the financial statements. The transition to the new standard is complete; however, the Group will monitor emerging developments and interpretations of the new standard. Changes in presentation of income statement All gains and losses on derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are included in revenue or cost of sales as and when they arise. However, since the purpose of the derivative contracts concerned is to hedge certain risk exposures, principally commodity price and foreign currency risks, a columnar format has been adopted for the income statement in which adjusted results are presented, excluding certain gains and losses arising from remeasuring derivative contracts to fair value. The purpose of adjusted results is to reflect sales of electricity and purchases of fuel at the contracted price. This includes the effect of relevant financial derivatives (such as forward foreign currency contracts) used to secure the all in sale or purchase price of the commodity concerned ----- ###### SECTION 8: REFERENCE INFORMATION continued 8.3 ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND CHANGE IN PRESENTATION OF INCOME STATEMENT continued The adjusted results therefore in effect apply the accounting treatment that would have applied under IFRS 9 had the derivative contracts concerned qualified for hedge accounting. This is consistent with the practice followed by other major UK power generation companies. This change has been applied retrospectively but has not changed the prior year results, only their presentation. The impact on the previously reported amounts in the income statement and statement of comprehensive income, due to changes in accounting policies, are set out in the tables below. There have been no changes to the balance sheet other than the creation of a cost of hedging reserve. Impact on the income statement (increase/(decrease)) for: Year ended 31 December 2017 As previously reported £m Adoption of IFRS 9 £m Year ended 31 December 2017 Restated £m Representation of income statement £m Total results a) b)   Total results Revenue 3,685.2 – (0.9) 3,684.3 Cost of sales (3,140.2) – (176.0) (3,316.2) Gross profit 545.0 – (176.9) 368.1 Operating and administrative expenses (316.1) 18.7 – (297.4) Impairment losses on trade receivables – (18.7) – (18.7) Depreciation (122.7) – – (122.7) Amortisation (43.6) – – (43.6) Loss on disposal (15.4) – – (15.4) Other losses (0.4) – – (0.4) Unrealised losses on derivative contracts (156.1) (20.8) 176.9 – Acquisition and restructuring costs (7.8) – – (7.8) Operating loss (117.1) (20.8) – (137.9) Foreign exchange losses (10.6) – – (10.6) Interest payable and similar charges (55.7) – – (55.7) Interest receivable 0.2 – – 0.2 Loss before tax (183.2) (20.8) – (204.0) Total tax charge 32.1 4.0 – 36.1 Restated loss for the period (151.1) (16.8) – (167.9) Loss per share – Basic (37.2) (41.3) – Diluted (36.8) (40.9) Impact on total comprehensive income (increase/(decrease)) for: Year ended 31 December 2017 Adjustments £m Total comprehensive expense – as disclosed (309.7) Net impact of cost of hedging reclassification (a) 2.7 Fair value gains and losses on cash-flow hedges – released directly from reserves (a) 85.7 Deferred tax on above items (d) (19.3) Total comprehensive expense – restated (240.6) ----- 8.3 ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND CHANGE IN PRESENTATION OF INCOME STATEMENT continued (a) Adoption of IFRS 9 A large proportion of our derivative contracts relate to foreign exchange contracts, including forward contracts, options and swaps. Consistent with prior periods, the Group has continued to designate the change in fair value of the spot rate in the Group’s cash flow hedge relationships. As part of the transition, an election has been made to apply the cost of hedging approach resulting in the change in fair value associated with forward points, including currency basis, being initially recognised in equity and subsequently reclassified to profit or loss. This change in policy has been applied retrospectively. As a result, the Group reclassified £57.5 million of cumulative losses to the new cost of hedging reserve on initial application and restated the 2017 financial results to reflect £20.8 million of gains (plus associated tax of £4.0 million) in the cost of hedging reserve. Fair value gains and losses on cash flow hedges of £85.7 million that relate to fuel purchases, which were recycled to inventory in the balance sheet, have been restated as though they were released directly from reserves and therefore are no longer recognised in Other comprehensive income. The related deferred tax of £(15.6) million has also been reallocated. Impairment losses on trade receivables are now disclosed separately on the face of the income statement (previously included within operational and administrative expenses). Application of IFRS 9 has not had a material impact on the value of trade receivable impairment losses. b) Representation of the income statement Unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts have been included in the line item to which they relate. (c) Other losses There were no material adjustments to the Group’s classification and measurement of financial instruments. The Group has changed its policy regarding the classification of listed equity investments from fair value through profit and loss to fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). (d) Tax charge Upon adoption of IFRS 9, deferred tax and income tax values were adjusted accordingly. 8.4 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS A related party is either an individual or entity with control or significant influence over the Group, or a company that is linked to us by investment (such as an associated company or joint venture).

No adjustment has been made to reflect the financial results of Drax Group plc or the ScottishPower Generation Group since 31 December 2017. (1) The net assets of Drax Group plc as at 31 December 2017 have been extracted without adjustment from the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017. (2) The net assets of the ScottishPower Generation Group have been extracted without adjustment from the historical financial information included in Part V (Historical Financial Information relating to the ScottishPower Generation Group) of this Circular. (3) The Unaudited Pro Forma Statement of Net Assets has been prepared on the basis that the Transaction will be treated as a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3. However, it does not reflect any fair value adjustments to the acquired assets and liabilities, as the fair value measurement of these items will only be performed at the date of Completion. The fair value adjustments, when finalised, may be material. For the purpose of the pro forma statement of net assets, the excess purchase consideration over the carrying amount of net assets of £456.8m has been attributed to property, plant & equipment. ----- ###### SECTION 8: REFERENCE INFORMATION continued 8.5 UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF THE ENLARGED GROUP continued The preliminary uplift in the value of property, plant & equipment has been calculated as follows: £m £m Total consideration paid 702.0 Net liabilities of the ScottishPower Generation Group (253.8) Purchase consideration in excess of net liabilities 955.8 Adjustments for Related Party balances to be settled as part of the transaction: – Amounts receivable from Related Parties 117.0 – Amounts payable to Related Parties (113.6) – Related Party borrowings (502.4) Preliminary uplift in value of Property, plant & equipment 456.8 Upon completion of the acquisition, the Drax Group will draw down on an acquisition bridge facility with a maximum value of £725m. For the purpose of the unaudited pro forma statement of net assets, the entire purchase price of £702m plus estimated acquisitionrelated costs of £23m have been funded by the acquisition bridge facility. Drax may use available cash reserves to reduce the amount drawn on completion. The acquisition-related costs are not included in the calculation of the preliminary uplift as they will be expensed as transaction costs or capitalised as borrowing costs, as required by IFRS. £18m of the acquisition-related costs are expected to be directly attributable to the purchase of the ScottishPower Generation Group. These costs will be expensed in the income statement. £5m of the acquisition-related costs are expected to be directly attributable to the acquisition bridge facility. These costs will be capitalised and offset against total borrowings and are expected to be amortised over the 19-month term of the bridge facility as required by IFRS. This increases interest payable by £3.2m (being 12/19 months’ amortisation of these costs) and reducing borrowings by £1.8m in the unaudited pro forma statements. ----- 8.5 UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF THE ENLARGED GROUP continued Part 2 Unaudited Pro Forma Income Statement of the Enlarged Group Adjustments Adjustments £m (Note 3) Drax Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2017 £m (Note 1) ScottishPower Generation Group for the year ended 31 December 2017 £m (Note 2) Pro forma Enlarged Group £m Revenue 3,685.2 641.3 – 4,326.5 Fuel costs in respect of generation (1,356.8) (294.8) – (1,651.6) Cost of power purchases (974.6) – – (974.6) Grid Charges (498.7) (36.7) – (535.4) Other energy supply costs (310.1) (201.8) – (511.9) Total cost of sales (3,140.2) (533.3) – (3,673.5) Gross profit 545.0 108.0 – 653.0 Operating and administrative expenses (316.1) (52.7) – (368.8) Overheads allocated by Related Parties – (19.2) – (19.2) EBITDA 228.9 36.1 – 265.0 Depreciation and amortisation (166.3) (17.4) – (183.7) Asset obsolescence charges – (0.8) – (0.8) Other losses (0.4) – – (0.4) Acquisition–related costs (7.8) – (18.0) (25.8) (Loss)/gain on disposal (15.4) 1.6 – (13.8) Unrealised gains on derivative contracts (156.1) – – (156.1) Operating (loss)/profit (117.1) 19.5 (18.0) (115.6) Interest payable and similar charges (66.3) (6.8) (29.8) (102.9) Interest receivable 0.2 0.1 – 0.3 (Loss)/Profit before tax (183.2) 12.8 (47.8) (218.2) Taxation 32.1 1.0 9.2 42.3 (Loss)/Profit for the year attributable to equity holders (151.1) 13.8 (38.6) (175.9) Notes No adjustment has been made to reflect any synergies that may arise after the transaction has completed.
