-----

Prospective purchasers that are QIBs are hereby notified that the seller of the securities will be relying on
the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the US Securities Act pursuant to Rule 144A.

You are reminded that the preliminary offering memorandum has been delivered to you on the basis that
you are a person into whose possession the preliminary offering memorandum may be lawfully delivered in
accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which you are located and you may not, nor are you authorised to,
deliver the preliminary offering memorandum to any other person.

The materials relating to the offering do not constitute, and may not be used in connection with, an offer or
solicitation in any place where offers or solicitations are not permitted by law. If a jurisdiction requires that the
offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and the initial purchasers or any affiliate of the initial purchasers
is a licensed broker or dealer in that jurisdiction, the offering shall be deemed to be made by the initial purchasers
or such affiliate on behalf of the issuers in such jurisdiction.

Under no circumstances shall the preliminary offering memorandum constitute an offer to sell or the
solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any jurisdiction in which such
offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.

**MiFID II Product Governance/Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market:** Solely for the
purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the New
Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the New Notes is eligible counterparties and
professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the New Notes to
eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or
recommending the New Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market
assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market
assessment in respect of the New Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market
assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**PRIIPs Regulation/Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors: The New Notes are not intended to be**
offered or sold to and should not be offered or sold to any retail investor in the European Economic Area
(“EEA”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as
defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution
Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1)
of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Directive. No key information document
required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the
New Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared. Offering or
selling the New Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful
under the PRIIPs Regulation.

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the New Notes in any Member
State of the EEA will be made pursuant to the exemption under the Prospectus Directive from a requirement to
publish a prospectus for offers of New Notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of
the Prospectus Directive and any relevant implementing measure in each member state of the EEA.

In addition, the preliminary offering memorandum is not being distributed by, nor has it been approved for
the purposes of section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, as amended (the “FSMA”) by, a
person authorised under the FSMA. The preliminary offering memorandum is only being distributed to and is
only directed at persons who (i) are outside the United Kingdom, (ii) have professional experience in matters
relating to investments (being investment professionals falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005, as amended (the “Financial Promotion Order”)), (iii) fall
within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (“high net worth companies, unincorporated associations, etc.”) of the Financial
Promotion Order, or (iv) to the extent that doing so does not prejudice the lawful distribution of the preliminary
offering memorandum to the foregoing, are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in
investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) in connection with the issue or sale of any
New Notes may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together
being referred to as “relevant persons”). Accordingly, by accepting delivery of the preliminary offering
memorandum, the recipient warrants and acknowledges that it is such a relevant person. The preliminary offering
memorandum is directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted or relied upon by persons who are not

**SUBJECT TO COMPLETION DATED 29 APRIL 2019**


**PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM** **STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL**
**NOT FOR GENERAL DISTRIBUTION**
**IN THE UNITED STATES**

## Drax Finco plc


**$200,000,000 6** **[5]⁄8% Senior Secured Notes due 2025**
_Guaranteed on a senior secured basis by Drax Group Holdings Limited and certain of its subsidiaries_


Drax Finco plc, a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales (the “Issuer”), is offering $200 million aggregate principal amount of
its 6 [5]⁄8% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (the “New Notes”).

The New Notes will be issued pursuant to an indenture dated 26 April 2018, as amended and supplemented from time to time, including by a supplemental
indenture dated as of 12 February 2019, and by a supplemental indenture to be entered into on or prior to the Issue Date (the “Indenture”), pursuant to which the Issuer
issued $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 6 [5]⁄8% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 on 26 April 2018 (the “Initial Notes”, and, together with the New Notes,
the “Notes”). The New Notes will be a part of the same series as the Issuer’s Initial Notes and will be treated as a single class for all purposes of the Indenture, including,
without limitation, with respect to waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase, except as otherwise specified. Upon completion of this Offering,
$500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Notes will be outstanding. The New Notes will have the same ISINs and CUSIPs as the Initial Notes, provided that the New
Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the US Securities Act (as defined below) (the “Regulation S New Notes”) will initially be issued
bearing a temporary ISIN and CUSIP that differ from the ISIN and CUSIP under which the Initial Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S (the
“Regulation S Initial Notes”) were issued, and will initially trade separately from the Regulation S Initial Notes. The consolidation date for the Regulation S New Notes
will be 40 days after the later of (i) the Issue Date and (ii) the date on which the New Notes were first offered to persons other than distributors as defined in
Regulation S under the US Securities Act. On and from the consolidation date, the Regulation S New Notes will be consolidated, and fully fungible, with the Regulation
S Initial Notes.

The New Notes will bear interest at the rate of 6.625% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrear on 1 May and 1 November of each year, commencing on
1 November 2019. The New Notes will mature on 1 November 2025. The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole or in part at any time on or after 1 May 2021 at the
redemption prices specified in this offering memorandum (the “Offering Memorandum”). At any time prior to 1 May 2021, the Issuer will be entitled, at its option, to
redeem all or a portion of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts,
if any, plus a “make-whole” premium, as described in this Offering Memorandum. At any time prior to 1 May 2021, the Issuer will also be entitled, at its option, to
redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including the original principal amount of any Additional Notes issued after the Issue Date) with the
net proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price set forth in this Offering Memorandum, if at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the
Notes (including the original principal amount of any Additional Notes issued after the Issue Date) remains outstanding after such redemption. The Issuer may also
redeem all, but not less than all, of the New Notes upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law. Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a
change of control, the Issuer may be required to make an offer to purchase all of the outstanding Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof
plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any. See “Description of Notes” for further information.

The Initial Notes are, and the New Notes will be, senior secured obligations of the Issuer, and the Initial Notes rank, and the New Notes will rank, pari passu in
right of payment with all of the Issuer’s existing and future senior obligations. The Initial Notes are, and the New Notes will be, guaranteed on a senior secured basis (the
“Guarantees” and each, a “Guarantee”) by Drax Group Holdings Limited (“DGHL”) and certain of DGHL’s direct and indirect subsidiaries (the “Subsidiary
**Guarantors” and, together with DGHL, the “Guarantors”). Each of the Guarantees will rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future obligations of**
each Guarantor, including the guarantees of the Notes, and will rank senior in right of payment with all existing and future obligations of each Guarantor that are
expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee. The New Notes and the Guarantees will (subject to the Agreed Security Principles (as defined herein)) be
secured by security interests over (i) all of the issued share capital of DGHL and the Issuer; (ii) certain receivables owed to Drax Group plc by DGHL; (iii) all of the
issued share capital of each Subsidiary Guarantor; (iv) substantially all of the assets of the Issuer, including the receivables owed to the Issuer in respect of the New
Proceeds Loan pursuant to which the proceeds of the Offering are on-lent; and (v) substantially all of the assets of each Guarantor other than any real property located in
the United States (collectively, the “Collateral”).

The Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral are, or will be, subject to restrictions on enforcement and other intercreditor arrangements. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and_
_Security” for further information. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein) in the event of a distressed disposal of the Collateral or an_
enforcement of the security interests over the Collateral, the holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from such Collateral only after the lenders under the Senior
Facilities Agreement (as defined herein), counterparties to certain hedging agreements (including under the Secured Trading Line (as defined herein)) and lenders or
creditors under certain other indebtedness permitted to be incurred on a priority basis under the Indenture (subject to the Intercreditor Agreement) have been repaid in
full. Any remaining amounts from the proceeds of the enforcement of the Collateral will then be applied, pari passu and pro rata, to amounts due under the 2018 Bridge
Facility, the 2022 Notes, the Notes, and any pari passu additional indebtedness incurred in the future and then outstanding. The Issuer’s obligations in respect of the
Notes may be released in certain circumstances. In addition, the Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral may be released under certain circumstances. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and Our Capital Structure”, “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”,
“Description of Notes—Note Guarantees—Releases of the Note Guarantees”, “Description of the Additional Notes—Security—Release of Liens” for further information.

The Initial Notes have been listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange’s Euro
MTF Market (the “Euro MTF Market”). Application will be made for the New Notes to likewise be admitted. However, there is no assurance that this application will
be accepted. The Euro MTF Market is not a regulated market pursuant to the provisions of Directive 2004/39/EC on markets in financial instruments, as amended. This
Offering Memorandum constitutes a prospectus for purposes of Luxembourg Law on Prospectuses for Securities dated 10 July 2005, as amended.

The New Notes will be issued in registered form in minimum denominations of $200,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The New Notes will be
represented by one or more global notes, which we expect will be delivered to investors in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) on or
about the Issue Date. Interests in a global note will be exchangeable for the relevant definitive Notes only in certain limited circumstances. See “Book-Entry; Delivery
_and Form”._

**Investing in the New Notes involves a high degree of risk. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 32**


**Price for the New Notes:** **% plus accrued and unpaid interest from 1 May 2019**

**The New Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the US Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “US Securities Act”), or**
**the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and may not be offered or sold within the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction**
**not subject to, the registration requirements of the US Securities Act. In the United States, this offering is being made only to “qualified institutional buyers”**
**(as defined in Rule 144A under the US Securities Act) in compliance with Rule 144A under the US Securities Act (“Rule 144A”). You are hereby notified that**
**the Initial Purchasers (as defined herein) of the New Notes may be relying on the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the US Securities Act provided**
**by Rule 144A. Outside of the United States, this offering is being made to non-US persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the US**
**Securities Act. See “Plan of Distribution” and “Notice to Investors” for additional information about eligible offerees and resale restrictions.**

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS IN**
**THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA**

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of New Notes in any Member
State of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) which has implemented the Prospectus Directive (each, a
“Relevant Member State”) will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Directive from the
requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of New Notes. Accordingly any person making or intending to
make an offer in that Relevant Member State of New Notes which are the subject of the Offering contemplated in
this Offering Memorandum may only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Issuer or any
of the Initial Purchasers to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive, in each case, in
relation to such offer. Neither the Issuer nor any of the Initial Purchasers have authorised, nor do they authorise,
the making of any offer of New Notes in circumstances in which an obligation arises for the Issuer or any of the
Initial Purchasers to publish a prospectus for such offer. The expression “Prospectus Directive” means Directive

v


-----

2003/71/EC (as amended or superseded, including by Directive 2010/73/EU), and includes any relevant
implementing measure in the Relevant Member State.

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in
respect of the New Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the New Notes is eligible
counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”);
and (ii) all channels for distribution of the New Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are
appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the New Notes (a “distributor”) should
take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is
responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the New Notes (by either adopting or
refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

The New Notes are not intended to be offered or sold to and should not be offered or sold to any retail
investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is
one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the
meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer
would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a
qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Directive. No key information document required by Regulation
(EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the New Notes or otherwise
making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared. Offering or selling the New Notes or
otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.
Due to such uncertainties and risks, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking

performance and the industry in which we operate.

no obligation to publicly update or publicly revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable
to us or to persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements
referred to above and contained elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, including those set forth under “Risk

constitute statutory accounts within the meaning of section 434(3) of the UK Companies Act 2006 (the
“Companies Act”). Statutory accounts for Drax Group plc for the financial years ended 31 December 2016,
2017 and 2018 have been reported on by the company’s auditor and delivered to the registrar of companies. The
reports of the auditor were (i) unqualified, (ii) did not include a reference to any matters to which the auditor
drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying their reports, and (iii) did not contain a statement under
section 498(2) or (3) of the Companies Act.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying our
accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions
and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in the Group’s audited consolidated
financial statements.

-----

The financial information included in this Offering Memorandum is not intended to comply with the
applicable accounting requirements of the US Securities Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC,
which would apply if the New Notes were being registered with the SEC. There could be significant differences
between IFRS and generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“US GAAP”), as
applied to the Group. We neither describe the differences between IFRS and US GAAP nor reconcile the Group’s
IFRS financial statements to US GAAP. Accordingly, such information is not available to investors, and
investors should consider this in making their investment decision. The Indenture imposes no obligation on us to
reconcile our future financial statements prepared under IFRS to US GAAP.

See “Independent Auditors” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and Our Capital
_Structure—Investors in and purchasers of the New Notes may have limited or no recourse against our_
_independent auditors in respect of the Drax Group Audited Financial Statements” for a description of the_
independent auditors’ reports of Deloitte LLP.

**Comparability of Drax Group Audited Financial Statements**

The Group’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended 31 December 2018 are
not directly comparable with the Group’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended
31 December 2016 and 2017, due to (i) the adoption of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which took effect as of
1 January 2018, and (ii) the change in presentation of the Group’s consolidated income statement for the year
ended 31 December 2018 to include unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts in the line item to which
they relate (revenue or cost of sales, as applicable), instead of in a separate line item below gross profit. The
unaudited comparative information as of and for the year ended 31 December 2017 included in the Group’s
audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended 31 December 2018 has been restated in
order to give effect to the adoption of IFRS 9 as if it had occurred on 1 January 2017 and has been re-presented to
reflect the change in presentation of unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts. Financial information
derived from such unaudited comparative information as of and for the year ended 31 December 2017 is
presented as “restated” where is appears in this Offering Memorandum. In this Offering Memorandum, we
present financial information for the year ended 31 December 2017 on a restated and non-restated basis.
Additionally, financial information for the year ended 31 December 2016 has not been restated or re-presented in
accordance with the aforementioned changes in accounting policy and income statement presentation,
respectively, which may affect the comparability of results on a year-to-year basis for the historical results of
operations included in this Offering Memorandum and future periods with historical results of operations. For
more information on (i) the impact of IFRS 9 on our financial information and (ii) the change in presentation of
unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts in our income statement, see Note 8.3 to the 2018 Drax Group
Audited Financial Statements.

**DGEL Group Financial Information and Pro Forma Financial Information**

We present Acquired Revenue of DGEL, revenue of SMW, Acquired Revenue of the DGEL Group,
Adjusted EBITDA of DGEL, EBITDA of SMW, Adjusted EBITDA of the DGEL Group, Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin solely to show how the
DGEL Acquisition would have impacted the Drax Group’s Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Revenue and Adjusted
EBITDA Margin for the year ended 31 December 2018 had it occurred on 1 January 2018. The unaudited DGEL,
SMW, DGEL Group and pro forma financial information for the year ended 31 December 2018 (i) has been
prepared for illustrative purposes only; (ii) does not purport to represent what our actual Adjusted EBITDA,
Adjusted Revenue or Adjusted EBITDA Margin would have been if the foregoing events had occurred on
1 January 2018; (iii) does not purport to project our Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Revenue or Adjusted EBITDA
Margin at any future date and (iv) may not be comparable to the consolidated financial statements or other
financial information of the Group included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The unaudited DGEL,
SMW, DGEL Group and pro forma financial information set forth in this Offering Memorandum is for
informational purposes only and is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. The unaudited DGEL, SMW,
DGEL Group and pro forma financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum has been derived
from the preliminary unaudited management accounts for DGEL and SMW, respectively, for the year ended
31 December 2018, which are subject to change and have not been included in this Offering Memorandum.

The unaudited pro forma financial information has not been prepared in accordance with Article 11 of
Regulation S-X under the US Securities Act, the Prospectus Directive or any generally accepted accounting
standards.

**Non-IFRS Financial Measures**

This Offering Memorandum contains certain non-IFRS measures and ratios, including Adjusted EBITDA,
_Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Revenue, Pro forma Adjusted Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Pro_
_Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Cost of Sales, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Operating Profit,_
Adjusted Interest payable and similar charges, Adjusted Total Tax Credit/Charge, net debt, net leverage,
operating cash conversion and certain other measures (the “Non-IFRS Measures”) that are not required by, or
presented in accordance with, IFRS or the accounting standards of any other jurisdiction. We define the
following Non-IFRS Measures as follows:

   - “Adjusted EBITDA” as profit/loss for the year before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and certain
material items that do not reflect the underlying trading performance of the business;

For the years ended 31 December 2017 (restated) and 2018, Adjusted EBITDA is profit/loss for the year
before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, foreign exchange gain/loss, other gains, losses on disposals,
and excluding the impact of exceptional items (comprising acquisition and restructuring costs and asset
obsolescence charges) and certain remeasurements on derivative contracts which cannot be designated as
hedging instruments under IFRS, as presented in our income statement for the year ended 31 December
2018.

For the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2017, Adjusted EBITDA is profit/loss for the year before interest,
tax, depreciation, amortisation, foreign exchange gain/loss, other gains, losses on disposals, unrealised gains and
losses on derivative contracts, acquisition and restructuring costs and other losses, as presented as EBITDA in our
income statements for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2017, respectively.

   - “Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA” as the sum of the Adjusted EBITDA of the Group for the year ended
31 December 2018 and the Adjusted EBITDA of the DGEL Group for year ended 31 December 2018;

As the DGEL Acquisition was completed on 31 December 2018, no income, expenditure or cash flows with
respect to the DGEL Group have been included in the Drax Group Audited Financial Statements. Pro
_Forma Adjusted EBITDA gives effect to the DGEL Acquisition as if it had occurred on 1 January 2018 and_
excludes the effect of (i) EBITDA attributable to assets not acquired by the Group, (ii) the impact of a oneoff stamp duty charge recognised as a result of the DGEL Acquisition and (iii) the Group’s estimate of
central overhead costs that would not have been incurred by DGEL had it been owned by the Group.

_Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA does not purport to indicate our future consolidated results of operations. Our_
actual results may differ significantly from those reflected in the Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA information.

The calculation of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is derived from the addition of the following components:

      - Adjusted EBITDA of the Group: this information is derived from our consolidated income
statement information for the year ended 31 December 2018; and

      - Adjusted EBITDA of the DGEL Group: the calculation of the Adjusted EBITDA of the DGEL
Group is derived from the addition of the following components:

         - Adjusted EBITDA of DGEL: this information is derived from preliminary unaudited
management accounts of DGEL for the year ended 31 December 2018; and

         - EBITDA of SMW: this information is derived from preliminary unaudited management
accounts of SMW for the year ended 31 December 2018.

Adjusted EBITDA of DGEL means profit/loss for the year before interest, tax, depreciation,
amortisation, excluding the effect of (i) EBITDA attributable to assets not acquired by the Group,
(ii) the impact of a one-off stamp duty charge recognised as a result of the DGEL Acquisition and
(iii) central overhead costs that would not have been incurred by DGEL had it been owned by the
Group. EBITDA in respect of SMW means profit/loss for the year before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortisation. The Drax Group Audited Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum do not reflect the Adjusted EBITDA of the DGEL Group for the year ended
31 December 2018 and such measure has not been audited, reviewed or verified by an independent
accounting firm and is preliminary and subject to change.

   - “Adjusted Revenue” as revenue excluding the impact of certain remeasurements on derivative contracts
which cannot be designated as hedging instruments under IFRS;

xiii


-----

   - “Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue” as the sum of Adjusted Revenue of the Group and the Acquired Revenue
of the DGEL Group, in each case, for the year ended 31 December 2018;

_Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue does not purport to indicate our future consolidated revenue. Our actual_
revenue may differ significantly from the revenue reflected in the Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue
information.

The calculation of Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue is derived from the addition of the following components:

      - Adjusted Revenue of the Group: this information is derived from our consolidated income
statement information for the year ended 31 December 2018; and

      - Acquired Revenue of the DGEL Group: the calculation of Acquired Revenue of the DGEL Group
is derived from the addition of the following components:

         - Acquired Revenue of DGEL: this information is derived from preliminary unaudited
management accounts of DGEL for the year ended 31 December 2018 and excludes revenue
attributable to assets not acquired by the Group; and

         - Revenue of SMW: this information is derived from preliminary unaudited management
accounts of SMW for the year ended 31 December 2018.

The Drax Group Audited Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum do not
reflect the Acquired Revenue of the DGEL Group for the year ended 31 December 2018 and such measure
has not been audited, reviewed or verified by an independent accounting firm.

   - “Adjusted EBITDA Margin” as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Adjusted Revenue;

   - “Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin” for the year ended 31 December 2018 as Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA divided by Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue;

   - “Adjusted Cost of Sales” as cost of sales excluding the impact of certain remeasurements on derivative
contracts which cannot be designated as hedging instruments under IFRS;

   - “Adjusted Gross Profit” as gross profit excluding the impact of certain remeasurements on derivative
contracts which cannot be designated as hedging instruments under IFRS;

   - “Adjusted Operating Profit” as operating profit excluding the impact of exceptional items and certain
remeasurements on derivative contracts which cannot be designated as hedging instruments under IFRS;

   - “Adjusted Interest payable and similar charges” as interest payable and similar charges excluding the
impact of debt restructuring costs associated with the refinancing of the Group’s debt;

   - “Adjusted Total Tax Credit/Charge” as total tax credit/charge excluding the tax impact of exceptional
items and certain remeasurements on derivative contracts which cannot designated as hedging
instruments under IFRS;

   - “net debt” as current and non-current borrowings and overdrafts (net of deferred finance costs) less cash
and cash equivalents;

   - “net leverage” as the ratio of consolidated net debt to Adjusted EBITDA; and

   - “operating cash conversion” as net cash generated from operating activities of the Drax Group divided by
Adjusted EBITDA expressed as a percentage.

We believe that the presentation of the Non-IFRS Measures enhances an investor’s understanding of our
operating performance and our ability to service our debt. In addition, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a
measure commonly used by investors. Our Non-IFRS Measures may not be comparable with similarly titled
measures used by other companies. Our Adjusted EBITDA and related leverage and coverage ratios are not
measurements of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to other
indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other measure of performance derived in accordance
with IFRS. Our Non-IFRS Measures have important limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider
them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results of operations as reported under IFRS. In addition,
Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently from the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA” under the
Indenture. Some other limitations of Adjusted EBITDA-based measures include:

   - they do not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal
payments on our debt;

xiv


-----

   - they do not reflect any cash income taxes and certain other taxes that we may be required to pay;

   - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash
flows; and

   - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not to be
indicative of our ongoing operations.

Because of these limitations, our Non-IFRS Measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary
cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to
meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our IFRS results and
using these Non-IFRS Measures only in a supplemental manner to evaluate our performance.

Key performance indicators (with the exception of Adjusted Revenue, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted
EBITDA and net debt) and the other non-financial operational data included in this Offering Memorandum are
not part of our financial statements and have not been audited. Our use or computation of these indicators may
not be comparable with the use or computation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies. None of
the key performance indicators or other non-financial operating data included in this Offering Memorandum
should be considered in isolation or as an alternative to any indicator of our operating performance, cash flows or
other measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS.

For a reconciliation of each of the Non-IFRS Measures (other than those mentioned in the next sentence) to
the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS and further discussion
of the limitations of these Non-IFRS Measures, refer to “Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other
_Data—Summary historical financial and other information—Other Financial and As Adjusted Information” and_
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Performance
_Indicators”. A reconciliation of each of Adjusted Cost of Sales, Adjusted Operating Profit, Adjusted Interest_
payable and similar items and Adjusted total tax credit/charge to the most directly comparable IFRS measure is
included within the consolidated income statement in the 2018 Drax Group Audited Financial Statements.

**_As Adjusted Financial Data_**

This Offering Memorandum includes certain unaudited financial information, presented on an as adjusted
basis to give effect to the Transactions. The unaudited as adjusted financial information is for illustrative
purposes only and is not intended to represent or to be indicative of the consolidated results of operations or
financial position the Group would have reported had (i) the Transactions been completed as of 1 January 2018
for the purposes of the calculation of as adjusted interest expense or (ii) the Transactions been completed as of
31 December 2018 for the purposes of the calculation of as adjusted cash and cash equivalents, as adjusted
consolidated debt and as adjusted consolidated net debt. The unaudited as adjusted financial information should
not be taken as indicative of the Group’s future consolidated results of operations or financial position.

The as adjusted financial data has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X
under the US Securities Act, the Prospectus Directive or IFRS, US GAAP or any other generally accepted
accounting standards. Neither the assumptions underlying the as adjusted adjustments nor the resulting as
_adjusted financial data have been audited or reviewed._

You should read the as adjusted financial information in conjunction with the information contained in “Use
_of Proceeds”, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and_
the Drax Group Audited Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum.

See “Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data—Summary historical financial and other
_information—Other Financial and As Adjusted Information”._

**Rounding**

Certain numerical figures set out in this Offering Memorandum, including financial data presented in
millions or thousands and percentages describing market shares, have been subject to rounding adjustments, and,
as a result, the totals of the data in this Offering Memorandum may vary slightly from the actual arithmetic totals
of such information. Percentages and amounts reflecting changes over time periods relating to financial and other
data set forth in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” are
calculated using the numerical data in the Drax Group Audited Financial Statements (contained elsewhere in this
Offering Memorandum) or the tabular presentation of other data (subject to rounding) contained in this Offering
Memorandum, as applicable, and not using the numerical data in the narrative description thereof.

**MARKET AND INDUSTRY DATA**

In this Offering Memorandum, reference is made to information regarding our business and the market and
industry in which we operate and compete. The market data and certain economic and industry data and forecasts
used in this Offering Memorandum were obtained from governmental sources and other publicly available
information, independent industry publications and reports prepared by industry consultants. Market data and
forecasts are inherently predictive and subject to uncertainty and not necessarily reflective of actual market
conditions. Such market data and forecasts are based on market research, which itself is based on sampling and
subjective judgments by both the researchers and the respondents, including judgments about what type of
products and transactions should be included in the relevant market. While the Issuer and the Guarantors accept
responsibility for accurately extracting, reproducing and summarising this market and industry data, neither the
Issuer nor the Guarantors accept any further responsibility in respect of such information. Industry publications
and forecasts generally state that the information they contain has been obtained from sources believed to be
reliable, but that the accuracy and completeness of such information is not guaranteed. Management has not
independently verified such data and cannot guarantee their accuracy or completeness.

In addition to the foregoing, certain information regarding markets, market size, market share, market
position, growth rates and other industry data pertaining to us contained in this Offering Memorandum were
based on estimates prepared by management based on certain assumptions and management’s knowledge of the
industry in which we operate. In many cases, there is no readily available external information (whether from
trade associations, government bodies or other organisations) to validate market-related analyses and estimates,
requiring us to rely on our own internally developed estimates regarding the energy industry, our position in the
industry, our market share and the market shares of various industry participants based on management’s
experience, management’s own investigation of market conditions and management’s review of industry
publications, including information made available to the public by our competitors. Neither we nor the Initial
Purchasers can assure you of the accuracy and completeness of, or take responsibility for, such data. Similarly,
while management believes its internal estimates to be reasonable, these estimates have not been verified by any
independent sources and neither we nor the Initial Purchasers can assure you as to their accuracy or the accuracy
of the underlying assumptions used to estimate such data. Our estimates involve risks and uncertainties and are
subject to change based on various factors.

In this Offering Memorandum, certain of the references to our competitors, customers or other companies
are made by using their trade names and not their full legal names.

is annually adjusted for inflation. Generators will receive revenue
from selling their electricity to the market as usual. However, when
the market reference price is below the strike price they will also
receive a top-up payment from the CfD counterparty for the
additional amount. Conversely, if the reference price is above the
strike price, the generator must pay back the difference.

_Certain statements include forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties. See_
_“Forward-Looking Statements”._

**Overview**

We are an innovative electricity generation and supply business with operations in the UK and the US
working to enable a zero-carbon, lower-cost energy future. Our business comprises three segments with an
integrated strategy where we source and produce fuel in the form of sustainable wood pellets, generate
electricity, and supply electricity, gas and services to end customers.

We are a power generator with generation sites across the UK with a total generation capacity of
approximately 6.5GW. Our generation portfolio consists of Drax Power Station and the generation assets of
DGEL, which we acquired through the DGEL Acquisition in December 2018. Drax Power Station is our single
largest generation asset and is comprised of our four biomass and two coal generation units and our remaining
generation assets comprise a diversified portfolio of pumped storage, hydro and gas generation assets. Our
generation assets are located in England and Scotland, and we have options to develop a further 6.6GW of
generation capacity in the UK.

We own and operate Drax Power Station which is the largest power plant in the UK by generation capacity
with an installed capacity of approximately 4.0GW. Drax Power Station is a critical part of the UK’s energy
infrastructure, generating approximately 5 per cent. of the UK’s total electricity, and approximately 12 per cent.
of the UK’s renewable electricity for the twelve months ended 31 December 2018. Based on the 2017-2018
compliance period, Drax Power Station is also the UK’s largest single-site generator of renewable energy. Drax
Power Station provides flexible and reliable generation and produced 18.3 TWh of electricity in 2018, of which
75 per cent. was generated from sustainable biomass, making us a core part of the UK’s decarbonisation strategy.
In August 2018, we completed the conversion of a fourth coal-fired generation unit at Drax Power Station to
biomass-fired generation at a cost of approximately £30 million (which was lower than the cost of converting
each of the previous three biomass-fired generation units). Our four biomass-fired generation units receive
regulatory support, leading to enhanced earnings streams with a significant component of stable and predictable
revenue extending to 2027. Our biomass-fired generation assets are served by an efficient and reliable biomass
supply chain comprising dedicated port handling infrastructure and rail paths, thereby enhancing security of
supply of fuel for our electricity generation activities. Currently, our two coal-fired generation units provide
important support services to the UK’s electricity system, including greater reliability and flexibility at times of
low De-rated Reserve Margins and system stress.

On 31 December 2018, we acquired ScottishPower’s multi-site, multi-technology 2.6GW portfolio of
pumped storage, hydro and gas-fired generation assets for £687 million (based on total consideration of
£702 million, less customary net debt and working capital adjustments), which we renamed Drax Generation
Enterprise Limited (“DGEL”). DGEL owns and operates the Cruachan pumped storage power plant, hydro
power plants at Galloway and Lanark and four CCGT power stations in Southern and Northern England. This
portfolio of generation assets significantly diversifies our generation capacity, expands our flexible, low-carbon
and renewable generation business model and increases our ability to provide system support services to the UK
energy system. Our acquisition of DGEL accelerates our development from a single-site generation business into
a multi-site, multi-technology national power generator.

We are further responding to the growth in intermittent renewable capacity on the electricity grid by
developing a pipeline of flexible power options, including options to develop up to four 299MW rapid-response

standalone OCGT projects and options to repower one or both of our remaining coal-fired generation units at
Drax Power Station to gas-fired generation with supporting battery storage technology. In addition, our newly
acquired Damhead Creek site benefits from an option for the development of a further CCGT asset, Damhead
Creek II, which would provide us with an additional 1.8GW of gas generation capacity. Each of these projects
has the potential to provide flexible and reliable electricity to the UK electricity system and further diversify our
future energy generation capability. However, each project is subject to a positive investment decision and would
require appropriate support through the Capacity Market. In November 2018, payments under the Capacity
Market were suspended following a ruling by the General Court of the European Union. We expect that this issue
will be resolved and that the Capacity Market will be re-established on the same or similar terms during 2019,
consistent with the position expressed by the Government. For further information on the Capacity Market, see
“Industry Overview—Overview of Electricity Market Reform— Capacity Market” and “Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to Our Business and Industry—The Capacity Market in the UK is currently suspended and its future is_
_uncertain”._

Our B2B Energy Supply segment, comprising Haven Power and Opus, is the fifth largest supplier of
electricity to businesses in the UK by volume supplied as of 31 October 2018 and the largest provider of
renewable energy to businesses. As of 31 December 2018, we supplied over 396,000 electricity and gas meters
and, in 2018, we supplied 20.9 TWh of electricity and gas. Our B2B Energy Supply segment had an 11 per cent.
share of the B2B electricity market as at 31 October 2018 and provides us with a direct route to market for much
of the electricity we generate. We believe that B2B counterparties place fewer credit restrictions on us than
wholesale market counterparties and selling to this market provides us with a more diversified counterparty base
with less concentrated counterparty credit risk.

We produce compressed wood pellets from sustainable sources in three plants in the southern US and use
those pellets as fuel for our biomass-fired generation, which provided 18.0 per cent. of our biomass need in the
year ended 31 December 2018. Following the successful commissioning in 2018 of our third wood pellet
manufacturing facility, our LaSalle facility located in Urania, Louisiana, all three of our wood pellet
manufacturing facilities have the capability to manufacture wood pellets at their nameplate capacity. We
produced 1.35 million tonnes of wood pellets in 2018 representing a 64 per cent. increase on production in 2017
and are increasing capacity at our LaSalle and Morehouse facilities by 175,000 tonnes in aggregate by 2021
(which would represent a 13 per cent. increase on our current production capacity when the incremental capacity,
is fully commissioned), which we anticipate will incur a small fraction of the equivalent cost of building a new
pellet production plant. In addition to self-supply from our manufacturing facilities, we have a network of third
party suppliers of wood pellets and to this end we have entered into long-term contracts with other wood pellet
suppliers in North America and Europe to support a long-term, stable supply of biomass.

Drax Group plc is listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange under stock ticker “DRX”, and
is part of the FTSE 250 Index. Drax Group plc’s market capitalisation as at 25 April 2019 was approximately
£1,366.7 million. As at 31 December 2018, our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA was £249.6 million at market
close and our consolidated net debt as at 31 December 2018 was £319.1 million (noting that if our US dollar
balances relating to the Initial Notes are translated at the hedged rate, rather than the rate prevailing at
31 December 2018, our net debt would have been reduced by £22.0 million). We acquired DGEL on
31 December 2018 and paid the initial consideration due to the vendor on 2 January 2019 using a combination of
£550 million drawn under the 2018 Bridge Facility and £137 million of cash reserves. Accordingly, no profit or
loss has been recognised in respect of DGEL in 2018, and neither the drawing under the 2018 Bridge Facility nor
the reduction in cash in respect of the consideration paid are reflected in our consolidated net debt as at
31 December 2018. Pro forma for the Transactions, our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended
31 December 2018 was £326.8 million and our consolidated net debt as at 31 December 2018 was £1,023.6
million. See “Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data” and “Presentation of Financial

The three segments of our business are:

- Power Generation: Through our Power Generation segment, we play a significant role in providing
reliable, renewable baseload electricity generation capacity as well as important system support services,
enhancing the security of the UK’s electricity supply and supporting the UK’s transition to a low-carbon
future. Following the DGEL Acquisition, Drax is the third largest generator in the UK when taking
account of anticipated output (as published by the System Operator):

In 2018, Drax Power Station generated approximately 5 per cent. of the UK’s electricity needs and its
four sustainable biomass-fired generation units generated approximately 12 per cent. of the UK’s
renewable electricity. In 2017 and 2018, approximately 65 per cent. and 75 per cent., respectively, of
electricity generated by Drax Power Station was from sustainable biomass rather than coal. In 2018, less
than 6 per cent. of our revenue was attributable to sales of electricity generated by our coal-fired
generation units at Drax Power Station. All six generation units at Drax Power Station are the largest in
their class in the UK. Each generation unit can be operated flexibility and independently.

Drax Power Station benefits from regulatory support via the index-linked CfD and RO regimes which
provide Drax Power Station with financial support to facilitate the production of electricity. Following the
conversion of our fourth coal-fired generation unit at Drax Power Station to biomass-fired generation in
August 2018, we are able to optimise our generation in a way that maximises the revenue associated with
generating the ROCs available to Drax Power Station as a whole under the RO Scheme. Under the current
RO Scheme, three of our generation units converted to biomass are eligible to receive ROCs until March
2027. For further information on the RO Scheme and the CfD Regime, see “Industry Overview—
_Overview of the Electricity Market Reform— Contracts for Difference” and “Industry Overview—UK_
_Clean Energy Legislation—The Renewables Obligation”._

On 31 December 2018, we acquired DGEL, ScottishPower’s 2.6GW portfolio of pumped storage, hydro
and gas-fired generation assets. DGEL includes the Cruachan pumped storage power plant, hydro power
plants at Galloway and Lanark and four CCGT power stations in Southern and Northern England.
Cruachan provides over 35 per cent. of the UK’s pumped-storage capacity and is capable of generating
440MW of large-scale storage and flexible electricity continuously for 16 hours. It also provides
contracted Ancillary Services to the UK electricity system and important system support services through
the balancing market, in addition to merchant power generation. The Galloway and Lanark hydro power
plants are capable of generating up to a combined 126MW of stable renewable electricity. Lanark
(17MW) receives regulatory support from the RO Scheme, and Galloway (109MW) receives regulatory
support from the RO Scheme with respect to approximately 28MW of its generating capacity, in addition
to which it operates a reservoir and dam system providing power storage capabilities and opportunities
for peaking and system support services. Our CCGT power stations at Damhead Creek (805MW), Rye
House (715MW), Shoreham (420MW) and Blackburn Mill (60MW) provide baseload and peak power
generation, in addition to other system support services. The multi-site, multi-technology nature of this
2.6GW portfolio of generation assets significantly diversifies our generation capacity, expands our
flexible, low-carbon and renewable generation model and increases our ability to provide system support
services to the UK energy system. The System Operator has a growing need for system support services
and we have a number of contracts in place with the System Operator to supply such services.

Furthermore, we are progressing the development of options for four new 299MW OCGT plants in
England and Wales. As part of the DGEL Acquisition, the Group also acquired a permitted option for the
development of a 1.8GW CCGT plant at Damhead Creek (Damhead Creek II). Each of these plants has
the potential to provide flexible and reliable electricity to the UK electricity system and diversify our
future energy generation capability subject to a positive investment decision and appropriate support
through the Capacity Market (if and when re-established). If commissioned, each of these plants would
provide fast, flexible gas generation to support the UK electricity system at times of peak demand.

We are also developing options to repower one or both of our remaining coal-fired generation units to gas
and build supporting battery storage at Drax Power Station. The project could replace the existing
c.1.3GW of coal-fired generation capacity with up to 3.6GW of gas generation capacity (capable of
running in either open cycle and combined cycle modes) and up to 200MW of supporting battery storage,
subject to a positive investment decision, obtaining consent and other approvals and the award of one or


3


-----

more 15-year Capacity Market agreements or similar support in future Capacity Market auctions subject
to the Capacity Market being re-established.

   - B2B Energy Supply: We supply electricity to businesses through Haven Power and electricity and gas to
businesses through Opus. Both Haven Power and Opus provide us with a credit-efficient route to market
for a proportion of the electricity we generate and the ROCs that our Power Generation segment earns.
The majority of Haven Power’s sales volumes are with larger I&C customers, while Opus is focused on
SMEs. Our B2B Energy Supply segment is the fifth largest supplier of electricity to businesses in the UK
by volume supplied as of 31 October 2018 and the largest provider of renewable energy to businesses. In
2018 we supplied 17.9 TWh of electricity, representing an 11 per cent. share of the B2B electricity
market.

   - Pellet Production: Through our Pellet Production segment based in the US Gulf region, we manufacture
and supply compressed wood pellets from sustainably managed forests. We take low-grade wood and
residues from other wood processing and forestry industries and transform them into pellets that can be
transported cost-effectively to Drax Power Station to generate low-carbon energy. We operate three wood
pellet manufacturing facilities in the US Gulf region: Amite BioEnergy in Gloster, Mississippi,
Morehouse BioEnergy in Bastrop, Louisiana and LaSalle BioEnergy in Urania, Louisiana. In 2018, our
wood pellet manufacturing facilities produced approximately 1,351,000 tonnes of sustainable biomass,
representing 18.0 per cent. of our internal requirements for generation from sustainable biomass,
compared to production of approximately 822,000 tonnes being 12.3 per cent. of our internal
requirements in 2017. This increase was driven by the successful commissioning of our LaSalle facility
which has annual nameplate production capacity of 450,000 tonnes and achieved full production ahead of
schedules in 2018, an increase in annual production capacity of 75,000 tonnes at each of our Amite and
Morehouse facilities in 2017. This nameplate capacity of 1,500,000 tonnes gives us the capability to
supply a greater share of our internal requirements for generation from sustainable biomass in 2019. We
aim to increase the share of internally sourced pellets to up to 30 per cent. in the future, as part of our
broader initiative to reduce operating costs by leveraging the vertically integrated nature of our
operations. To that end, we are increasing capacity at our LaSalle and Morehouse facilities by 175,000
tonnes in aggregate by 2021. All three of our wood pellet manufacturing facilities are certified under the
Sustainable Biomass Program, an industry standard, demonstrating that their biomass is legally and
sustainably sourced. We operate a 2,700,000 tonne port facility in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, which
includes two 40,000 tonne storage domes to transport pellets from our own manufacturing facilities and
from approved third party suppliers to the UK for use by our Power Generation segment. The port facility
can load more than 15,000 tonnes of pellets per day and can accommodate 60,000 tonne Panamax
Vessels. In 2018, we also started construction of a new rail spur linking our LaSalle facility to the
regional rail network and our port facility at Baton Rouge, which will increase transportation efficiency
and economies of scale and reduce the cost and carbon footprint of our operations.

**Strengths**

**_We are a critical part of the UK’s energy infrastructure._**

We are a nationally critical low-carbon energy group and a fundamental part of the UK’s energy
infrastructure. Our current portfolio of generation assets (including those acquired in the DGEL Acquisition)
produced approximately 7 per cent. of the UK’s electricity requirements in 2018 (compared to the UK’s average
De-Rated Reserve Margin for the last five years of 7.4 per cent.), demonstrating that we are a critical participant
in the overall UK energy landscape.

In 2018, our current portfolio of generation assets, taking into account our acquisition of ScottishPower’s
portfolio of pumped storage, hydro and gas-fired generation assets on 31 December 2018, produced
approximately 13 per cent. of the UK’s renewable electricity.

Our primary generation facility, Drax Power Station, is the largest power station in the UK by generation
capacity, with approximately 4.0GW of installed capacity primarily from four biomass-fired units and two coalfired units. Through our biomass-fired generation units, Drax Power Station is also the largest single-site
renewable energy generation asset in the UK. Our generation units at Drax Power Station are also the most
efficient units in their class in the UK, enabling them to run profitably at times when others cannot. Each of the
generation units at Drax Power Station can be operated independently and has the flexibility to generate


4


-----

electricity at varying levels of output, enabling these generation units to provide a range of generation and system
support services to the electricity network.

Our acquisition of ScottishPower’s 2.6GW portfolio of pumped storage, hydro and gas-fired generation
assets has further extended and diversified our generation capacity and capability, expanding our flexible, lowcarbon and renewable generation model and increasing our ability to provide system support services to the UK
energy system. Following the DGEL Acquisition, Drax is the third largest generator in the UK when taking
account of anticipated output (as published by the System Operator). Our pumped storage, hydro and CCGT
assets increase our capability to provide the flexibility increasingly required by the UK energy system to enable
higher levels of intermittent renewable generation in the UK energy market while delivering contract-based
revenues.

**_We are a key player in the UK’s transition to a lower carbon economy._**

The UK electricity market has been experiencing a period of significant structural change. In the last
decade, there has been an increase in inflexible, renewable generation technology, combined with the closure of
significant volumes of thermal plant which historically have been able to provide the grid with a combination of
both baseload and flexible generation. We are strategically placed to fill this gap and support this longer-term
transition to a low-carbon, lower-cost UK electricity system through our portfolio of lower-carbon and renewable
generation assets, and in particular our ability to provide up to 2.5GW of reliable baseload generation via our
four biomass units at Drax Power Station after converting these units from coal in anticipation of coal generation
being phased out in the UK.

Looking forward, as the UK is expected to phase out coal-fired generation by 2025, gas-fired generation
will be the key transitional generation technology in addition to biomass generation that enables and supports this
long-term transition. As part of this transition, we are developing a pipeline of options, which could include
repowering the remaining two coal-fired generation units at Drax Power Station to gas, leveraging expertise from
prior conversions and using existing infrastructure at Drax Power Station. If developed, each repowered unit will
deliver stable, contract-based earnings and extend the operating life of Drax Power Station through the late
2030s, whilst each providing 1.8GW of generation capacity. Our pipeline of options also includes further gas
generation opportunities ranging from the development of up to four 299MW rapid-response OCGT projects to
developing our Damhead Creek II site into a 1.8GW CCGT plant. These options and the development
opportunities they represent will ensure that we continue to play a key role in the UK’s transition to a lower
carbon economy. See “Business—Principal Activities and Markets—Power Generation—Gas development
_projects”._

**_We are a leading provider of system support services to the UK electricity system._**

The transformation of the UK electricity market set out above will also result in an increased need for
system support services to be provided the UK electricity grid. Our recent acquisition of DGEL further improves
our position to take advantage of these changing dynamics.

Between 2012 and 2018, 20GW of flexible, thermal generation capacity was decommissioned and replaced
by more than 30GW of intermittent renewable generation. This trend is expected to increase and the UK has a
stated target to increase the proportion of its electricity generation from wind to 30 per cent. by 2030 and a wider
commitment to reducing carbon emissions by 80 per cent. by 2050 (compared to 1990 levels).

However, intermittent renewable generation is dependent on favourable weather conditions and so is less
able to respond to fluctuations in electricity demand. For example, recent extreme weather events (for example,
changes in the behaviour of the polar vortex) and corresponding peaks in demand in recent years have
demonstrated the limitations of intermittent generation. In Winter 2016/2017 and Winter 2017/2018, the UK and
Europe experienced extended periods of very low temperatures coupled with little to no wind, putting strain on
UK and European system infrastructure and leading to elevated electricity prices generally and large spikes in the
electricity price during certain periods.

To achieve the UK’s 2050 commitment and support the increase in intermittent wind and solar generation
there will be a need for complementary flexible generation assets that can provide system support services and
alter their generation profiles at any point in time to support the changing levels of intermittent generation. The
flexible, responsive and reliable characteristics of our biomass, gas, hydro and pumped storage generation assets
allow us to meet the continually increasing need for system support services arising from the increase in


5


-----

intermittent generation in the system both generally and at times of system strain, and play an important role in
the UK’s security of energy supply. The reduction in thermal generation capacity in the UK outlined above
means that there are fewer operators and plants available for the long term to provide such services, and even
fewer who can do so in a low carbon way that we are able to offer through our biomass units, hydro and pumped
storage assets.

Our pipeline of gas generation options will, if developed, enable us to provide additional system support
services further strengthens our position as a leading provider of such services. In addition, these options will be
able to provide various Ancillary Services and deliver further flexible generation in support of the UK electricity
system.

**_Our earnings benefit from a high degree of stability and visibility._**

Our earnings have a high degree of stability and visibility as a result of:

   - earnings from our biomass-fired generation units under the CfD Regime and RO Scheme (see below), the
latter of which allows us to flexibly optimise our generation across our RO-accredited units, reducing our
operational risk;

   - Capacity Market payments and Ancillary Services contracts for a range of our generation assets;

   - a naturally hedged portfolio of generation assets and businesses through the value chain;

   - a robust hedging policy; and

   - retail margins.

We expect our Adjusted EBITDA to continue to be derived predominantly from non-commodity exposed
sources of earnings in the future. As a consequence of this, the volatility of our earnings which characterised our
cash flows in previous years should be substantially reduced. We now have long-term visibility of our cash
flows, underpinned by a more diverse generation portfolio and operational flexibility.

_Long-term contracted Government revenues_

Generation from Drax Power Station’s existing biomass generation units benefits from a UK legislative and
contractual framework designed to support renewable energy sources. One of our biomass-fired generation units
receives support through the CfD Regime, while our other three biomass-fired generation units are supported
under the RO Scheme. Our support under both regimes extends to 2027. As a renewable fuel, biomass is exempt
from the EU ETS and Carbon Price Support.

Our CfD is a private law contract between Drax Power and a Government-owned entity, the Low Carbon
Contracts Company Limited. Under our CfD we are paid any shortfall, and repay any excess, between a strike
price and a market reference price calculated as the average market price for electricity in the UK market over a
given period. Our CfD is indexed to the UK consumer price index and extends to March 2027. It provides an
effective hedge against the electricity price at current market prices and thereby supports earnings stability and
visibility for our business.

The RO Scheme, established in 2002 to encourage the development of large-scale renewable electricity
capacity in the UK, places an obligation on licensed electricity suppliers either to source a proportion of the
electricity they provide to customers from eligible renewable sources or to make a payment equal to the buy-out
price. The buy-out price increases in line with UK retail price index each year. The sourcing of renewable energy
is demonstrated by the supplier presenting ROCs (equivalent in number to the supplier’s individual obligation) to
the administrator of the RO Scheme, Ofgem. ROCs are issued by Ofgem to renewable generators for each MWh
of renewable electricity generated in different proportions based on the type of technology used. Electricity
suppliers can source ROCs from renewable electricity generators. ROCs are tradable certificates with no fixed
price and therefore the amount an electricity supplier pays for a ROC is a matter for negotiation between the
supplier and generator. As a result of the RO Scheme, our Power Generation segment receives ROCs that, as a
vertically-integrated renewable energy generator, we can use in our B2B Energy Supply segment or sell to third
parties. A proportion of the underlying electricity produced by our ROC-accredited units is sold on a forward
basis in order to improve the stability and visibility of our cash flows.

We currently receive one ROC for each MWh of generation from three of our biomass-fired generation
units, on top of the purchase price for the sale of electricity produced. ROC support for two of these units is


6


-----

grandfathered by the Government at the level of one ROC for each MWh of generation until March 2027. Our
most recently converted biomass-fired generation unit does not benefit from grandfathering but is still eligible to
receive ROCs until March 2027. See “Industry Overview—UK Clean Energy Legislation—Grandfathering of
_support under the Renewables Obligation”._

The RO Scheme was changed in July 2018, enabling us to optimise generation across the RO-accredited
generation units of Drax Power Station (whether grandfathered or not) subject to an overall cap at the power
station level (see “Industry Overview—UK clean energy legislation—Grandfathering of support under the
_Renewables Obligation”). The flexibility afforded by the cap mitigates operational risks across our biomass-fired_
generation units, allowing us to increase generation in one unit to cater for unplanned outages in another, thereby
enabling us to deliver a more consistent earnings profile from biomass generation.

Our hydro facilities also receive support under the RO Scheme. We receive one ROC for each MWh of
generation at our Lanark hydro facility, and our Galloway hydro facility receives regulatory support from the RO
Scheme with respect to approximately 28MW of its 109MW generating capacity at a rate of one ROC for each
MWh of generation.

_Generation Capacity and System Support_

With increasing levels of intermittent generation, we are continuing to indentify opportunities to create value
from our ability to flexibly operate our generation assets according to prevailing market conditions, such as shortterm power and balancing market activity, the provision of Ancillary Services and the use of out-of-specification
fuels in our coal-fired generation assets. Our acquisition of ScottishPower’s 2.6GW portfolio of pumped storage,
hydro and gas-fired generation assets has further extended and diversified our flexibility of generation and ability to
provide Ancillary Services to support the UK electricity system. To capture value in this market we focus resources
on optimising availability and flexibility of our coal, biomass, gas, hydro and pumped storage generation assets.

The System Operator is required to balance supply and demand and to ensure the secure and stable operation
of the Transmission System. In addition to its operation of the Balancing Mechanism, it routinely contracts with
generators to provide system support services. We are able to provide Ancillary Services to the System Operator,
such as “frequency response” (altering output to ensure the frequency of electricity in the Transmission System is
within statutory limits) and “reactive power” (enabling the System Operator to manage the voltage profile of the
Transmission System within certain parameters) services and our newly-acquired assets extend the range of services
we can offer (such as Spin Gen from our Cruachan pumped storage power plant, which enables generation to
commence at short notice if required by the System Operator). We have a diverse portfolio of biomass, gas, pumped
storage and hydro generation units which are located across the UK that means we are well placed to offer a range
of Ancillary Services. We believe that the size and flexible characteristics of the generation assets we currently
operate are well suited to offer these services, providing an opportunity for further contract-based revenues. In
addition, we are developing a pipeline of options which would be well suited to provide these Ancillary Services to
further support the UK electricity system. These options include the repowering of the remaining two coal-fired
generation units at Drax Power Station to gas which, if both developed, would increase the installed capacity of
Drax Power Station to approximately 6.5GW; the development of up to four 299MW rapid-response OCGT
projects; and the opportunity to develop our Damhead Creek II site into a 1.8GW CCGT plant, each of which
options would also improve our ability to provide many of these services.

The UK has established a Capacity Market system to support security and reliability of supply for the end
consumer. The Capacity Market guarantees selected generators a fixed price for maintaining a specified generation
capacity for a given period of time through an auction system. Generators receive either a one-year Capacity Market
agreement or 15-year Capacity Market agreement depending on whether they are entering the auction for existing or
potential new plants, respectively. Existing plants requiring significant refurbishment may also be eligible for threeyear Capacity Market agreements. In November 2018, the General Court of the European Union imposed a
“standstill period” in respect of the Capacity Market while the European Commission completes a full “phase two”
state aid investigation into the Capacity Market. Payments to generators under existing Capacity Market agreements
and the holding of future capacity auctions have been suspended. Although there is no guarantee that the Capacity
Market will be reinstated, we expect that the Capacity Market will be re-established on the same or similar terms in
2019, consistent with the position expressed by the UK Government. However, in the event that it is not, the DGEL
Acquisition Agreement includes a risk-sharing mechanism whereby if any contracted Capacity Market payments for
the period from 1 January to 30 September 2019 are not received in respect of the DGEL Assets, then a further


7


-----

payment of up to £26 million would be made by either us to the previous shareholder of DGEL or vice-versa,
depending on DGEL’s 2019 gross profit. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—The
_Capacity Market in the UK is currently suspended and its future is uncertain” and “Summary—DGEL Acquisition”._

Subject to reinstatement of the Capacity Market, we also expect to be able to participate in future Capacity
Market auctions based on the capacity of our CCGT power stations, the Cruachan pumped storage power plant,
the Galloway hydro power plant and our coal units at Drax Power Station. We currently have index-linked
Capacity Market agreements for our two coal-fired generation units and the three small ancillary gas turbines
located at Drax Power Station, which are expected to result in contract-based revenues of approximately
£83 million between October 2018 to 30 September 2022 in aggregate, and similar agreements for certain of our
pumped storage, hydro and CCGT assets acquired in connection with the DGEL Acquisition, which are expected
to result in contract-based revenues in excess of £156 million in aggregate between October 2018 to
30 September 2022, in each case, subject to the re-establishment of the Capacity Market. To the extent that our
coal-fired generation units are converted to gas-fired generation, we expect that any conversion will only take
effect after our obligations under existing Capacity Market agreements (which currently run to 30 September
2022) have been fulfilled.

_A naturally hedged portfolio of generation assets and businesses through the value chain_

The DGEL Acquisition accelerated our development from a single-site generation business into a multi-site,
multi-technology operator. Our ability to generate using a range of different technologies with different dispatch
economics and provide a range of Ancillary Services means we are less exposed to risks inherent to single
technologies and movements in individual commodity prices. For example, at a generation level, a fall in gas
prices, which would typically cause wholesale electricity prices to decrease and reduce margins for our
generation from biomass, could be mitigated by an increase in gas-fired generation.

At an operational level, we trade our generation assets as a single portfolio, leveraging our established
expertise to optimise the running of our assets to maximise returns.

We operate an integrated value chain across our three core segments enabling us to optimise the timing and
delivery of pellets produced to meet our biomass generation requirements at Drax Power Station and in turn our
Generation Segment provides low-carbon and renewable electricity to our B2B Supply Segment for onward
supply to customers.

_Hedging policy_

The earnings of our Power Generation segment are further supported by our robust hedging policy under
which we sell electricity generated up to two years ahead. This allows us to secure a margin on such electricity at
times when bark spreads, clean spark spreads or dark green spreads are attractive, thereby increasing visibility
with respect to our future Power Generation segment earnings. As of 20 February 2019, we had contracted fixed
price power sales (including both forward sold electricity and gas proxy hedges) of approximately 16.3 TWh, 8.9
TWh and 3.4 TWh for delivery in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.

Our business is subject to risks due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, in particular, the weakening
of sterling relative to other operational currencies. Most of the biomass we purchase is priced in US dollars,
Canadian dollars or euro. We operate a robust hedging policy with a five-year hedging period to manage the risk
of a change in the relative values of the US dollar, Canadian dollar or euro, or relative to other currencies
(including the pound sterling), which may increase our suppliers’ cost of business and ultimately our cost of
goods sold with respect to biomass.

_Retail_

Opus enjoys good customer retention levels and the potential for further growth, for example by allowing
our Group to provide a dual fuel offering, while Haven Power is well established in the I&C market and is
seeking to increase its number of SME customers. Our B2B Energy Supply segment provides a broad offering in
the SME market, which is generally characterised by higher gross margins per MWh compared to the I&C
market. Our B2B Energy Supply segment provides a direct route into the market for a significant amount of the
electricity we generate and a significant proportion of the ROCs issued to us.

_Increased control over fuel input costs via an integrated biomass supply chain_

Our wood pellet manufacturing facilities have a combined annual nameplate capacity of 1,500,000 tonnes,
comprising capacity of 525,000 tonnes at each of our Amite and Morehouse facilities and 450,000 tonnes of
capacity at our LaSalle facility, which was fully commissioned ahead of schedule in 2018. Our US port facility in
Baton Rouge, Louisiana has an annual export capacity of 2,100,000 tonnes (with the scope to expand further to
3,000,000 tonnes) and exceeds our current self-supply, enabling us to consolidate supply from third parties to
drive further supply chain efficiencies. Our US operations are strategically located near one another for
operational efficiencies, including optimising the time and cost of wood pellet deliveries to our Baton Rouge port
facility.

In 2018, our wood pellet manufacturing facilities produced approximately 1,351,000 tonnes of wood pellets
and our US port facility shipped 1,582,000 tonnes of wood pellets to Drax Power Station. In 2018, wood pellets
manufactured at our own facilities accounted for 18.0 per cent. of the biomass used at Drax Power Station
(compared with 12.3 per cent. of self-supply in 2017 and 7.7 per cent. in 2016) with the balance sourced from
third party suppliers based in North America and Europe under a series of predominantly long-term contracts
from sources also certified as sustainable. We aim to increase the share of internally sourced pellets to up to
30 per cent. in the future. To further this aim, we are developing options to increase capacity at our LaSalle and
Morehouse facilities by 175,000 tonnes in aggregate by 2021.

Our ability to source an increasing proportion of our biomass requirements internally via self-supply allows
us to better manage the quality of feedstock and the timing of deliveries. This enables us to optimise generation
and reduce the risk of fuel shortages and supply chain issues curtailing generation from Drax Power Station and
to better ensure a stable cost of biomass, thus reducing exposure to commodity price fluctuations. At the same
time, we maintain the flexibility to participate in the biomass spot market when prices are attractive.

Our exposure to commodity prices is managed through a commercial hedging strategy, which seeks to enter
into forward sales of electricity and purchases of associated fuel and the carbon emissions allowances.
Additionally, to manage currency risks associated with our biomass purchase contracts, which are mainly in US
dollars, we actively hedge our position through a rolling five-year hedging strategy.

**_Strong financial metrics and conservative financial policies._**

We have a conservative financial policy and have maintained a low leverage since we listed on the London
Stock Exchange in December 2005.

Our reported net leverage at the end of the last three calendar years has been between 0.7x and 1.6x. After
the completion of the Opus Acquisition in February 2017, our consolidated pro forma net leverage as at
31 December 2016 only increased to 2.7x, decreasing to 1.6x by 31 December 2019; after the completion of the
DGEL Acquisition in December 2018, our consolidated pro forma net leverage as at 31 December 2018 was
3.1x, albeit we are targeting a reduction in net leverage to 2.0x by 31 December 2019. See “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Significant Factors affecting Results_
_of Operations” for a discussion of factors affecting comparability of 2016, 2017 and 2018. We are committed to_
maintaining leverage at a level that is consistent with our current crossover credit rating, which supports our
trading strategy.

We have a strong cash conversion profile with an average annual operating cash conversion for the last three
calendar years of over 133 per cent., reflecting our excellent financial discipline and ongoing low maintenance
capital expenditure requirements.

We announced a new dividend policy in June 2017, which will pay a sustainable and growing dividend
consistent with our commitment to a strong balance sheet and our ambitions for growth.

-----

We are focused on targeted selective investments which we expect to help us to continue to diversify our
earnings and cash flow sources within the framework of our conservative financial policy.

In addition to capital expenditure to secure operational performance, we expect our future maintenance
capital expenditures to include investments to upgrade our facilities to, among other things, comply with
applicable regulatory regimes, which we expect to translate into greater operating cash flow going forward. See
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Capital and
_Operating Expenditure”._

We have robust credit policies in place to limit the amount of concentration risk we have with any
counterparty (noting that the counterparty’s appetite to trade with us is itself based on its assessment of our credit
profile). Sales to the B2B Energy Supply segment (as opposed to third parties) further reduce our concentration
risk by spreading the Power Generation segment’s exposure to third-party credit risk across a wider customer
base.

**_Our proven pioneering management team has led our business through an evolving regulatory and_**
**_commodity market environment._**

We and our management team have proven experience in leading our business through an evolving
regulatory and commodity market environment and are complemented by a skilled operating team who are at the
forefront of biomass conversion technology, including the mechanical, engineering, electrical and civil works
required for such conversion. We have successfully transformed a pure coal generation business into a diversified
and vertically-integrated generator and supplier of flexible, low-carbon and renewable electricity. As a result of
this transformation, we are an industry-leader with extensive experience and operational knowledge of biomass
and its related supply chain logistics and are highly experienced in the successful delivery of large-scale
conversion of generation from coal. We have also gained significant experience in successfully integrating
businesses into our existing operations, putting us in a strong position to capitalise on our acquisition of Opus
and the DGEL Assets.

We believe the project to convert the first three of our generation units to biomass remains Europe’s largest
decarbonisation project, which was delivered on time and within budget. This experience enabled us to deliver
the low-cost conversion of a fourth biomass-fired generation unit in August 2018 and will position us to deliver
on our pipeline of options to convert either one or both of our two remaining coal-fired generation units to gas
generation, develop a 1.8GW CCGT plant at our Damhead Creek II site and/or develop our OCGT assets (in each
case, subject to a positive investment decision and appropriate support through the Capacity Market).

Our operational experience in handling biomass is also market-leading. We have developed innovative fuelhandling systems, logistics and storage solutions for biomass fuel as well as a bespoke technically-advanced
covered rail wagon with a specialised door design and a patented product flow control system to manage biomass
during discharge.

Further, we have developed an in-depth understanding of the scientific and technological effects of burning
a range of biomass fuels, as well as of the critical combustion characteristics of such fuels.

We have also put in place a biomass sustainability policy, which includes comprehensive carbon footprinting across our biomass supply chain, regular independent supplier audits and the use of third party
sustainability certification. All our biomass is procured in accordance with this sustainability policy.

**Strategy**

Our strategy is to deliver a stronger, more predictable, long-term financial performance for the Group along
with greater diversification in the markets in which we operate. By doing so, we seek to enable a zero-carbon,
lower-cost energy future.

**_Maintain stable earnings visibility by focusing on contractual revenue streams._**

Historically, the vast majority of the Group’s earnings were derived from the operation of Drax Power
Station as a merchant plant, selling wholesale power independently to third parties. Accordingly, the Group’s
earnings were volatile and exposed to commodity price or merchant risk. In recent years, the Group’s earnings
have diversified and the Group’s exposure to commodity price risk has substantially reduced.


10


-----

In the Power Generation segment, we intend to maintain our visibility of future earnings and cash flows
through the contracted earnings of Capacity Market and Ancillary Services payments. We expect this, combined
with the support we receive under the CfD Regime and RO Scheme, will result in a reduced level of commodity
markets exposure and increased stability and visibility of earnings.

We have secured index-linked Capacity Market agreements for our two coal-fired generation units and the
three small ancillary gas turbines located at Drax Power Station, which are expected to result in contract-based
revenues of approximately £83 million between October 2018 to 30 September 2022 in aggregate and similar
agreements for certain of our pumped storage, hydro and CCGT assets, which are expected to result in contractbased revenues in excess of £156 million in aggregate between October 2018 to 30 September 2022, in each
case, subject to the re-establishment of the Capacity Market.

We are developing a pipeline of options, which could include repowering the remaining two coal-fired
generation units at Drax Power Station to gas, leveraging expertise from prior conversions and using existing
infrastructure at Drax Power Station. If developed, each repowered unit will deliver stable, contract-based
earnings and extend the operating life of Drax Power Station through to the late 2030s whilst providing 1.8GW
of generation capacity. Our pipeline of options also includes further gas generation opportunities ranging from
developing our Damhead Creek II site into a 1.8GW CCGT power station to the development of up to four
299MW rapid-response OCGT plants. We believe that additional rapid response power plants will be required to
keep the UK’s electricity system stable in the future. If commissioned, our four new 299MW OCGT plants in
England and Wales will have the potential to provide fast, flexible gas generation to support the UK electricity
system at times of peak demand, will diversify our future energy generation capability and, subject to receipt of
appropriate support through the Capacity Market (if and when the Capacity Market is re-established), will
provide stable contract-based revenues. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—The
_Capacity Market in the UK is currently suspended and its future is uncertain”._

With increasing levels of intermittent generation, we are continuing to identify opportunities to create value
from our ability to flexibly operate our generation assets according to prevailing market conditions, such as
short-term power and balancing market activity, the provision of Ancillary Services and the increased margin
achieved from coal-fired generation due to the use of out-of-specification fuels. Our recent acquisition of
ScottishPower’s 2.6GW portfolio of assets significantly strengthens our offerings in this area and we focus
resources on optimising availability and flexibility of our coal, biomass, CCGT and pumped storage generation
assets to capture value in these markets. The flexible, dispatchable and responsive nature of our generation assets
positions us well to compete in the market and the development of our OCGT plants, our coal-to-gas conversion
project at Drax Power Station and our Damhead Creek II CCGT development project would further bolster our
offering in this market. With the changing grid dynamic, this market could grow significantly.

**_Profitably grow our B2B Energy Supply segment._**

One of our objectives is to increase the proportion of revenue and earnings generated by our B2B Energy
Supply segment by increasing our focus on the SME market, which generally has higher margins than the I&C
market, and by evaluating options for further margin enhancement, such as product alternatives and efficiency
enhancement.

We have a strong platform for growth in the B2B Energy Supply segment. Our B2B Energy Supply segment
is the fifth largest supplier of electricity to businesses in the UK by volume supplied as of 31 October 2018 and
the largest provider of renewable energy to businesses. As of 31 December 2018, we supplied over 396,000
electricity and gas meters and, in 2018, we supplied 17.9 TWh of electricity, of which 69 per cent. was from
renewable generation, representing an 11 per cent. share of the B2B electricity market. As the power system
transforms, we will be working closely with our customers to help them adapt to more decentralised and
decarbonised power. We consider this a significant opportunity for the Group in the medium and long term and
we expect our B2B Energy Supply segment to continue to deliver new products and services and enhanced
market coverage, driving market share growth across both the I&C and the SME markets.

**_Expand wood pellet self-supply and increase operational and supply chain efficiencies._**

Our target is to supply Drax Power Station with up to 30 per cent. of its annual demand for sustainable wood
pellets from our own production in the future. Our wood pellet manufacturing facilities supply all of their output
to Drax Power Station and supplied 18.0 per cent. of our internal requirements for generation from sustainable
biomass in 2018. We expect output to increase throughout 2019, following the successful commissioning in 2018


11


-----

of our third wood pellet manufacturing facility at LaSalle. All three of our wood pellet manufacturing facilities
have the capability to manufacture wood pellets at their nameplate capacity (a total of 1,500,000 tonnes). We are
developing options to increase capacity at our LaSalle and Morehouse facilities by 175,000 tonnes in aggregate
by 2021, which would represent a 13 per cent. increase on our current production capacity when the incremental
capacity is fully commissioned. Our wood pellet manufacturing facilities are strategically located close to one
another in the US Gulf region for operational and supply chain efficiencies. We intend to continue consolidating
supply from third parties at our Baton Rouge port facility to utilise unused export capacity and to drive further
supply chain efficiencies.

We have continued to identify opportunities to improve efficiencies in our supply chain. For example, we
are building and commissioning a new rail spur linking our LaSalle facility to the regional rail network and our
port facility at Baton Rouge, which will increase transportation efficiency and economies of scale and reduce the
cost and carbon footprint of our operations. We expect further efficiencies from our collaboration with Hunt
Forest Products, a biomass fibre supplier, which commissioned the construction of a sawmill next to our LaSalle
facility in January 2019. We anticipate this collaboration will reduce our raw material transport costs and overall
biomass cost.

More generally, we are actively focused on increasing the proportion of good quality wood pellets received
at Drax Power Station and reducing the amount of wood pellet degradation or “fines”. We have a number of
active internal workstreams to reduce fines and our progress on this front is a key focus for the Group.
Separately, we have a series of Group-wide initiatives to reduce the cost of our biomass supply chain with a view
to improving margins from biomass generation in the short term and positioning our Generation Segment to be
able to deliver profitable biomass generation without subsidy if no further subsidy regimes are put in place from
2027.

We further intend to optimise supply chain and logistics operations for our Power Generation segment, and
to utilise the flexibility of self-supply to manage production, to allow it to benefit from attractively priced
biomass cargoes in the spot market.

**_Continue to focus on operational excellence._**

We continually work to improve our performance across all segments. Having established ourselves as a
leader in managing sustainable biomass-based electricity generation across the entire value chain, we aim to
leverage this expertise to continue developing our business.

We continue to focus on engineering excellence and improving the efficiency and economic life through
investment in our asset base. For example, over the next three years we plan to continue to invest in replacing
and upgrading the high-pressure turbines in our biomass-fired units to improve efficiency, reduce maintenance
costs and increase unit flexibility. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operations—Results of Operations—Capital and Operating Expenditure”._

We are focused on improving the operational gains from our wood pellet manufacturing facilities,
responding to planned and unplanned events at Drax Power Station through seamless teamwork to maintain high
availability and ensuring an excellent standard of customer service at our B2B Energy Supply segment. Safety
and sustainability remain at the centre of our operational philosophy, recognising that excellent safety
performance at our generating assets and our wood pellet manufacturing facilities drives efficiency and improves
the productivity of our assets, and we are a consistent top quartile performer for safety performance. All of our
biomass is procured in line with our industry-leading sustainability criteria, ensuring that the wood pellets we use
for electricity generation are sustainable and low carbon.

**DGEL Acquisition**

On 31 December 2018, we acquired ScottishPower’s multi-site, multi-technology power generation
business, a 2.6GW portfolio of pumped storage, hydro and gas-fired power generation assets (renamed Drax
Generation Enterprise Limited). The assets acquired in connection with the DGEL Acquisition include Cruachan
power plant, one of only four pumped storage assets in the UK, hydro assets in Lanark and Galloway, and gasfired Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (“CCGT”) power stations at Damhead Creek, Rye House and Shoreham in
the south of England and Blackburn Mill in the North. DGEL also owns SMW, a company operating a biomassfrom-waste facility on the outskirts of Glasgow.

The initial consideration payable was £687 million, based on total consideration of £702 million less
customary net debt and working capital adjustments. The initial consideration due to the vendor on 2 January
2019 was paid using a combination of £550 million drawn under the 2018 Bridge Facility and £137 million of
cash reserves.

The DGEL Acquisition Agreement includes a risk-sharing compensation mechanism in respect of Capacity
Market payments for the period 1 January 2019 to 30 September 2019 for the DGEL Assets with Capacity
Market agreements. If less than 100 per cent. of these Capacity Market payments are received and the gross
profit of the DGEL Group for 2019 is lower than expected, Drax will receive a payment from the vendor of up to
£26 million. The mechanism may also require us to make a payment to the vendor of up to £26 million if less
than 100 per cent. of these Capacity Market payments are received but the DGEL Group performs better than
expected in 2019. Under these arrangements, if less than 100 per cent. of these capacity payments are received:

    - the vendor will make a payment to Drax if the 2019 Gross Profit (as defined in the DGEL
Acquisition Agreement) is less than £155 million. The payment will be an amount equal to 72 per
cent. of any shortfall in the 2019 Gross Profit below £155 million. The amount of the payment is
capped at the lower of the amount in respect of Capacity Market payments due in respect of the
DGEL Assets but not received and £26 million; and

    - Drax will make a payment to the vendor if the 2019 Gross Profit is more than £165 million. The
payment will be an amount equal to 72 per cent. of any amount by which the 2019 Gross Profit
exceeds £165 million. The amount of the payment is capped at the lower of the amount in respect of
Capacity Market payments due in respect of the DGEL Assets but not received by Drax and
£26 million.

If subsequently Drax receives any Capacity Market payments in respect of the period 1 January 2019 to
30 September 2019, Drax will pay 72 per cent. of those amounts to the vendor capped at the amount paid by the
vendor to Drax under the mechanism above. Any payments pursuant to these arrangements will be cash
adjustments to the acquisition consideration and not included in our Adjusted EBITDA.

For further information on the Capacity Market, see “Industry Overview—Overview of Electricity Market
_Reform—Capacity Market” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating To Our Business And Industry—The Capacity_
_Market in the UK is currently suspended and its future is uncertain”._

The DGEL Acquisition Agreement contains limitations on the liability of the previous shareholder,
including time limits and financial caps.

as the New Notes.

(5) On 26 April 2018, the Issuer issued $300 million aggregate amount of 6 [5]⁄8% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (the “Initial Notes” and,
together with the New Notes, the “Notes”). The Initial Notes were issued pursuant to the Indenture. The Initial Notes are guaranteed on
a senior secured basis by the Guarantors and are secured by the same Collateral as the New Notes.

(6) On 21 April 2017, with effect from 5 May 2017, we amended and restated a revolving credit facility agreement originally entered into
on 20 December 2012, as amended and restated on 8 December 2015, between, among others, Drax Power, Barclays Bank PLC as
facility agent and Drax Corporate Limited and its subsidiaries as guarantors, pursuant to an amendment and restatement agreement (the
“Senior Facilities Agreement”). The Senior Facilities Agreement comprises a £315 million committed multicurrency revolving credit
facility and a drawn £35 million term facility (the “Senior Facilities”). The original borrower under the Senior Facilities Agreement is
Drax Corporate Limited. The Senior Facilities are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Guarantors (other than Drax Corporate
Limited) and the Issuer and are secured by the same Collateral that secures the 2018 Bridge Facility, the 2022 Notes and the Initial
Notes and that will secure the New Notes. In the event of enforcement or certain distressed disposals, any liabilities in respect of
obligations under the Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations (including under the Secured Trading Line) and liabilities to
lenders or creditors under certain other indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the Indenture and the 2022 Indenture (subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement) and then outstanding will receive priority in relation to any proceeds received from the Collateral. Please see
“Description of Notes—Security”. For more information on the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement, please see “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Facilities Agreement”._

(7) We entered into an acquisition bridge facility agreement on 16 October 2018 between, among others, Drax Corporate Limited as

**Facility Agreement”). The 2018 Bridge Facility Agreement comprises a £725 million committed acquisition facility, including,**
without limitation, a certain funds facility for the purposes of the DGEL Acquisition (the “2018 Bridge Facility”). On 2 January 2019,
Drax Corporate Limited drew down £550 million under the 2018 Bridge Facility and all remaining commitments have been cancelled.
The 2018 Bridge Facility is guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Guarantors, which is the borrower under the 2018 Bridge
Facility) and the Issuer and are secured by the same Collateral that secures the Senior Facilities, the 2022 Notes and the Initial Notes
and that will secure the New Notes. We plan to use the proceeds from the Offering of the Notes to repay £154.1 million (assuming an
issuance at par) of the principal amount outstanding under the 2018 Bridge Facility. Following the Offering, we expect to refinance the
remaining portion of indebtedness under the 2018 Bridge Facility Agreement during 2019. See “Capitalisation”. For more information
on the terms of the 2018 Bridge Facility Agreement, please see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—2018 Bridge
_Facility”._

(8) Drax Power has entered into ISDA master agreements with a number of financial institutions (the “STL Counterparties”) with whom
Drax Power can trade UK power, dark green spreads and gas on a senior secured basis without the requirement for Drax Power to post
collateral (the “Secured Trading Line”). Under the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement, the potential future exposure under the
Secured Trading Line for each combination of tradable products must be less than £200 million, as determined each time Drax Power
seeks to add an additional season to the Secured Trading Line. The STL Counterparties benefit from the same Collateral as the 2018
Bridge Facility, the 2022 Notes, the Initial Notes and the Senior Facilities, and such Collateral will also secure the New Notes and the
Guarantees. In the event of enforcement or certain distressed disposals, any liabilities in respect of obligations under the Senior
Facilities and certain hedging obligations (including under the Secured Trading Line and the currency, interest rate and inflation
hedging referred to below) and liabilities to lenders or creditors under certain other indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the
Indenture and the 2022 Indenture (subject to the Intercreditor Agreement) and then outstanding will receive priority in relation to any
proceeds of certain distressed disposals or enforcement of the Collateral. Please see “Description of Notes—Security”. In addition, Drax
Power has the ability to enter into currency, interest rate and inflation rate hedging arrangements on a senior secured basis, with such
counterparties also benefiting from the same Collateral as referred to above. Such hedging arrangements may, in the future, also be
entered into by other members of the Group. These arrangements are in addition to any commodities and/or currency and interest rate
trading that the Group undertakes on an unsecured basis. For more information on the terms of these arrangements, please see
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Secured Trading Line and Hedging”.

(9) Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of an enforcement of the security interests over the Collateral and certain
distressed disposals, the holders of the New Notes will receive proceeds from such Collateral pari passu with the holders of the 2022
Notes and the Initial Notes and with the lenders under the 2018 Bridge Facility and only after the lenders under the Senior Facilities
Agreement, counterparties to certain hedging agreements (including under the Secured Trading Line) and lenders or creditors under
certain other indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the Indenture and the 2022 Indenture (subject to the Intercreditor Agreement)

obligations of the Issuer that are not expressly subordinated in right
of payment to the New Notes, including the obligations of the
Issuer under the 2022 Notes, the Initial Notes, Indebtedness
Incurred under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the 2018 Bridge
Facility Agreement and certain hedging obligations (including the
obligations under the Secured Trading Line);


17


-----

                      - be senior in right of payment to all existing and future obligations
of the Issuer that are expressly subordinated in right of payment to
the New Notes;

                     - be secured by the Collateral on and from the Issue Date, but the
Holders of the New Notes will only receive proceeds from the
enforcement over the Collateral and certain distressed disposals
after certain obligations of DGHL and its Subsidiaries, including
the Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities Agreement and certain
hedging obligations (including the obligations under the Secured
Trading Line), have been repaid and discharged in full;

                      - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future obligations of
the Issuer that are secured by property or assets that do not secure
the New Notes, to the extent of the value of the property and assets
securing such obligations; and

                      - be structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations of
the non-Guarantor Subsidiaries of DGHL.

**Guarantees . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The New Notes will be guaranteed on a senior basis by DGHL, Drax
Corporate Limited, Drax Smart Generation Holdco Limited, Drax
Fuel Supply Limited, Drax Power, Drax Smart Supply Holdco
Limited, Haven Power, Haven Heat Limited, Drax Retail
Developments Limited, Opus, Opus Energy Limited, Abbott Debt
Recovery Limited, Opus Energy (Corporate) Limited, Opus Gas
Supply Limited, Opus Energy Renewables Limited, Farmoor Energy
Limited, Donnington Energy Limited, Drax Research, Drax Corporate
Developments Limited, Drax Innovation Limited, Drax Smart

BioEnergy LLC, Drax Biomass International Holdings LLC, Drax
Biomass Holdings LLC, Drax Biomass Inc., Baton Rouge Transit
LLC, DBI O&M Company LLC, Amite BioEnergy LLC, Tyler
BioEnergy LLC, Jefferson Transit LLC, LaSalle BioEnergy LLC and
DGEL (collectively, the “Guarantors”).

For the year ended 31 December 2018, the Guarantors (other than
DGEL) generated Adjusted EBITDA of £257.1 million, representing
103 per cent. of the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA. As of 31 December
2018, the total assets of the Guarantors (including DGEL) were
£4,262.7 million (excluding goodwill), representing 99 per cent. of
the Group’s total assets (excluding goodwill).

After giving pro forma effect to the Transactions as if they had
occurred on 31 December 2018, DGHL and its Restricted
Subsidiaries would have had £1,175.7 million of borrowings
outstanding, including £156.9 million (assuming an issuance at par)
under the New Notes (being the pound sterling equivalent of $200
million, converted at a rate of $1.2751 to £1.00, which was the market
rate on 31 December 2018, sourced from Reuters, used for the
preparation of its balance sheet contained in the 2018 Drax Group
Audited Financial Statements). The Guarantees of the Guarantors
may be released as set forth under “Description of Notes—Note
_Guarantees—Releases of Notes Guarantees”._

As of 31 December 2018, on an as adjusted basis giving effect to the
Transactions as described under “Summary—The Financing” and
“Use of Proceeds”, DGHL’s subsidiaries that will not guarantee the
New Notes would have had no outstanding third party indebtedness.

The validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the liability of
each Guarantor is subject to the limitations described in “Certain
_Insolvency_ _Considerations_ _and_ _Limitations_ _on_ _Validity_ _and_
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security”. The Guarantees may_
be released under certain circumstances. See “Description of Notes—
_Note Guarantees—Releases of Note Guarantees”._

**Ranking of the Guarantees . . . . . . . . . .** The Note Guarantee of each Guarantor will be a general, joint and
several, senior obligation of that Guarantor and will:

                     - rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future
obligations of that Guarantor that are not expressly subordinated in
right of payment to such Note Guarantee, including the guarantees
in respect of the 2022 Notes and the Initial Notes, Indebtedness
Incurred under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the 2018 Bridge
Facility Agreement and certain hedging obligations (including the
obligations under the Secured Trading Line);

                      - rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future obligations
of such Guarantor that are expressly subordinated in right of
payment to such Note Guarantee;

                    - (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) be secured by the
Collateral as set forth under “Description of the Notes—Security”,
but the Holders of the New Notes will only receive proceeds from
the enforcement over the Collateral and certain distressed disposals
after certain obligations of DGHL and its Subsidiaries, including
the Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities Agreement and certain
hedging obligations (including the obligations under the Secured
Trading Line), have been repaid and discharged in full;

                      - be structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations of
any Subsidiaries of DGHL that are not Guarantors or the Issuer;
and

                      - be effectively subordinated to all existing and future obligations of
such Guarantor that are secured by property or assets that do not
secure such Note Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the
property and assets securing such obligations.

**Collateral . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** On the Issue Date, the New Notes and the Note Guarantees will
(subject to the Agreed Security Principles) be secured by first-ranking
security interests over the following:

                    - all of the issued share capital of DGHL and certain receivables
owed to Drax Group plc by DGHL;

                       - substantially all of the assets of the Issuer, including the receivables
owed to the Issuer in respect of the New Proceeds Loan pursuant to
which the proceeds of the New Notes are on-lent;

                     - all of the issued share capital of the Issuer and each Subsidiary
Guarantor;

                     - substantially all of the assets of each Guarantor incorporated or
organised under the laws of England and Wales; and

                     - substantially all of the assets of each Guarantor organised in or
under the laws of the United States (or any state or territory thereof
or the District of Columbia) other than any real property located in
the United States; and

                     - substantially all of the assets of the Guarantor incorporated or
organised under the laws of Scotland,


19


-----

(together, the “Collateral”).

The Collateral securing the New Notes and the Guarantees also
secures the Senior Facilities, the 2022 Notes, the Initial Notes, the
2018 Bridge Facility and certain hedging obligations (including the
obligations under the Secured Trading Line). Under the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of enforcement of the security
interests over the Collateral and certain distressed disposals, the
holders of the New Notes will receive proceeds from such Collateral
_pari passu with the holders of the 2022 Notes, the Initial Notes and_
with the lenders under the 2018 Bridge Facility and only after the
lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement, counterparties to
certain hedging agreements (including counterparties under the
Secured Trading Line) and lenders or creditors under certain other
indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the Indenture and the
2022 Indenture (subject to the Intercreditor Agreement) and then
outstanding have been repaid in full.

The Issuer’s obligations in respect of the New Notes and the
Guarantors’ obligations in respect of the Guarantees may be released
in certain circumstances. In addition, the security interests in the
Collateral may be released under certain circumstances. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees, and Our_
_Capital_ _Structure”,_ “Description _of_ _Certain_ _Financing_
_Arrangements—Intercreditor_ _Agreement”,_ and “Description _of_
_Notes—Security”,_ “Description _of_ _Notes—Certain_ _Covenants—_
_Additional Guarantees” and “Description of Notes—Satisfaction and_
_Discharge”._

**Intercreditor Agreement . . . . . . . . . . . .** Each holder of a New Note by accepting a New Note will be deemed
to have agreed to, and be bound by, the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement. The Indenture is subject to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, and the rights and benefits of the holders of the Notes
will be limited accordingly and subject to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”._

**Optional Redemption: . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes at any time on or after
1 May 2021 at the redemption prices as described under “Description
_of Notes—Optional Redemption” plus accrued and unpaid interest and_
Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the redemption
date. At any time prior to 1 May 2021, the Issuer may redeem all or,
from time to time, part of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100
per cent. of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the applicable
redemption dates plus the applicable “make whole” premium set forth
in “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption”.

At any time prior to 1 May 2021, the Issuer may redeem up to 40 per
cent. of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including the
original principal amount of any Additional Notes issued after the
Issue Date) with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at
a redemption price equal to 106.625 per cent. of the principal amount
of the Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the redemption
date; provided that at least 50 per cent. of the original aggregate
principal amount of the Notes (including the original principal
amount of any Additional Notes) remain outstanding after such
redemption.


20


-----

In connection with any tender offer or other offer to purchase all of
the Notes, if holders of not less than 90 per cent. of the aggregate
principal amount of the then outstanding Notes validly tender and do
not validly withdraw such Notes in such tender offer or offer to
purchase, the Issuer will have the right to redeem all Notes that
remain outstanding at a price equivalent to the highest price paid
pursuant to such tender offer or offer to purchase (excluding any early
tender premium). See “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption
_upon Certain Tender Offers”._

**Additional Amounts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Except as provided in “Description of Notes”, all payments made by
or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor in respect of the Notes or
the Guarantees will be made without withholding or deduction for
any taxes or other governmental charges, except to the extent required
by law. If any such withholding or deduction is required by law in any
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined under “Description of
_Notes—Withholding Taxes”), subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer_
or the relevant Guarantor, as appropriate, will pay additional amounts
so that the net amount received is no less than would have been
received in the absence of such withholding or deduction. See
“Description of Notes—Withholding Taxes”.

**Tax Redemption . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any
time upon giving proper notice if certain changes in the tax law of any
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction become effective that would impose
withholding or deduction for taxes on amounts payable on the Notes
or the Guarantees, as applicable, in respect of which the relevant
payor would be required to pay Additional Amounts, such redemption
being at a redemption price of 100 per cent. of the principal amount,
plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to
the redemption date. See “Description of Notes—Redemption for
_Taxation Reasons”._

**Change of Control . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a “change of
control”, the Issuer is required to offer to repurchase all outstanding
Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101 per cent. of the
aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest
and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of
purchase. See “Description of Notes—Change of Control”.

**Certain Covenants . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Indenture restricts the ability of DGHL and the restricted
subsidiaries of DGHL to:

                   - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain
preferred stock;

                     - pay dividends on, or redeem, capital stock and make certain other
restricted payments;

                     - make certain investments;

                       - create or permit to exist certain liens;

                       - sell, lease or transfer certain assets, including subsidiary stock;

                       - engage in certain activities (with respect to the Issuer);


21


-----

                    - make certain amendments to the Proceeds Loans; and

                      - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the
Notes.

Certain of the covenants will be suspended if the Notes obtain and
maintain an investment-grade rating. Each of these covenants is
subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description
_of Notes—Certain Covenants”._

**Use of Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Group will use the gross proceeds of the Offering to (i) partially
repay indebtedness under the 2018 Bridge Facility Agreement and (ii)
pay estimated fees and expenses of the Offering and partial
repayment of the 2018 Bridge Facility, including underwriting fees
and commissions, professional fees and other associated transaction
costs as well as applicable prepayment fees and accrued and unpaid
interest to the date of repayment. See “Use of Proceeds”.

**Transfer Restrictions . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The New Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and will not be,
registered under the US Securities Act or the securities laws of any
other jurisdiction. The New Notes are subject to restrictions on
transferability and resale. See “Notice to Investors”. The Issuer has
not agreed to, or otherwise undertaken to, register the New Notes or
the Guarantees under the securities laws in any jurisdiction (including
by way of an exchange offer) and does not intend to do so.

**No Established Market for the New**
**Notes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The New Notes will be new securities for which there is currently no
established trading market. Although the Initial Purchasers have
advised the Issuer that they intend to make a market for the New
Notes, they are not obligated to do so and they may discontinue
market making at any time without notice. Accordingly, there can be
no assurances as to the development or liquidity of any market for the
New Notes.

**SUMMARY HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL AND OTHER DATA**

The Issuer is a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales on 10 March
2017, and is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of DGHL, which is in turn a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of
Drax Group plc. The Issuer is a finance company that conducts no business operations of its own and as of the
Issue Date its only material assets will be its rights and claims under various intercompany financings (including
under the New Proceeds Loan, the 2022 Notes Proceeds Loan and the Initial Notes Proceeds Loan) and its only
material liabilities will be its outstanding indebtedness (including its obligations under the New Notes, the Intial
Notes and the 2022 Notes and its guarantees in respect of the Senior Facilities Agreement, the 2018 Bridge
Facility Agreement and certain hedging obligations (including the Secured Trading Line)). For further
information, please see “Summary—Corporate and Financing Structure”, “Our Business” and “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements”._

Unless otherwise indicated, this Offering Memorandum does not include any historical financial
information relating to the Issuer.

This Offering Memorandum presents consolidated financial information for the Group on the level of Drax
Group plc, the immediate holding company of DGHL. Drax Group plc will not be subject to the restrictive
covenants under the Indenture, will not provide a Guarantee in favour of the Notes and will not grant security in
favour of the Notes, except with respect to the shares it owns in DGHL and certain receivables owed to Drax
Group plc by members of the Group. Drax Group plc is a holding company and as at 31 December 2018 its only
material assets and liabilities were its interest in the issued and outstanding shares of DGHL, its rights and
obligations under the Shareholder Support Agreement, a net intercompany liability (including the balance of
intercompany liabilities and intercompany receivables) of £11.7 million and cash of £1.7 million.

The following tables present summary historical consolidated financial data for Drax Group plc as at and for
the years ended 31 December 2016, 2017 and 2018. Unless otherwise specified, the summary historical
consolidated financial data of Drax Group plc as of and for the years ended 31 December 2016, 2017 and 2018
has been derived from the Drax Group Audited Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum. The financial information of the Group as of and for the year ended 31 December 2018
(i) includes the assets and liabilities of the DGEL Group acquired in connection with the DGEL Acquisition in
the Drax Group’s balance sheet as of 31 December 2018 and (ii) does not include income, expenditure or cash
flows of the DGEL Group. The Drax Group Audited Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”).

As discussed in Note 8.3 to the 2018 Drax Group Audited Financial Statements, the Group’s audited
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended 31 December 2018 are not directly comparable
with the Group’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended 31 December 2016 and
2017, due to (i) the adoption of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which took effect as of 1 January 2018, and (ii) the
change in presentation of the Group’s consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 December 2018 to
include unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts in the line item to which they relate (revenue or cost
of sales, as applicable), instead of in a separate line item below gross profit. The unaudited comparative
information as of and for the year ended 31 December 2017 included in the Group’s audited consolidated
financial statements as of and for the year ended 31 December 2018 has been restated in order to give effect to
the adoption of IFRS 9 as if it had occurred on 1 January 2017 and has been re-presented to reflect the change in
presentation of unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts. Financial information derived from such
unaudited comparative information as of and for the year ended 31 December 2017 is presented as “restated” in
the below tables and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. In this Offering Memorandum, we present
financial information for the year ended 31 December 2017 on a restated and non-restated basis. Additionally,
comparative financial information for the year ended 31 December 2016 has not been restated or re-presented in
accordance with the aforementioned changes in accounting policy and income statement presentation,
respectively, which may affect the comparability of results on a year-to-year basis for the historical results of
operations included in this Offering Memorandum and future periods with historical results of operations.

The financial information below includes certain Non-IFRS Measures used to evaluate the Group’s
economic and financial performance. These measures are not identified as accounting measures under IFRS and
therefore should not be considered as an alternative measure to evaluate the Group’s performance. See
“Presentation of Financial Information and Other Information—Non-IFRS Financial Measures”. The financial
information below is not necessarily indicative of future results of operations. Prospective investors should read

the summary data presented below in conjunction with “Use of Proceeds”, “Capitalisation”, “Selected Financial
_Information”, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and_
the Drax Group Audited Financial Statements for 2016, 2017 and 2018 and the related notes thereto, which are
included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

The financial information presented below includes certain unaudited financial information, presented on an
_as adjusted basis to give effect to the Transactions. The unaudited as adjusted financial information is for_
illustrative purposes only and is not intended to represent or to be indicative of the consolidated results of
operations or financial position the Group would have reported had (i) the Transactions been completed as of
1 January 2018 for the purposes of the calculation of as adjusted interest expense or (ii) the Transactions been
completed as of 31 December 2018 for the purposes of the calculation of as adjusted cash and cash equivalents,
_as adjusted consolidated debt and as adjusted consolidated net debt. The unaudited as adjusted financial_
information should not be taken as indicative of the Group’s future consolidated results of operations or financial
position.

The as adjusted financial data has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X
under the US Securities Act, the Prospectus Directive or IFRS, US GAAP or any other generally accepted
accounting standards. Neither the assumptions underlying the as adjusted adjustments nor the resulting as
_adjusted financial data have been audited or reviewed._

(1) For the years ended 31 December 2017 (restated) and 2018, our revenue and cost of sales includes certain remeasurements on
derivative contracts which cannot be designated as hedging instruments under IFRS which comprise gains or losses on derivative
contracts to the extent that those contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, or hedge accounting is not effective, and those gains or
losses are either (i) unrealised and relate to the delivery of commodity contracts in future periods, or (ii) are realised in relation to the
delivery of commodity contracts in the current period. The effect of excluding certain remeasurements from results of operations is to
reflect commodity sales and purchases at contracted prices—i.e. at the all-in-hedged amount paid or received in respect of the delivery
of the commodity in question. For the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2017, unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts are
included as a separate line item below gross profit.

(2) We define Adjusted EBITDA as profit/loss for the year before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and certain material items that do
not reflect the underlying trading performance of the business. Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended 31 December 2017 (both as
restated and prior to restatement) and 2018 does not exclude the receipt of £8.0 million and £16.9 million of insurance proceeds
primarily recognised within cost of sales, respectively, in respect of insurance claims, including claims for loss of generation from our
biomass units from 2016 through 2018. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation
or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported under IFRS. See “Presentation of Financial Information and Other
_Information—Non-IFRS Financial Measures” for more information. A reconciliation from profit/loss for the year to Adjusted EBITDA_
is presented below:

(a) Represents the sum of the Acquired Revenue of DGEL (which excludes revenue attributable to assets not acquired by the Group)
and the revenue of its sole subsidiary, SMW, for the year ended 31 December 2018, sourced from unaudited management
accounts of DGEL and SMW, respectively. The Drax Group Audited Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum do not reflect the Acquired Revenue of the DGEL Group and such measure has not been audited, reviewed or
verified by an independent accounting firm and is preliminary and subject to change. See “Presentation of Financial Information
_and Other Information”_

(2) We define Adjusted EBITDA as profit/loss for the year before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and certain material items that do
not reflect the underlying trading performance of the business. Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended 31 December 2017 (both as
restated and prior to restatement) and 2018 does not exclude the receipt of £8.0 million and £16.9 million of insurance proceeds
primarily recognised within cost of sales, respectively, in respect of insurance claims, including claims for loss of generation from our
biomass units from 2016 through 2018. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted to include the Adjusted
EBITDA of the DGEL Group for the year ended 31 December 2018. In calculating the Adjusted EBITDA of the DGEL Group, we
made certain assumptions our management believes to be reasonable. These adjustments are based upon forecasts and estimates and are
in part based upon historical information of the acquired entities that was prepared by management of the entities before they were
acquired and which cannot be independently verified by our management. Our synergy and cost savings estimates are based upon a
number of expectations and assumptions, which may prove to be incorrect. As such, the actual results for the DGEL Group may differ
and any anticipated cost savings may not be achieved to the extent and within the time frame anticipated, if at all, and we may be
required to expend more funds in respect of these synergies than we currently anticipate. There can be no assurance these assumptions
are correct, and the measure of Adjusted EBITDA of the DGEL Group presented herein is therefore inherently subject to risks and
uncertainties. Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of financial performance under IFRS and
should not be considered as alternatives to profit or any other performance measure derived in accordance with IFRS. We present
Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for informational purposes only. This information does not represent the
Adjusted EBITDA we would have achieved had the DGEL Group formed part of the Group from 1 January 2018 or a projection of
future Adjusted EBITDA. It may not give an accurate or complete picture of the results of operations and should not be relied upon
when making an investment decision. See “Presentation of Financial Information and Other Information—Non-IFRS Financial
_Measures” and “Presentation of Financial Information and Other Information—DGEL Group Financial Information and Pro Forma_
_Financial Information” for more information. Adjusted EBITDA is affected by a number of factors, including availability of our_
generation units, electricity wholesale prices, seasonality and the level of our operating expense. See “Management’s Discussion and
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Significant Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations” for a description_
of certain significant factors that are expected to have an impact on our Adjusted EBITDA going forward. Reconciliations from, (i) with
respect to the year ended 31 December and 2018, profit for the year to Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, and
(ii) with respect to the years ended 31 December 2016, 2017 and 2017 (restated), profit for the year to Adjusted EBITDA, are presented

(a) Beginning in 2018, we include the cost of debt restructure, which comprises costs associated with the refinancing of our debt,
within interest payable and other similar charges. The years ended 31 December 2016 and 2017 have been re-presented to
conform to this presentation. Cost of debt restructure was £nil, £24.2 million and £7.2 million in the years ended 31 December
2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively.

Beginning in 2017, we separated foreign exchange gains and losses from interest payable and similar charges. The year ended
31 December 2016 has been re-presented to conform to this presentation, consistent with Note 2.5 to the 2017 Drax Group
Audited Financial Statements.

(b) Represents asset obsolescence charges relating to coal-specific assets written-off following the conversion of the fourth unit at
Drax Power Station to run on biomass.

(c) Represents the loss realised on the disposal of multiple immaterial assets compared to the book value of the respective assets. For
the year ended 31 December 2017, also represents the loss realised on the disposal of assets related to Billington Bioenergy
(£3.6 million).

(d) For the year ended 31 December 2018, represents costs associated with the acquisition and integration of DGEL into the Group
(£21.0 million), closure of our Atlanta, Georgia office to relocate the US head office to Monroe, Louisiana (£3.7 million) and
certain restructuring costs in our B2B business (£3.0 million). For the year ended 31 December 2017, represents the costs
associated with the acquisition and integration of Opus into the Group. In the years 2016 and 2017, this line item was previously
defined as “Acquisition-related costs”.

(e) For the year ended 31 December 2018, represents a credit relating to contingent consideration in connection with our OCGT
projects. For the year ended 31 December 2017, represents unrealised losses on the equity investment in Aggregated Micro
Power Holdings Plc (£0.2 million) as well as a charge relating to contingent consideration payable in connection with our OCGT
projects (£0.2 million).

(f) For an explanation of certain remeasurements, please see footnote (1) above under the caption “—Summary Historical Financial
_and Other Information”._

(g) Adjusted EBITDA of the DGEL Group represents the sum of the Adjusted EBITDA of DGEL and the EBITDA of its sole
subsidiary, SMW, for the year ended 31 December 2018, sourced from unaudited management accounts of DGEL and SMW,
respectively. EBITDA in respect of DGEL and SMW means profit/loss for the year before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortisation. For the year ended 31 December 2018, Adjusted EBITDA in respect of DGEL means profit/loss for the year before
interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, excluding the effect of (i) EBITDA attributable to assets not acquired by the Group,
(ii) the impact of a one-off stamp duty charge recognised as a result of the DGEL Acquisition and (iii) the Group’s estimate of
central overhead costs that would not have been incurred by DGEL had it been owned by the Group. For the year ended
31 December 2018, no further adjustments were made with respect to SMW’s EBITDA to calculate the Adjusted EBITDA of the
DGEL Group. In calculating the Adjusted EBITDA of DGEL, we made certain assumptions our management believes to be
reasonable. The Drax Group Audited Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum do not reflect the
Adjusted EBITDA of the DGEL Group and such measure has not been audited, reviewed or verified by an independent
accounting firm and is preliminary and subject to change. See “Presentation of Financial Information and Other Information”. A

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the New Notes involves risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below as_
_well as the other information contained in this Offering Memorandum before making an investment decision. Any_
_of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations,_
_and as a result you may lose all or part of your original investment. The risks described below are not the only_
_risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be_
_immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations which,_
_in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to pay interest and repay the principal_
_amount in respect of the New Notes._

_Except as the context otherwise indicates and as discussed in the next sentence, when discussing historical_
_financial or operating information in this section “we”, “us”, “our”, “Drax Group” and “Drax,” are generally_
_used to refer to the business of the Drax Group plc and its subsidiaries, excluding the DGEL Group. The assets_
_and liabilities of the DGEL Group have been included in the consolidated balance sheet of the Drax Group_
_Audited Financial Statements at 31 December 2018, and when discussing any balance sheet information of the_
_Drax Group plc as at 31 December 2018, “we”, “us”, “our”, “Drax Group” and “Drax,” are generally used to_
_refer to the business of the Drax Group plc and its subsidiaries, including the DGEL Group._

This Offering Memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in those forward-looking statements as a result of
various factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. See “Forward_Looking Statements”._

**RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY**

**_The reduction or abandonment of governmental support for generation of electricity from biomass or other_**
**_forms of renewable generation or other relevant changes in governmental energy policy may materially_**
**_adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition and results of operations._**

The development of renewable energy sources, including biomass, and the generation of renewable energy
in the UK relies, in large part, on regulatory and financial support of the Government. Any changes to these
policies have, in the past, materially affected, and may in the future materially affect our existing business, as
support mechanisms, in particular the RO Scheme and the CfD Regime, are essential to the viability of our
business.

Changes in the laws and policies of the UK and the EU have a direct impact on our development and future
regime operations, as our generation and electricity supply businesses are based solely in the UK. For example,
in January 2019 the Government reaffirmed its intension to phase out unabated electricity generation from coal
by 2025. The UK is currently required by the Renewable Energy Directive (2009/28/EC) (the “Renewable
**Energy Directive”) to procure 15 per cent. of the UK’s energy demand from renewable sources by 2020. In**
December 2018, the Recast Renewable Energy Directive ((EU) 2018/2001) (“RED II”) came into force,
introducing a binding EU-level target for a minimum 32 per cent. share of energy from renewable sources in
gross final consumption of energy by 2030 and including a review clause for a potential upwards revision of the
target by 2023. To meet the 2030 target, EU Member States are asked to set their own national targets. The
Government has also set carbon emissions targets for the UK pursuant to the Climate Change Act 2008. See
“Industry Overview—UK Clean Energy Legislation—The Climate Change Act 2008”.

While the UK and the EU have, in recent years, adopted policies and support mechanisms actively
supporting electricity generation from renewable resources and specifically biomass, it is possible that this
approach could change in the future due to a change in Government or a change in Government policy. Any
change in the Government’s policy towards fossil fuels, including alterations to the price of the Carbon Price
Floor to make it prohibitively expensive to burn coal or to use less efficient gas plants for electricity generation,
may have an adverse effect on operations and results of our coal and gas-fired units. Conversely, an abandonment
of support for renewable energy in general, or for biomass in particular, could render our biomass generation
uncompetitive in comparison with other technologies and have a material adverse effect on our business,
operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. For example, until August 2015, we received
LECs for electricity generated from the generation units that had been converted to biomass which could be sold
to electricity suppliers, and Power Generation revenue in 2015 included £17 million of revenue from LECs.
Effective 1 August 2015, renewable electricity generation is no longer eligible for LECs, which had a negative
impact on our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA.

32


-----

Following a national referendum in June 2016, on 29 March 2019, the Government formally initiated the
withdrawal process of the UK’s departure from the EU (“Brexit”). The effects of Brexit could be significant as
the Government would no longer be subject to the set of EU directives which commit the EU Member States to
reducing carbon emissions, increasing energy efficiency and increasing renewable energy production. In
particular, the UK’s status as a participant in the EU Emissions Trading System (“EU ETS”) post-Brexit is
unclear. Any change in the Government’s policy towards renewable energy targets could have a material adverse
effect on our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. See “—Changes in
_governmental policy, regulation or legislation in relation to carbon emissions, in particular following or as a_
_result of Brexit, may materially adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition and results of_
_operations”._

The Government controls the costs of supporting low-carbon electricity levy-funded schemes, including the
RO Scheme, CfD Regime and SS-FiT through the Control for Low Carbon Levies (the “LCL Control”). The
LCL Control covers all existing and new low-carbon electricity levies, including the RO Scheme, CfD Regime
and SS-FiT, and affirms the current subsidy support for existing projects but based on the current projection of
levy spend on such low carbon schemes it is anticipated that there will be no new low carbon electricity levies
until 2025. Any change to the LCL Control, for example restricting further spend out beyond 2025, could have a
material adverse impact on our business, and in particular our generation from biomass. The Government has a
statutory obligation to review and report to the UK Parliament on the extent to which the Electricity Market
Reform programme of reforms commenced in 2013 has been successful. For example, calls for evidence for the
Capacity Market and EPS components of the Electricity Market Reform package were issued in 2018 following
the five year anniversary of the passing of the Energy Act 2013, and the formal review is expected in summer
2019. See “Industry Overview—Overview of Electricity Market Reform—Capacity Market” for further
information on the Electricity Market Reform. The format and result of this review is unknown, but to the extent
they necessitate additional reform of the electricity market, such changes could have a material adverse impact
on our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

_The Renewables Obligation Scheme_

Renewables Obligation Certificates (“ROCs”) are tradable certificates issued by the Office of Gas and
Electricity Markets (“Ofgem”) to generators generating electricity through renewable resources. See “Industry
_Overview—UK clean energy legislation—The Renewables Obligation”. ROCs are only earned on electricity_
generated from renewable and sustainable sources, which, in the case of biomass, requires strict compliance with
contractual sustainability criteria for biomass pellets. We generate revenue by selling the ROCs we earn to
electricity suppliers in the market who use these certificates in lieu of paying the buyout price. We receive ROCs
at a rate of 1.0 ROC per MWh for renewable energy produced in our first, second and fourth generation units
converted to biomass, subject to a station-level cap. We receive ROCs at a rate of 1.0 ROC per MWh for
generation at our Lanark hydro facility and for generation from approximately 28MW of the 109MW of
generating capacity at our Galloway hydro facility.

As of 1 April 2017, the RO Scheme has been replaced by the CfD Regime for any newly accredited plant or
generation units. Existing plant or generation units already accredited under the RO Scheme (such as Drax Power
Station, including the coal-fired units but excluding the unit receiving support under the CfD Regime, and our
Galloway and Lanark hydro facilities) remain under the RO Scheme until either their period of support ends,
currently designated as 2027, or they obtain support under the CfD Regime instead.

On 22 July 2015, DBEIS, formerly the Department for Energy and Climate Change (“DECC”), confirmed
that co-firing units already receiving support under the RO Scheme that move for the first time into the biomass
conversion bands, would no longer be covered by the Government’s grandfathering policy. As a result, the
recently converted fourth biomass-fired generation unit at Drax Power Station does not benefit from the
grandfathering policy that the first and second units benefit from, and there is no guarantee that the level of
support that it is entitled to receive under the RO Scheme will not be altered in the future.

In July 2018, the Renewables Obligation (Amendment) Order 2018 came into force, establishing an annual
ROC cap at the power station level across all RO accredited biomass-fired generation units equal to DBEIS’s
estimate of the number of ROCs to be received by each grandfathered biomass-fired generation unit (the first and
second converted unit at Drax Power Station) plus 125,000 ROCs for each non-grandfathered unit (the fourth
converted unit at Drax Power Station). While this order provides more certainty as to the intended long-term
regulatory position, there remains the possibility that the annual cap is set at a level that is lower than anticipated
such that the level of support provided to our three biomass-fired generation units under the RO Scheme is
reduced to our detriment.

_Contracts for Difference_

The UK Energy Act 2013 established the CfD Regime as a new support mechanism to replace the RO
Scheme with a period of transition between 2015 and 2018. We secured our CfD under the Final Investment
Decision Enabling for Renewables (“FIDeR”) regime in 2014 for our third biomass-fired conversion unit. This
unit was converted to biomass with support under our CfD in December 2016 following receipt of state aid
approval from the European Commission. As at 1 April 2019, our CfD provides for a strike price of £113.65 per
MWh. The strike price is indexed annually based on the consumer price index and is also adjusted to reflect
average balancing system costs. Our CfD expires on 31 March 2027, and may be terminated before that date if
we breach certain of our obligations under our CfD, for example if we fail to make payments due under the
contract within the applicable grace periods. Support under our CfD is only given on electricity generated from
renewable and sustainable material, and strict compliance with contractual sustainability criteria for biomass
pellets is required. Accordingly, there is a risk that our CfD terminates early and there can be no assurance that
support under our CfD will be available for the period of its initial term.

_RO Scheme and CfD Regime_

Both the RO Scheme and the CfD Regime as they apply to us will end in 2027. Absent a successor support
scheme, the generation of electricity from our biomass-fired generation units may not be economically viable if
the support under the RO Scheme and our CfD fall away.

It is unclear whether any subsidy regime will support generation from sustainable biomass after 2027 or
whether any future subsidy regime would provide sufficient support to make generation from biomass
economically viable. Any future subsidy regime will depend on a number of circumstances beyond our control,
including Government policies at the relevant time, the competitiveness of electricity generation from biomass
compared with other renewable energy sources, and the availability of biomass fuel in sufficient quantities and
on terms that are economical. Lack of Government support for generation from biomass post-2027 may have a
material adverse effect on our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our business is subject to complex regulation, by the Government, the EU and other authorities that has in_**
**_the past and could in the future materially adversely affect us._**

Our business is subject to extensive and complex regulation by the Government and other authorities,
including those in the UK, the EU and the US, such as Ofgem, DBEIS, the Financial Conduct Authority (the
“FCA”), the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators, the Environment Agency, the Health and Safety
Executive, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (“SEPA”) and the US Environmental Protection
Agency. Regulation impacts many areas of our business, including the sourcing of biomass, combustion activity,
the overall energy market structure, the construction and operation of electricity generation facilities, the trading
of commodities and financial derivatives, market behaviour rules, present or prospective wholesale or retail
competition and general health and safety and environmental matters. These rules and policies have affected and
may continue to affect our business, operations and changes in law or regulation, or decisions by Governmental
bodies or regulators could negatively affect our business.

Our Power Generation segment is, in particular, subject to extensive environmental regulation, which has
generally become increasingly strict. For example, since the start of 2016, we have been subject to new, stricter
limits on emissions of, among other things, SO2 and NOx, under UK legislation implementing the EU Industrial
Emissions Directive (“IED”). We have had to make significant investments in new technology to ensure that
Drax Power Station can meet these obligations, including in connection with the requirements of the Best
Available Techniques Reference document for Large Combustion Plants (“BREF”) developed under the IED
that will further reduce air emission limits when it enters into force no later than mid-2021. We may in the future
become subject to even stricter emissions limits or other environmental restrictions, which may require
significant additional investment or may force us to reduce or cease electricity generation from some or all of the
generation units to comply or to install or upgrade pollution control or abatement technology to reduce
emissions. These costs and operational changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results
of operations.

Our B2B Energy Supply segment is required to take all reasonable steps to provide Smart Meters to our
customers by the end of 2020, except for those customers who have already received certain advanced meter
types. There is a risk that we may be unable to provide such Smart Meters as required prior to the end of 2020,
which may potentially result in exposure to fines from Ofgem.

34


-----

More generally, Ofgem also requires electricity suppliers to provide advanced meters allowing automated
meter readings (“AMRs”) to certain customers by and from April 2014, as a condition to their supply licences.
Failure to comply with the obligation to provide Smart Meters and/or any investigations into our B2B Energy
Supply segment’s compliance with its AMR obligations may result in the issue of material fines by Ofgem.

Following a public consultation, the Government announced in September 2017 an end to unabated
electricity generation from coal by 2025. As such, we would have to cease electricity generation from the two
coal-fired generation units at Drax Power Station by 2025 unless they have been upgraded to run on an
alternative fuel or else converted to meet the operating requirements imposed by relevant regulatory requirements
(such as addition of abatement equipment or carbon capture and storage capabilities). Subject to receipt of proper
support through the Capacity Market, we anticipate repurposing our existing units to alternative fuel under our
ongoing coal-to-gas repowering project, but if we are unsuccessful then we may be forced to cease using them,
which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results
of operations.

In 2017 the Government announced its intention to focus on what it sees as unfair treatment of domestic
consumers on legacy Standard Variable Tariff (“SVT”) contracts. In July 2018, the Domestic Gas and Electricity
(Tariff Cap) Act 2018 came into force, introducing a temporary tariff cap for customers on SVTs beginning in
January 2019. The level of the cap is set by Ofgem for each six-month cap period. Similar contracts exist in the
B2B market, predominantly following the expiry of fixed term contracts in circumstances where the customer
has not moved supplier, and any extension of the legislative requirements on this subject (for example, any
proposal capping prices or else seeking to apply fixed profit margins) to smaller SME businesses may have an
adverse effect on our B2B Energy Supply segment’s business and results of operations.

A change in Government or a change in Government policy or political structure could lead to a changed
regulatory environment which may materially adversely impact the business of the Group. In particular, the UK’s
official opposition, the UK Labour Party, stated in its manifesto in the 8 June 2017 UK General Election its
commitment to regaining control of energy supply networks through alteration of operator licence conditions,
and transition to a publicly owned, decentralised energy distribution system. The UK Labour Party has also
stated its commitment to the nationalisation of various public utilities. While the 2017 UK General Election did
not lead to a Labour Government, a change in Government could lead to future intervention in the energy
markets.

Other relevant changes in the regulatory environment may involve, for example:

   - changes to, or withdrawal of, subsidy and financial support mechanisms related to the conversion to
renewable energy sources, such as biomass. See “—The reduction or abandonment of governmental
_support for generation of electricity from biomass or other relevant changes in governmental energy_
_policy may adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition and results of operations”;_

   - changes in Government policy relating to the mix of energy sources used for generation, for example a
reduction in Government support for gas-fired generation;

   - changes in legislation or policies related to tax;

   - introduction of export tariffs or restrictions on the import of biomass or other fuels. See “—The result of
_the UK referendum on withdrawal from the EU may have a negative effect on economic conditions,_
_financial markets and demand for our products and services, which could materially adversely affect our_
_business, results of operations and financial condition”;_

   - adverse decisions on grants or renewals of licences, approvals or agreements required for the operation of
our business, or related to our compliance with the terms of a licence, approval or regulatory requirement;

   - changes in regulations that affect exemptions that we rely on for trading financially settled derivatives,
margining requirements, collateral requirements (and associated costs) and reporting obligations;

   - restrictions on the timely recovery of incurred expenditure or obligations, the ability to pass through
commodity costs or a decoupling of energy usage and revenue and other general economic decisions
having an effect on our financial condition, markets and customers;

   - new or stricter climate change and environmental laws and regulations, including carbon emissions limits
both nationally and internationally. See “—Changes in governmental policy, regulation or legislation in
_relation to carbon emissions, in particular following or as a result of Brexit, may materially adversely_
_affect our business, operations, financial condition and results of operations”;_

35

   - introduction of more stringent requirements in relation to the retail electricity market, including
limitations or restrictions on the amount of profits retail suppliers can make and price freezes in relation
to retail supply;

   - limitations or restrictions on the amount of profits retail suppliers can make and price freezes in relation
to retail supply;

   - introduction of more stringent requirements in relation to environmental and health and safety laws,
including sustainability criteria for biomass pellets and regulations relating to emissions to air and water,
noise, soil, groundwater contamination, waste, and health and safety standards;

   - introduction of new and/or additional legislation or licence requirements affecting the way in which our
B2B Energy Supply segment interacts with or charges its customers such as in relation to customer data;
and

   - a failure to reinstate the Capacity Market. See “—The Capacity Market in the UK is currently suspended
_and its future is uncertain”._

Changes in the regulatory environment applicable to our business could have a material adverse effect on
our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations and the ability to develop our
businesses in the future.

**_The Capacity Market in the UK is currently suspended and its future is uncertain._**

Following a legal challenge initiated by an industry participant, on 15 November 2018, the General Court of
the European Union issued a ruling annulling the European Commission’s 2014 decision not to undertake a more
detailed investigation of the Government’s scheme establishing the Capacity Market (the “Capacity Market
**Ruling”). The Capacity Market Ruling imposed a “standstill period” while the European Commission completes**
a further “phase two” state aid investigation into the Capacity Market. Payments to generators scheduled under
existing capacity agreements and the holding of future capacity auctions have been suspended. Furthermore, in
the wake of the Capacity Market Ruling, a judicial review proceeding has been brought in the UK by an industry
participant seeking to stop DBEIS from implementing new auctions during the suspension period, claw back
historic payments made under certain Capacity Market auctions and prevent the voluntary payment of Capacity
Market charges by electricity suppliers during the standstill period.

For the period 1 October 2018 to 30 September 2022, our two coal and three ancillary gas units at Drax
Power Station have contracted aggregate capacity payments of approximately £83 million. For the period from
1 October 2018 to 30 September 2022, the assets we acquired in connection with the DGEL Acquisition have
contracted capacity payments in an aggregate amount of £156 million, comprised of the Cruachan pumped
storage hydro asset with £29 million, the Galloway hydro asset with £5 million, and the Damhead Creek, Rye
House, Shoreham and Blackburn CCGT stations with £122 million in aggregate. As a result of the Capacity
Market Ruling, the DGEL Acquisition Agreement includes a compensation mechanism whereby if 100 per cent.
of contracted Capacity Market payments are not received for the period from 1 January to 30 September 2019, a
further payment could be made by either us or the previous shareholder of DGEL, up to a maximum of £26
million. The DGEL Acquisition Agreement’s compensation mechanism does not cover any periods subsequent to
30 September 2019.

Even if the European Commission grants a new state aid clearance in relation to the Capacity Market, there
is no guarantee that the capacity payments suspended between the date of the Capacity Market Ruling and the
date of the new clearance will be paid to generators. This will depend both on the outcome of the European
Commission’s investigation and on the Government’s response thereto. DBEIS has indicated its intent, in a
consultation document dated 19 December 2018, to work with the European Commission to achieve a
reinstatement of the Capacity Market as soon as possible. Furthermore, although DBEIS has indicated that, upon
reinstatement, it expects to make back payments to generators who have complied with their capacity agreements
during the standstill period, reinstatement remains conditional upon EU state aid re-approval and accordingly
remains uncertain. In the event that suspended capacity payments are not paid, the Capacity Market arrangements
agreed in the DGEL Acquisition Agreement may be insufficient to compensate for the lost contracted payments.

Any new state aid approval of the Capacity Market granted by the European Commission may be subject to
conditions that the form of the Capacity Market is amended from its current design. This may include the
condition that existing capacity agreements are invalidated and that current and future capacity auctions need to
be re-run. In these circumstances, there would be no guarantee that any amended form of Capacity Market would
provide comparable contracted payments to those we expect to receive under the existing Capacity Market, that

36


-----

future capacity auctions would be re-run on terms comparable to the existing Capacity Market or that we would
be successful in those re-run auctions.

If the Capacity Market is not reinstated, it may be replaced by a new mechanism which is not as
advantageous to the Group, or may not be replaced at all. If no new clearance is given by the European
Commission, and/or no new Capacity Market mechanism is introduced, we will be more exposed to wholesale
electricity prices due to the reduction in contracted revenue streams and cannot predict the extent to which prices
may adjust as a result of market participants adjusting their pricing to mitigate lost Capacity Market revenues.

It is not possible to predict with certainty the duration or outcome of the European Commission’s phase two
investigation. The duration of the current suspension of payments and auctions is therefore uncertain. Capacity
payments expected to be received by the Group in 2019 and thereafter could be delayed for an extended period or
not received at all. If the suspension is upheld, one of several potential outcomes could be that the previous
Capacity Market auction revenues are annulled and new Capacity Market auctions required with new parameters.

If any aspect of the judicial review proceeding is successful, this may prevent or else delay the holding of
future Capacity Market auctions by DBEIS. A successful challenge may also make it difficult for suppliers to
comply with their payment obligations under the Capacity Market, increasing the risk of supplier insolvencies
and the risk of mutualisation payments being made by our B2B Energy Supply segment.

Separately, there is also a risk that previous Capacity Market payments received by Drax (or DGEL), or the
basis on which such payments were awarded, could be challenged and could result in such payments being
clawed back. If such challenge were successful it could have a material adverse effect on our business operations,
prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

Each of these outcomes has the potential to have a material adverse impact on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_The result of the UK referendum on withdrawal from the EU may have a negative effect on economic_**
**_conditions, financial markets and demand for our products and services, which could materially adversely_**
**_affect our business, results of operations and financial condition._**

We are based in and operate principally within the UK. Brexit negotiations are ongoing and are expected to
last until October 2019. The outcome of the referendum and the lack of clarity regarding the terms of withdrawal
have created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the UK and the EU, and have given
rise to calls for certain regions within the UK (including, for example, Scotland) to preserve their place in the EU
by separating from the UK. Depending on the terms of Brexit, the UK could lose access to the single EU market
and customs union (and the Government has stated its expectation that the UK will lose such access), resulting in
an impact on the general and economic conditions in the UK, which could adversely affect demand for electricity
and will directly impact the financial condition of our customers which could have a negative impact on our
revenues. A significant weakening of economic conditions in the UK accompanied by higher insolvency rates
could also impact our receivables growth and amount of bad debt in the B2B Energy Supply segment, and could
also result in a decrease in energy consumption, which could adversely affect our performance.

The weakening of pound sterling associated with Brexit increases the currency exchange rate risk which we
face, in particular as most of the biomass we purchase is priced in non-sterling currencies (US dollars, Canadian
dollars or euro). Whilst we have hedged 100 per cent. of our contracted exposures and all highly probable
exposures through a five-year rolling foreign exchange programme, to the extent these hedges do not provide
effective protection, this could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. For
further details, see “—We are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk and our business and results of
_operations may be negatively affected by fluctuation of different currencies”._

The UK’s post-Brexit relationship with the EU has yet to be finally defined and there are a number of risks
which we may face as a result. If the UK were to leave the EU customs union, this could result in new or
increased tariffs being levied on our imports of wood pellets (albeit no tariffs are currently applied to biomass
wood pellets under relevant World Trade Organisation rules) or the imposition of other non-tariff barriers such as
higher documentation requirements or more time-consuming custom checks. We have finite storage capacity at
ports and at Drax Power Station and delays in unloading vessels at ports caused by the imposition of other nontariff barriers (such as higher documentation requirements or more time-consuming custom checks) risk causing
disruption to our wider biomass supply chain and our ability to ensure that Drax Power Station has sufficient fuel
to generate at its optimal levels. It may also impact liquidity in the UK electricity and gas markets, as a result of
“market decoupling” between the UK and the rest of the EU and the migration of electricity and gas

37


-----

brokers/counterparties trading operations from the UK to the EU and reduce liquidity in derivative markets to the
extent that the terms of Brexit prevent our counterparties from trading in the UK under the EU’s passporting
rules for financial services firms.

The effects of Brexit could be significant as the Government may no longer be subject to the rulings of the
Court of Justice of the European Union, or subject to the set of EU directives which commit the EU Member
States to reducing carbon emissions, increasing energy efficiency and increasing renewable energy production. In
particular, the UK’s status as a participant in the EU ETS post-Brexit is unclear. Any change in the
Government’s policy towards renewable energy targets could have a material adverse effect on our business,
operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. See “—Changes in governmental policy,
_regulation or legislation in relation to carbon emissions, in particular following or as a result of Brexit, may_
_materially adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition and results of operations”._

**_Changes in governmental policy, regulation or legislation in relation to carbon emissions and carbon pricing,_**
**_in particular following or as a result of Brexit, may materially adversely affect our business, operations,_**
**_financial condition and results of operations._**

The details of the UK’s future legislative and regulatory framework in relation to carbon emissions and
carbon pricing is currently unclear as a result of Brexit. In particular, the UK’s status as a participant in the EU
ETS post-Brexit is unclear. The EU ETS is currently an important part of the UK’s total carbon price (along with
the Carbon Price Support). If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement as to the terms of its withdrawal (i.e. a
“no deal” scenario), the Government has confirmed that the UK would cease to participate in the EU ETS and a
carbon emissions tax would be introduced to help meet the UK’s legally binding carbon reduction commitments
under the Climate Change Act 2008. Given the delay to Brexit, there is some uncertainty regarding any potential
switch-over date between the two regimes, should the EU ETS cease to apply. For 2019, a rate of £16 would be
applied to each tonne of carbon dioxide emitted over and above an installation’s emissions allowance, which
would be based on the installation’s free allowance allocation under the EU ETS. When added to the current
Carbon Price Support, this would effectively increase the UK’s total carbon emissions tax to £34 per tonne,
compensating for the loss of the EU ETS.

The Government has indicated that it is continuing to develop options for long term carbon pricing,
including remaining in the EU ETS, establishing a UK ETS (linked to the EU ETS or standalone) or a carbon tax.
Any change in the legislative or regulatory framework in relation to carbon emissions and carbon pricing, or to
the Government’s policy towards fossil fuels or renewable energy targets, in particular following or as a result of
Brexit, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results
of operations.

**_Future changes in legislation might impact the supply of electricity and gas to the retail market, which could_**
**_include restrictions on retail prices or our ability to pass on costs._**

Government policy might impact the electricity or gas price by imposing restrictions on the prices that can
be charged to end users. It is difficult to predict the manner in which this would impact the wholesale price.
However, if the Government were to uncouple the wholesale price from the price of commodities and other costs
through a price freeze or similar action (as came into force for the UK domestic market in January 2019), this
could lead to a reduction in our revenues from energy supply. Restrictions on prices that our B2B Energy Supply
segment is able to charge its customer base or on our B2B Energy Supply segment’s ability to implement the
price change provisions in its supply contracts or any requirement to extend fixed term contracts on the same
terms may also adversely affect the business and results of our B2B Energy Supply segment by reducing its
operating margins.

**_Our cost of compliance with environmental laws and regulations, as well as costs to address any_**
**_environmental liabilities arising from our operating activities, could have a material adverse effect on our_**
**_business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations._**

We are subject to laws and regulations relating to pollution, including wastewater discharges and air
emissions, the protection of the environment, and the generation, use and disposal of hazardous substances and
waste materials. Following the DGEL Acquisition, our newly-acquired assets increase the scope of regulation to
which the Group is subject to include requirements relating to dams, reservoirs and watercourses, including
under the Water Environment (Controlled Activities) (Scotland) Regulations 2011 (as amended) (“CAR”) and
the Reservoirs (Scotland) Act 2011. If we fail to comply with any of these requirements, we could be subject to
civil or criminal liabilities and fines or operation of our facilities could be forcibly stopped, curtailed or modified.
In addition, we could incur signficant costs to achieve or maintain compliance with existing or future

38


-----

environmental laws or the terms in our permits, including costs related to the installation or upgrade of pollution
control or safety equipment. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations,
prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

Our Cruachan, Galloway and Lanark facilities are operated under licences issued by SEPA under CAR,
which implements the requirements of the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC). Under CAR, SEPA
conducts risk assessments and, where appropriate, grants authorisations in respect of certain activities, including
but not limited to impounding works and abstractions, which could affect Scotland’s water environment. A
failure to adapt to, and comply with, this increased regulatory burden or else adequately to remedy any legacy
issues with the acquired sites may result in civil or criminal liabilities, including fines or penalties which, if
levied, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results
of operations.

Our US wood pellet manufacturing facilities are also subject to local environmental laws and operate under
various environmental permits. In 2018, independent testing at our facilities found emissions-to-air levels to have
exceeded permitted levels. Whilst we voluntarily reported the results of this testing to the relevant local
regulators and continue to work proactively with the regulators to remedy these matters and obtain appropriate
revised permits, there can be no guarantees that we will not be subject to regulatory actions or sanctions for noncompliance or else be required to incur significant expenditure (for example, in relation to installing emissions
control equipment) to remedy the matter.

We could incur liability under national or local laws or regulations, either as a polluter or as an owner and
operator of our facilities, including Drax Power Station, our planned gas plants and the gas, hydro and biomassfrom-waste facilities we acquired as part of the DGEL Acquisition. Furthermore, thermal electricity generation
facilities and biomass-from-waste facilities typically use and generate hazardous and potentially hazardous
products and by-products. In addition, potentially hazardous activities that arise in connection with our business
include the operation and maintenance of electricity generation facilities (including in connection with the
disposal of by-products associated with such generation such as ash disposal which is disposed of on Drax Power
Station site), the operation and maintenance of our Daldowie biomass-from-waste facility, the operation and
maintenance of our pellet production plants and port facilities and transporting physical commodities,
particularly biomass, which is highly combustible.

The Group carries insurance that covers certain environmental liabilities resulting from sudden and
accidental pollution. At this time, the Government does not mainitain any financial reserves for environmental
liabilities. Accordingly, costs to address such liabilities that are not covered by our insurance could have a
material adverse effect on our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, we may be responsible for any on-site liabilities associated with the environmental condition of
facilities that we own, have acquired, leased or developed, such as the wood pellet manufacturing facilities in the
US, the planned OCGT plants and the assets of the DGEL Group, regardless of when the liabilities arose and
whether they are known or unknown. In connection with certain acquisitions and sales of assets, we may obtain,
or be required to provide, indemnification against certain environmental liabilities. Another party could,
depending on the circumstances, assert an environmental claim against us or fail to meet its indemnification
obligations. Any costs incurred in relation to such environmental liabilities over and above those covered by
applicable insurance policies could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, prospects,
financial condition and results of operations.

We commit significant expenditure towards complying with these laws and regulations and meeting our
obligations. If more onerous requirements are imposed or our ability to recover these costs under applicable
regulation changes, this could adversely affect our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results
of operations.

**_Our operations expose us to the risk of material health and safety liabilities, which could result in claims,_**
**_fines and penalties._**

On account of the nature of our operations, we are subject to various statutory compliance and litigation
risks under health and safety and employment laws, including in England, Scotland and the US. In particular, our
Power Generation operations, the manufacturing process at our pellet production facilities and our port
operations at Baton Rouge all require the operation of heavy machinery and other forms of industrial equipment
that increase health and safety risk, including of personal injury or death. In addition, there is also an inherent
risk of fire, explosion and personal injury from dust inhalation that arises from the inappropriate handling and
burning of biomass. See “—We rely on an uninterrupted supply chain for biomass and, to a lesser extent, coal.

39


-----

_Any interruptions of the supply chain may prevent Drax Power Station from functioning at full capacity and_
_prevent us from performing our supply obligations under our contracts”._

In 2018, we recorded fifteen recordable incidents (compared to nineteen in 2017 and thirteen in 2016) and
had a total recordable injury rate (defined as the sum of fatalities, lost time injuries and medical treatment injuries
per 100,000 hours worked) of 0.22. In 2018, DGEL recorded two recordable incidents and had a total recordable
injury rate of 0.31. There could be future accidents or incidents suffered by our employees, our contractors or
other third parties at our facilities and/or construction projects and it is possible that the regulator could take
action in respect of previously reported incidents. If a formal investigation is opened in respect of any reportable
incident by any relevant regulatory authority in England, Wales, Scotland or the US, and the findings are adverse
to the Group, this could affect our brand image, reputation, press coverage and could have a material adverse
effect on our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

If we fail to put in place appropriate procedures and/or any of these incidents occur, we could be subject to
prosecutions and litigation, which may lead to fines, penalties, criminal sanctions and other damages being
imposed, or restrictions on the scope of our operations, and cause damage to our reputation and brand image,
result in negative press coverage, and possibly have political and regulatory implications. Such events could have
a material adverse effect on our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

We are subject to an increased scope of health and safety obligations and an increased regulatory burden as
a result of acquiring a more diversified generation and operational portfolio across both England and Scotland in
connection with the DGEL Acquisition. A failure to adapt to, and comply with, this increased regulatory burden
or else adequately to remedy any legacy issues with the acquired sites may result in civil or criminal liabilities,
including fines or penalties which, if levied, would have a material adverse effect on our business, operations,
prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We are required to satisfy certain sustainability criteria under the RO Scheme and our CfD, and UK or EU_**
**_sustainability policy changes could be excessively onerous and make it difficult for us to comply with these_**
**_policy requirements._**

To be eligible to receive support under the RO Scheme or the CfD Regime, biomass burned in Drax Power
Station must meet strict sustainability criteria. These criteria are directed at ensuring that, among other things,
feedstock is sourced sustainably and overall emissions from harvesting, converting the feedstock into pellets,
transporting and burning the pellets are under a certain level (which limit will decrease over time). Although in
the case of certain changes to sustainability criteria, we may be compensated for operating expenditure if we can
demonstrate that such change directly results in additional operating costs that would otherwise cause the
permanent cessation of operation of the biomass-fired generation unit receiving support under our CfD, the terms
of our CfD only provide very limited protection against the impact of any changes in these criteria, including
changes that are enacted or come into effect after the date of our CfD. We will have to comply with changed
sustainability criteria at our cost to the extent these are deemed to be foreseeable at the date of our CfD or where
such change in law, regulation or guidance represents a continuous improvement or development of good
practice. Any change in the applicable sustainability criteria could have a material adverse effect on our business,
operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_An inability to source fuel to the correct technical specification could lead to a reduced output from Drax_**
**_Power Station._**

Drax Power Station is only able to burn coal and biomass that meet its specifications as to, among other
things, their calorific content. The specifications for biomass are particularly stringent. If fuel meeting these
specifications is not available in sufficient amounts, generation at Drax Power Station may be reduced.

Biomass fuel is derived from forestry residues and woody materials, and although typically more
homogeneous than coal from a chemical composition perspective, there is some variability. The degree of
variability on biomass received by us is controlled through the contract fuel specification, which contains ranges
for key parameters such as calorific value, ash, moisture and physical characteristics. The consequence of this
variability is that at times biomass generation can be adversely affected by lack of appropriate fuel. This could
delay the anticipated supply of biomass fuel to Drax Power Station and as a result Drax Power Station’s ability to
generate electricity may be reduced.

If a biomass fuel supplier is unable to meet some or all of its contractual obligations, we may have to secure
replacement biomass fuel which in the event of an illiquid market could result in us incurring additional variable
costs. In addition, our biomass supply chain may also be disrupted by adverse weather, for example in

40


-----

the US Gulf region, where hurricanes are prevalent. Other weather events, such as the unseasonably wet and
unpredictable weather in the US in winter 2018/2019, may also lead to a reduction in the amount and timing of
deliveries and/or adversely impact the availability of alternative replacement volumes in the spot market. Such
events could result in additional costs or loss of revenue that could adversely affect our business, operations,
prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

Additionally, if our sourcing procedures are inappropriate and we fail to use coal or biomass of the requisite
specification in our generation units, generation at Drax Power Station may be reduced and may result in damage
to our facilities.

**_Adverse litigation, negative news and other publicity regarding the use of biomass for electricity generation_**
**_may have an adverse impact on our reputation, business and results of operations._**

Special interest groups, environmental groups and public figures have in the past, and may in the future,
allege that the environmental benefits of electricity generation from biomass are elusive by questioning the
sustainability benefits of our biomass sourcing. Such adverse litigation or negative publicity could change public
and the Government’s perception of biomass and result in unfavourable changes to Government policy or
regulation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results
of operations.

In March 2019, a case was filed in the General Court of the European Union seeking to annul the forest
biomass provisions of the Recast Renewable Energy Directive ((EU) 2018/2001) (“RED II”) in order to render
forest wood ineligible for meeting EU Member State renewable energy targets. If the plaintiffs in this case are
successful, generation from biomass may cease to receive Government support and may no longer be exempt
from either the Carbon Price Support or requirements to purchase emissions allowances under the EU ETS. Any
of these events could make generation from biomass uneconomical, which would have a material adverse effect
on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We are dependent on continued output from our facilities, in particular Drax Power Station, and outages at_**
**_Drax Power Station or any of our other facilities (including facilities acquired in connection with the DGEL_**
**_Acquisition) could negatively affect our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of_**
**_operations._**

The successful operation of our business depends on maintaining the integrity of our key systems and
equipment, such as Drax Power Station and the wood pellet manufacturing facilities in the US. For the year
ended 31 December 2018, 93 per cent. of our Adjusted EBITDA was derived from the sale of electricity
produced by Drax Power Station, the receipt of subsidies related thereto (in the form of ROCs earned by Drax
Power Station or payments under our CfD), income relating to the provision of Ancillary Services and income
under Capacity Market agreements. If operations at Drax Power Station or at any of our other generating
facilities were to be materially interrupted, curtailed or reduced for any reason, it could adversely affect our
business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Drax Power Station, the generating
facilities acquired in connection with the DGEL Acquisition and our other systems and equipment may be
subject to mechanical failure, equipment malfunction, technological breakdown or other interruptions from
events, some of which are beyond our control, including:

   - fire, explosion, flood and other natural disasters;

   - adverse weather conditions;

   - failures of the electricity grid;

   - failure to procure fuel in an efficient manner or failure of fuel transportation equipment;

   - mechanical failures, for example, failures of the generation units or the distribution systems that provide
the fuel to the generation units;

   - telecommunication or data networking failures;

   - failure to control humidity and other environmental factors at biomass storage or transport facilities;

   - failure to satisfy increasingly complex IT requirements at Drax Power Station and within the Group more
generally, including in respect of the DGEL Group generation sites;

   - terrorism;

41


-----

   - unauthorised physical or electronic access, including cyber-attacks (for example, the Government has
recently warned of the potential for a large-scale cyber-attack on the UK’s infrastructure and energy
supply from foreign agents, which could have wide-ranging and devastating consequences); and

   - industrial action.

Availability of Drax Power Station’s units is influenced by planned maintenance outages, as well as
unplanned or forced outages, which are required from time to time to rectify malfunctions or other failures.
During 2018, Drax Power Station’s availability for our first three biomass-fired generation units was above our
target, despite two unplanned outages in the first quarter of 2018. We are currently undertaking a major planned
outage on our fourth biomass-fired generation unit and anticipate undertaking a major planned outage on our
second biomass-fired generation unit in autumn 2019. We also expect to undertake a planned outage at our Rye
House CCGT power station and a minor inspection at our Damhead Creek CCGT power station during 2019. See
“Our Business—Power Generation—Availability”.

Forced outages decrease the amount of electricity that the relevant generation unit at Drax Power Station is
able to generate over a given period, which translates into decreased potential revenue for us. Furthermore,
additional costs may be incurred in recovering from any such forced outage. Prolonged forced outages, or
additional planned outages that become required as a result of a regulatory change, could have a material adverse
effect on our revenue, profitability, financial position and cash flows. In addition, forced outages could also
damage our reputation.

The most frequent cause of a forced outage of a generation unit at Drax Power Station is a boiler tube leak
in that generation unit. Such leaks occur at Drax Power Station approximately 25 times a year and ordinarily take
two to three days to remedy. More severe forced outages, which are less common, could curtail, and have in the
past curtailed, generation of a particular unit or multiple units for a longer period, increasing any adverse impact
on our revenue and profitability. For example, in December 2017 a fire on a biomass conveyor between Drax
Power Station’s rail unloading facility and its biomass storage domes resulted in an unplanned outage and
cessation of generation on two biomass generating units for a period of approximately four weeks. Although this
issue did not directly relate to the operation of the biomass-fired generation units, the resulting restriction on fuel
deliveries by rail impacted our ability to generate at maximum output across all our biomass units, such that we
were forced temporarily to curtail generation from those biomass units receiving support under the RO Scheme.
We also experience gas and coolant leaks in the ordinary course of business that can affect the availability of our
generation units. Forced outages are expected in large generating plants and accordingly our business plan
assumes that availability of Drax Power Station over the course of a year will be impacted by a number of forced
outages. For example, we experienced a gas and coolant issue affecting one of our biomass-fired generation units
in February 2018 which resulted in an outage of approximately six weeks.

Similar outages can also occur at our other generation assets. For example, a compressor failure at our
Shoreham power station in January 2019 which we estimate will result in the asset being unable to recommence
generation until autumn 2019. The remote location and complex configuration of certain of our assets acquired in
connection with the DGEL Acquisition, particularly the Cruachan pumped storage power plant, may result in
longer and more significant disruptions in the event that disruptions occur at those sites. See “—The maintenance
_of Drax Power Station, our wood pellet manufacturing facilities in the US and our other facilities, including our_
_generation facilities recently acquired in connection with the DGEL Acquisition, requires substantial capital_
_expenditure and may not be adequate to prevent plant failure.” Additionally, failures of grid-access or other_
infrastructure at any of our facilities could lead to significant disruptions in generation. For example, prior to the
DGEL Acquisition, the availability of our Cruachan pumped-storage facility was limited by network transformer
works in 2017.

Our coal-fired generation units have higher generation costs than the “marginal plant”, in particular during
the summer months. We run the coal-fired generation units less and cease generation in low demand periods,
such as overnight, when they are not economically viable. As a result, the coal-fired generation units need to be
turned down and started up more frequently. We believe that the increased number of starts increases the risk of
forced outages for the coal-fired generation units, due to increased thermal cycling, which adds stress at a higher
rate than if the coal-fired generation unit was continuously operating at a full load. We believe that reduced coalfired generation unit loads may also increase technical risk in these units.

As a result of our conversion to a predominantly biomass-fuelled generator, we face an increased level of
technical risk. Biomass generation on an industrial scale carries significant uncertainty because it is a relatively
new technology. Unforeseen technical problems may occur as a result of the conversion of Drax Power Station’s
generation units, which were originally designed to burn coal, due to the difference in the chemical composition
between biomass and coal.

42


-----

There is no extended history of industrial large-scale biomass conversions or know-how as to the potential
adverse long-term effects of burning biomass in a boiler originally designed for coal. Whilst all of our biomassfired generation units have had at least one major planned outage since their respective conversions and no
adverse effects have been identified, there could be, for example, corrosion, erosion and fouling of the boiler,
which could lead to increased forced outage rates on biomass units. In addition, the hygroscopic nature (tendency
to absorb moisture from the air) of biomass increases the likelihood of pellet degradation, in turn increasing the
risk of fire and explosions. These risks may be further enhanced as existing supply-demand imbalances in the
pellet market place suppliers under price pressure which in turn could negatively impact the quality of wood
pellets supplied to us.

Our CCGT generation units are flexible, mid-efficiency plants that operate when margins are positive or
else to provide system support services. As a result, the units start frequently and operate over their full load
capability. We believe that the increased number of starts increases the risk of forced outages, due to increased
thermal cycling, which adds stress at a higher rate than if the CCGT was continuously operating at a full load.
The CCGT generating units are at the mid-to-end of their life range and there are increased technical risks
associated with high total starts and/or high accumulated operating hours, such as fatigue and creep, that need
managing.

We may not be able to generate sufficient electricity to perform our obligations under our wholesale supply
contracts due to outages at Drax Power Station or our other generation facilities. In such cases, we may have to
purchase the shortfall of electricity from the wholesale market at unfavourable prices or increase output from
other, less profitable, generation facilities to perform our obligations under the contracts and may suffer losses.
We may suffer further losses due to balancing charges applied by the System Operator to cover the costs of
remedying the lost output on the grid. We may also have to sell excess fuel back to the market, including at suboptimal prices in the spot market, or reduce future purchases. Each of these events could adversely impact our
business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We rely on an uninterrupted supply chain for biomass and, to a lesser extent, coal and gas. Any interruptions_**
**_of the supply chain may prevent Drax Power Station or our other generation facilities from functioning at full_**
**_capacity and prevent us from performing our supply obligations under our contracts._**

_Transportation_

Biomass and coal need to be transported to Drax Power Station from domestic and overseas suppliers. We
rely on the continued availability of sufficient international sea freight capacity, port and rail capacity and UK
infrastructure to handle and transport biomass and coal in a timely and efficient manner. We currently have
contracts in place for port capacity (and redundancy) that enable us to receive the required amounts of fuel into
the UK. Our contract with one of the four ports handling our biomass will expire in October 2022 (with an option
to extend the term in one year increments) while the contracts with the remaining three ports will expire on or
after 2027. Our contract with the port handling coal expires in 2022 (with an option to extend by a further year).
Any termination of, or failure to renew, these contracts may lead to an increase in costs as supply may have to be
transported from a less optimal port location. Overseas supply of biomass and coal may be affected by port
disruptions, including disruptions which could be caused in the event of a “no deal” withdrawal of the UK from
the EU. See “—The result of the UK referendum on withdrawal from the EU may have a negative effect on
_economic conditions, financial markets and demand for our products and services, which could materially_
_adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition”._

A significant proportion of fuel received at our UK ports is transported to Drax Power Station by rail. A
significant failure in our rail transportation, such as the inability to secure adequate rail paths, damage to the rail
network itself or damage or technical failures in relation to our specialist rolling stock for biomass transportation,
could impede our ability to transport the required volume of fuel to Drax Power Station by rail or may lead to
increased costs as fuel may have to be transported to Drax Power Station via more costly forms of transportation.

Furthermore, changes in shipping and rail regulations, whether relating directly to fuel transportation or
otherwise, may lead to increased costs.

Gas is provided to our gas-fired generation facilities by way of connection to the national gas transmission
or distribution network. Any disruption to these networks or to our ability to access these networks, including for
example technical failures or damage to pipelines or other infrastructure failure, may prevent us from accessing
sufficient gas from the grid to operate our gas generation facilities optimally which could adversely impact our
business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

_Biomass storage_

Biomass cannot be stored outdoors because it tends to absorb moisture from the air. Pellets can
spontaneously combust if inappropriately stored and therefore must be managed. In the case of our loading
facility in the US, humidity poses an additional challenge, which must be addressed using aeration and
temperature monitoring. At the UK discharge ports and at Drax Power Station, the pellets are stored in
technically advanced storage spaces with dust control infrastructure to reduce the risk of fire and explosions. For
example, in December 2017 a fire on a biomass conveyor between Drax Power Station’s rail unloading facility
and its biomass storage domes resulted in an unplanned outage and cessation of generation on two biomass
generating units for a period of approximately four weeks. Any failure of the management controls and
infrastructure or safety procedures at the production facilities could result in fire damage, including personal
injuries, at Drax Power Station, our pellet manufacturing facilities or at our port facilities. Such incidents may
materially hinder our ability to export sufficient biomass to Drax Power Station for a certain amount of time and
our ability to generate electricity at optimum levels or otherwise adversely affect our operations.

Our biomass storage capacity at the UK port facilities and on-site at Drax Power Station is approximately
700,000 tonnes, which corresponds to approximately 30 days’ supply at full capacity. In addition, fuel that is
scheduled to be burned might need to be stored instead due to planned outages or forced outages, which can
result in storage of large volumes of biomass with high storage costs for us. In the case of forced outages,
biomass can quickly accumulate at the ports before it can be moved to strategic storage spaces or be transported
to Drax Power Station at a later date. In the event that storage space at the ports is full and ships are prevented
from unloading, demurrage costs will be incurred if the biomass vessel deliveries cannot be delayed or rerouted.
Excess supply may need to be sold in the spot market, potentially at sub-optimal prices. As a result of failures in
the supply chain, we may not be able to generate electricity at full capacity and may not be able to perform our
supply obligations under our contracts, or may have to operate other less profitable generation facilities to meet
such obligations. We may suffer further losses due to balancing charges applied by the System Operator or may
have to purchase top-up biomass consignments if available.

**_Increased transportation costs could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and_**
**_financial condition._**

Transportation plays an important role in our supply chain as we source the majority of the coal and biomass
required for our Power Generation segment internationally. We currently source most of our coal from the US,
Colombia, Russia and the UK, and most of our biomass from the US, Canada and Europe. We generally rely on
third party service providers to transport fuels and our ability to source fuel at commercially reasonable costs
depends on our ability to negotiate commercially reasonable terms with carriers. Accordingly, any increases in
freight charges, port charges or other transportation costs will, to the extent unhedged, lead to increases in the
cost of our supplies and could adversely affect our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results
of operations. To the extent that third party carriers increase their rates, including to reflect higher labour,
maintenance, fuel (for example, due to new International Maritime Organization regulations requiring lower
sulphur fuels to be used) or other costs they may incur, we may incur higher fuel costs, which may have a
negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Fuel supplies can be destabilised by concentration of supply, market risks, sanctions and geographic risks._**

Biomass pellets at the correct specifications are produced in the UK only in very limited amounts. This
concentration of our supply in certain other countries increases our exposure to risks such as industrial action,
political or economic sanctions, regulatory change, export tariffs, weather risk and political instability, each of
which may lead to a restriction in the supply of the fuel.

The biomass market is a nascent and illiquid market and, if we are not able to secure the required volumes
to fuel the converted units on a long-term basis, this could adversely affect the output of those units. Our US
biomass supply chain is particularly subject to weather risk as it is concentrated in the US Gulf region where
extreme weather such as hurricanes is prevalent. Other weather events, such as the unseasonably wet and
unpredictable weather in the US in winter 2018/2019, may also lead to significant shorts in the biomass market.
Equally, our US port facilities in Baton Rouge are the only port facilities in the area that have the storage and
technical capacity to export the wood pellets manufactured by our wood pellet manufacturing facilities.
Furthermore, given the limited number of participants in the biomass market, it may be difficult for us to obtain
pellets of a sufficient quality and sustainability standard to fuel Drax Power Station and/or trade with
counterparties with a robust credit profile. A breakdown in the supply chain could adversely affect our business,
operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. We have a strategic target to self-supply up to

44


-----

30 per cent. of our internal requirements for generation from sustainable biomass, but an increase to this level
requires us to acquire existing plants or expand organically. Acquisition opportunities in such a nascent market
depend on the existence of willing sellers or else distressed plants coming to market, neither of which can be
guaranteed.

We are subject to commodity price risks that we may not be able to hedge against efficiently and our fuel
costs could increase at a faster rate than UK electricity prices which could negatively affect our operating
margins.

The largest component of our cost of sales is fuel costs, which until the DGEL Acquisition represented the
cost of purchasing the coal (including cost of carbon), sustainable biomass and gas that is used to generate
electricity in Drax Power Station (net of any ROC support earned). Fuel costs amounted to £1,714 million, or
41.5 per cent. of consolidated revenue in 2018 (compared to £1,356.8 million and 36.8 per cent., respectively in
2017) and comprise the cost of biomass, coal and gas. The gross cost of biomass and coal includes the cost of the
raw material, processing costs, logistics, handling and storage costs and is influenced by exchange rates where
the fuel and its transportation is contracted in a foreign currency. Any element of these costs might increase for
coal and biomass without a proportionate increase in UK electricity prices. Following the DGEL Acquisition,
fuel costs will also include gas acquired from the wholesale gas markets for consumption by our CCGT power
stations, as well as the cost of carbon for such stations. Gas is predominantly acquired through trading on the
wholesale gas markets and so whilst we are not directly exposed to certain cost variables, we remain indirectly
exposed to these and to other factors via changes to wholesale gas prices (though we may pass on some of this
cost through increased electricity prices). Whilst gas and electricity prices are correlated, and we regularly enter
into forward and derivative transactions to hedge our exposure to these commodity price and foreign exchange
currency risks, there can be no assurance that such hedging will be available, nor that it will be effective and we
are subject to risks in connection with any such hedging arrangements that we may enter into such as
counterparty risks. There can be no assurances that we will be able to hedge our exposure to these risks in the
future. Any increase in our fuel costs could lead to a reduction in margins and cash flow and therefore adversely
affect our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

_Biomass_

The gross cost of biomass can be broken down into the raw fibre cost, cost of processing the pellets and the
cost of freight and transport to Drax Power Station. Other factors affecting biomass fuel costs include foreign
currency exchange fluctuations (as most biomass is priced in US dollars, Canadian dollars and euro), oil prices
(relevant for transportation and processing costs), freight costs, hedging costs, working capital requirements,
labour rates and inflation.

We seek to fix fuel supply costs as far into the future as liquidity and credit constraints permit. This can be
difficult as suppliers typically are unwilling or unable to manage these costs and seek to pass them through to the
purchaser. Although we seek to hedge exposures where possible, this can be expensive and collateral-intensive.
Moreover, fully hedging these costs on a long-term basis is not practicable due to liquidity and credit restraints.
A reduction in the extent to which we are able to hedge biomass fuel costs could adversely affect our business,
operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations because biomass costs are not correlated to
UK electricity prices and therefore represent a significant source of volatility in earnings and cash flow.

Unlike coal purchases, a number of our biomass supply contracts are entered into on a “take-or-pay” basis.
Should biomass generation become uneconomic or be curtailed for any other reason, we could be required to take
delivery of the biomass in excess of any revised burn estimate and then have to store it, sell it to third parties, if
such purchasers can be found, or pay for the cost of the biomass without taking delivery. This could lead to
losses for us. See “—We rely on an uninterrupted supply chain for biomass and, to a lesser extent, coal. Any
_interruptions of the supply chain may prevent Drax Power Station from functioning at full capacity and prevent_
_us from performing our supply obligations under our contracts”._

_Coal and gas_

The cost of coal and of gas includes both the cost of the actual coal or gas burnt and the cost of the carbon in
the form of the emissions allowances purchased to ensure our compliance with the EU ETS and the levy on coal
or gas deliveries under the Carbon Price Support mechanism. In addition to the risk of coal or gas prices
generally increasing, whether through market price rises and/or exchange rate fluctuations, the cost of carbon
might also increase due to the EU’s intervention in the EU ETS market, amendments to the EU ETS or the UK
ceasing to participate in the EU ETS as a result of Brexit, or else due to a Government decision to further

45


-----

increase the amounts payable under the Carbon Price Support mechanism, notwithstanding that in January 2019,
the Government reaffirmed that the UK will maintain a total carbon price (the combined Carbon Price Support
and the EU ETS allowance price) at around the current level until unabated coal is no longer used. See “—
_Changes in governmental policy, regulation or legislation in relation to carbon emissions and carbon pricing, in_
_particular following or as a result of Brexit, may materially adversely affect our business, operations, financial_
_condition and results of operations”. The cost of coal, gas and emissions allowances is driven by market prices at_
the time we secure our purchases. If we cannot match the timing of coal, gas and emissions allowances purchases
to the related electricity sales or the cost of coal, gas and carbon increases, then this mismatch could have a
negative impact on profitability.

**_The maintenance of Drax Power Station, our wood pellet manufacturing facilities in the US and our other_**
**_facilities, including our generation facilities recently acquired in connection with the DGEL Acquisition,_**
**_requires substantial capital expenditure and may not be adequate to prevent plant failure._**

We are regularly required to make certain operational and maintenance-related capital expenditures at our
sites, such as equipment and other infrastructure maintenance, including machine parts for Drax Power Station
and our other generation facilities (including facilities recently acquired in connection with the DGEL
Acquisition). Our ability to undertake such operational and maintenance measures largely depends on our cash
flow from our operations and access to capital. We intend to continue to fund our cash needs through cash flow
from operations. However, there may be unforeseen capital expenditure needs for which we may not have
adequate capital.

Drax Power Station, our wood pellet manufacturing facilities in the US and our other facilities, including
our other generation facilities recently acquired in connection with the DGEL Acquisition, require regular
maintenance and the provision of this maintenance is itself subject to certain risks. A number of problems may
arise in relation to our facilities during maintenance, which may cause interruptions to production, including,
among other things, failed deliveries by suppliers or manufacturers or longer than expected periods for technical
adjustments. In particular, failure of a contractor to perform our contracted services and/or a change in a
contractor’s financial circumstances in conjunction with an overreliance on particular contractors may, among
other things, result in the relevant asset either underperforming or becoming impaired in value and there can be
no assurance that such underperformance, impairment or delay will be fully or partially compensated by any
contractor warranty or bank guarantee (which are usually limited in scope and quantum, and typically will not
cover full loss of profit). The additional costs and loss of revenue that may arise in the maintenance of facilities
may adversely affect our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

Certain of the assets of the DGEL Group acquired in connection with the DGEL Acquisition, particularly
our Cruachan pumped storage power plant, are located in remote areas and are of a complex configuration.
Technical failures of key components at such facilities (for example, failures of high-voltage transformers) may
lead to longer and more significant disruptions in generation than we are accustomed to due to the increased
delay associated with acquiring, transporting and installing replacement components in such locations and
facilities. Whilst the DGEL Group maintains critical spare components in inventory, it does not hold spares for
all eventualities and the unexpected occurrence of a significant component failure may therefore have a material
adverse effect on our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We face development and operational risks in relation to the construction and operation of the open cycle gas_**
**_turbine assets and the Damhead Creek II closed cycle gas turbine asset, and the repowering of two of our_**
**_coal-fired generation units to gas-fired generation and building supporting battery storage at Drax Power_**
**_Station._**

We are progressing the development of four OCGT projects acquired in December 2016. The development
of these projects remains subject to a positive investment decision and would require appropriate support through
the Capacity Market subject to the reinstatement of Capacity Market auctions.

As part of the DGEL Acquisition, we acquired an option for the development of a further CCGT asset,
Damhead Creek II, which is expected to participate in the next T-3 Capacity Market Auction and/or T-4 Capacity
Market auction subject to the reinstatement of Capacity Market auctions.

There is no guarantee that we will be able to secure these Capacity Market agreements at an economically
attractive price upon reinstatement of the Capacity Market (if reinstated), and if not, we may choose not to
develop the projects and our initial investment could be impaired. See “Industry Overview—Overview of
_Electricity Market Reform—Capacity Market” and “—The Capacity Market in the UK is currently suspended_
_and its future is uncertain”for further information on the Capacity Market._

46


-----

The initial purchase price for the four OCGT projects acquired in December 2016 amounted to £18.6
million. The purchase agreements for two of the OCGT projects also included a mechanism providing for
additional consideration contingent on and calculated by reference to the clearing price in any T-4 Capacity
Market auctions held prior to or during 2020. Accordingly, the total final purchase price for the four OCGT
projects could be as high as £90.5 million if one of the Capacity Market auctions clears at its theoretical
maximum price of £75/kW.

In developing the OCGT projects, we will also have to fund the costs associated with completing the
planning process in connection with the Abergelli project, constructing the four plants and procuring the
necessary equipment, in addition to the purchase price of the projects under their purchase agreements. We
expect that each OCGT project will cost an additional £80 million to £90 million to develop spread over three to
four years. Any delay or objection in relation to the process for obtaining the relevant approvals, permits or
licences, procurement or construction delay or change in Government policy could result in delays to the
estimated commencement date for commercial operations, increased costs, and the need to obtain planning
amendments.

For the Damhead Creek II CCGT project, we will also have to fund the costs associated with constructing
the plant and procuring the necessary equipment. Any procurement or construction delay or change in
Government policy could result in delays to the estimated commencement date for commercial operations or
increased costs of development.

Furthermore, our OCGT and CCGT projects must obtain and maintain connections to the electricity grid
and gas transmission network. This process may be costly and time consuming, as we must obtain, among other
requirements, planning and other consents from relevant authorities, secure any required easements or wayleaves
from landowners and construct the physical connection between the OCGT or CCGT project and the applicable
electricity and gas grids. Any failure or delay to obtain or delay in obtaining the necessary approvals, permits or
licences, enter into the procurement or construction agreements or delays in establishing the connection between
the relevant OCGT or CCGT project and the relevant grid could have a material adverse impact on our business,
operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

Our development options include the opportunity to repower one or both of our coal-fired units at Drax
Power Station to 1.8GW CCGT units (with an initial estimated cost of approximately £600 million per unit,
provided in the related planning application for the projects, spread over a number of years) with up to 200MW
of supporting battery storage, subject to a positive investment decision, obtaining development consent and other
approvals and the award of one or more 15-year Capacity Market agreements in future Capacity Market auctions,
if reinstated. This conversion project is expected to involve significant construction and upgrade work at Drax
Power Station, as well as the installation of a gas pipeline across land owned by third parties. Any failure or
delay to obtain or delay in obtaining the necessary approvals, permits, development consents or licences or to
enter into the relevant procurement or construction agreements, or other delays, could have a material adverse
impact on our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Any unexpected
failures of plant or systems could also have a material adverse impact on our business, operations, prospects,
financial condition and results of operations.

All large-scale development projects such as the OCGT, CCGT and gas-to-coal repowering projects are
complicated and there is the potential for unforeseen issues to arise and unforeseen delays and costs to be
incurred. Any such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business operations, prospects, financial
condition and results of operations.

Additionally, from time to time, environmental groups protest or seek to bring legal challenges to projects to
build new fossil fuel plants. If any of our proposed gas-fired projects were to be successfully challenged, our
ability to develop our portfolio of development projects in the most economical manner or within the proposed
timing could be negatively impacted, which could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition
and results of operations.

**_Our results from operations are dependent on our exposure to UK wholesale electricity prices and the UK_**
**_economy._**

Our profitability and potential growth is determined principally by the prices received for the electricity we
generate and our cost of fuel. All of our generation activities are in the UK, exposing us to significant
concentration risk with respect to the UK electricity price.

The wholesale electricity price in the UK is volatile and is affected by the market demand for electricity and
supply-side factors, including (i) the generation mix of power stations in the UK (particularly the amount of

47


-----

intermittent generation on the system) and the amount of interconnected capacity; and (ii) fluctuations in the
market prices of other commodities. Fluctuations in the wholesale price caused by these factors can occur over a
long or short period of time. Any decrease in the market price of electricity may adversely affect our margins for
the electricity we generate and may result in lower revenues in our B2B Energy Supply segment. A reduction in
the wholesale electricity price in the UK could therefore adversely affect our business, operations, prospects,
financial condition and results of operations.

_Market Demand_

Demand for electricity in the UK has historically been driven by a number of factors outside our control,
such as the overall level of economic activity, seasonality, prevailing weather patterns and increased energy
efficiency. A decrease and/or prolonged deterioration in economic activity in the UK, for any reason, could result
in a decrease in demand for electricity in the market. For example, during the last recession, demand for
electricity from UK industrials decreased by 12.6 per cent. from 114.15TWh in 2008 to 99.74TWh in 2009. A
fall in demand for electricity could lead to a reduction in the wholesale and retail prices for electricity. Short-term
and seasonal fluctuations in electricity demand can also affect the price at which we can sell electricity. Demand
for electricity is typically higher between October and March and lower between April and September. These
seasonal effects can be reinforced or mitigated by weather patterns.

In our B2B Energy Supply segment, longer-term reductions in demand could result in reduced revenue and
profit for Haven Power and Opus if electricity originally purchased to hedge long-term, fixed price supply
agreements destined for customers has to be sold in the market for a lower price than that which could have been
recovered under Haven Power’s and Opus’ supply contracts.

Wholesale electricity prices may also be affected by the level of interconnector capacity connected to the
UK electricity grid. Current continental interconnector capacity is equivalent to approximately 11 per cent. of
peak demand and there are several interconnector projects underway that could bring additional capacity to the
UK in the future. If electricity can be generated cheaply overseas and exported to the UK then this would
displace the more expensive marginal UK plant and reduce electricity prices. This could adversely affect our
business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

_Generation Mix_

The wholesale electricity price is principally driven by the fuel costs of the “marginal plant” as a power
station’s cost of generation is determined largely by the cost of the type of fuel used. Some power stations have
negative marginal costs of generation, such as those that use wind or solar, because the subsidies provided to
these renewable generators exceed the cost of generation. A potential change in the generation mix towards lower
marginal cost electricity generation could bring down the wholesale electricity price and thereby reduce the
revenues we receive from the sale of electricity.

Power stations can be modelled, according to their different costs of generation, as a stack, which is overlaid
with forecasted demand for electricity. The available power stations are drawn on to supply electricity to fulfil
this demand, starting with the power stations that have the lowest costs of generation. At the point in the demand
stack where forecast demand intersects with available supply, the power station supplying electricity at the point
of intersection is known as the “marginal plant”. The price at which the marginal plant is willing to generate
therefore dictates the overall market price.

The generation mix is altered by the changing economics of developing new generating plants or
maintaining existing plants, which is in turn influenced by commodity prices and the level of Government
support given to various generation technologies (including, among others, nuclear, shale gas and renewable
sources such as onshore wind, offshore wind, hydro and biomass) in addition to environmental and other taxes
such as the Carbon Price Support mechanism. Government decisions, for example, to extend or curtail the
operations of nuclear and other generating plants in relation to their presently expected dates of
decommissioning, as well as Government initiatives to support the development of new technologies, such as the
establishment of the Office of Unconventional Gas and Oil for shale gas, have the potential to influence the
generation mix of power stations in the UK by making particular forms of generation more profitable or less
profitable. It can also increase the supply of electricity into the wholesale market, which could have the effect of
lowering the wholesale electricity price.

In recent years, in line with the national push towards renewable energy production, the generation mix in
the UK has shifted to a higher share of electricity generated from renewable sources with negative marginal costs
(such as wind and solar). This trend has resulted in more volatile wholesale electricity prices in the UK due to the

48


-----

intermittent nature of these energy sources. These developments have led to our coal- and gas-fired generation
units generating baseload electricity less frequently and increasingly operating only where there is insufficient
intermittent generation capacity available to fulfil demand.

_Fluctuations in Commodity Prices_

The cost at which a thermal power station can profitably generate electricity is largely determined by the
cost of the type of fuel used, which is susceptible to market forces and varies widely, and the cost of any
emissions allowances required to support generation from fossil fuels. Therefore a decrease in the price of oil,
coal, natural gas or emissions allowances typically leads to lower wholesale electricity prices, in the longer term.

Changes in commodity prices may also influence the generation mix and drive a shift to more efficient,
lower cost power stations. A global surplus of gas may, for example, lead to lower gas prices which could bring
down the wholesale electricity price. If low gas prices persist then the wholesale electricity price might continue
to remain low and could fall further, which could in turn adversely affect our business, operations, prospects,
financial condition and results of operations.

Gas-fired generation is the marginal plant in many periods, and therefore any fall in gas prices could pass
through to wholesale electricity prices. Consequently, low gas prices could indirectly, to the extent unhedged,
adversely affect our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations for our coal and
biomass generation in the short term. A fall in gas prices would be unlikely to impact our gas-fired generation
facilities and any additional gas-fired capability developed in the medium-to-long term due to the correlation
between gas prices and wholesale electricity prices.

_Taxation, Regulation and System Costs_

To the extent that any taxes or other levies, such as Carbon Price Support, transmission or balancing costs,
are embedded within the wholesale cost of energy, any change in the way these are recovered will affect
wholesale prices and potentially their recoverability as third party charges. In addition, any variance in relative
taxes between the UK and interconnected countries may influence the volume and direction of any interconnector
flows, which may raise wholesale prices in the UK.

**_A lack of liquidity in the wholesale market for electricity or gas could adversely affect our results of operations_**
**_or require us to alter our trading strategy._**

Liquidity in the market for wholesale electricity and gas is dependent on there being a sufficient number of
counterparties willing to trade actively. Factors such as changes to the market structure (for example, the
migration of electricity and gas brokers/counterparties trading operations from the UK to the EU) or
consolidation of the existing generation and supply businesses could result in a reduction in the number of active
participants in the market with which we are able to trade. This may affect both our ability to sell all of our
output and the prices at which we sell our output. Poor liquidity in the wholesale market could also lead to retail
suppliers quoting a wider range of prices to customers affecting the competitiveness of the prices quoted by
Haven Power and Opus and lead to a loss of revenue. This could adversely affect our business, operations,
prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_In the future, it may not be possible for us to mitigate against price volatility by selling forward our generated_**
**_output._**

Liquidity for the trading of electricity on a forward basis is currently limited to approximately two years
forward. We attempt to minimise our exposure to price volatility and to achieve revenue certainty by selling
forward a proportion of the electricity we generate. However, there can be no assurance that forward contracts
entered into in the future will capture the best possible price for our electricity, or that there will be sufficient
liquidity in the UK electricity markets to enable us to sell our electricity as far in advance or in such quantities as
we feel is optimal for our business.

Due to the higher cost of carbon in the form of the total carbon price, the cost of coal and gas generation is
higher than it has been historically and forward prices may be such that margins may not be positive. As a result,
the selling forward of coal-generated output will be more challenging until such time as coal-fired generation at
Drax Power Station ceases. If we are unable to enter into such forward sales and prices were to fall in the future,
it could adversely affect our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, there is less liquidity in forward markets than has historically been the case, due to a number of
different factors. Sales in forward markets are primarily made on a “baseload” basis whereby the seller agrees to

49


-----

deliver a defined amount of electricity on a continuous basis for a season or more. Intermittent generators tend to
only sell a proportion of their predicted output in forward markets due to uncertainty as to weather and other
conditions that impact on their ability to generate. Furthermore, thermal generators using gas and coal are less
likely to deliver baseload electricity than they historically have been due to unfavourable market conditions
(including a higher cost of carbon) such that margins for their output on a baseload basis may be low or negative.
As a result, liquidity in forward markets is reduced and this may make it more difficult for us to sell forward our
electricity as far in advance or in such quantities as we feel is optimal for our business and could therefore
adversely affect our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_UK, EU and other financial regulations may reduce our ability to trade products with financial or derivative_**
**_characteristics._**

We enter into a significant number of derivative transactions to hedge our exposure to foreign currency
exchange risks, commodity price risk and, to a lesser degree, inflation risk and interest rate risk. However, in
recent years we have become subject to UK and EU financial regulations designed to reduce the level of
perceived systemic risk inherent in the markets for financial instruments, commodity derivatives and physical
commodities on which we trade. These regulations include the European Market Infrastructure Regulation
(“EMIR”), which seeks to reduce the risk in trading over-the-counter derivatives by introducing reporting,
collateral and risk mitigation requirements and the Regulation on Energy Market Integrity and Transparency
(“REMIT”), which seeks to prevent insider dealing and market manipulation through increasing transparency in
the electricity and gas markets and the revised Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and accompanying
regulation (together, “MiFID II”), which brings more of our trading within its and EMIR’s scope than the
existing regime, imposes position limits on certain commodities for certain larger market participants and limits
or removes our exemption to trade commodity derivatives as an “ancillary activity” to our business without first
demonstrating that we meet the criteria for the use of the exemption and notifying the same to the FCA on an
annual basis. Further regulatory changes may restrict our ability, or make it more costly for us, to enter into
derivative transactions. Our inability to access these markets due to liquidity issues may have a material adverse
effect on our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

These regulations and other future regulatory changes, including a proposed regulation to amend and update
EMIR, could impose tighter constraints on our ability to trade physical commodities and/or commodity
derivatives without regulator authorisation, increased collateral requirements for the trading of commodities and
position limits in key wholesale commodity markets and impact, directly or indirectly, our ability to hedge
commodity risk and/or sell electricity on a forward basis. We believe that, indirectly, these constraints have
negatively impacted overall market liquidity (which impact may continue or increase) and could result in our
realising reduced revenues and/or incurring higher hedging or balancing costs to achieve our trading objectives.
Our inability to access these markets due to liquidity issues may have a material adverse effect on our business,
operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

The effects of Brexit could also be significant as the Government might no longer be subject to the rulings
of the General Court of the European Union, or subject to the set of EU directives relating to markets for
financial instruments, commodity derivatives and physical commodities. Any change in the Government’s policy
towards financial markets regulation could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, prospects,
financial condition and results of operations. See “—The result of the UK referendum on withdrawal from the EU
_may have a negative effect on economic conditions, financial markets and demand for our products and services,_
_which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition”._

In addition, as the number and complexity of financial regulations affecting us increases, there is a
consequential increase in the cost of compliance and in the risk of non-compliance. Any material failure in this
respect could lead to sanctions, including a restriction on our trading activities, fines and a reduction in the
number of counterparties that are willing to trade with us, all of which could have a material adverse effect on
our business, operations, projects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may fail to secure future Ancillary Services contracts when current key contracts expire, which are an_**
**_important source of revenue for us._**

We actively engage with the System Operator to offer Ancillary Services such as various types of
“frequency response” (altering output to ensure the frequency of electricity in the Transmission System is within
statutory limits) or generating or absorbing “reactive power” (the means by which system voltage is maintained
within acceptable levels). See “Our Business—Power Generation—Ancillary Services and Capacity Market
_Payments”. The provision of these services is an important source of revenue for us, amounting to £18.8 million_

50


-----

in 2018 (compared to £30.7 million in 2017). Following the DGEL Acquisition, the provision of these services is
of increased importance to us, in particular as a result of the Ancillary Service contracts received by the
Cruachan power plant. See “—The earnings of the DGEL Group may be impacted by disruptive technologies in
_an evolving wholesale electricity market”. While we take steps to ensure that we continue to secure Ancillary_
Services contracts, there is a risk that we may fail to win these contracts in the future. In particular, certain
Ancillary Services have traditionally only been provided by conventional flexible generation (coal and gas) and
we may face downside pricing pressures from competitors whose economic conditions necessitate that they
require such contracts in order to avoid closing or else mothballing a plant. Furthermore, Ancillary Services will
also be provided by new market entrants such as wind and battery storage. The loss of or inability to win such
contracts in the future could adversely affect our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results
of operations.

Our Cruachan pumped storage power plant provides Ancillary Services to the System Operator on a serviceby-service basis by mutual agreement, by reference to an agreed pricing schedule. There is no guarantee that the
System Operator will continue to select the Cruachan pumped storage power plant to provide these Ancillary
Services in the future, which could adversely affect our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and
results of operations. See “—The earnings of the DGEL Group may be impacted by disruptive technologies in an
_evolving wholesale electricity market”._

**_The earnings of the DGEL Group may be impacted by disruptive technologies in an evolving wholesale_**
**_electricity market._**

A proportion of the DGEL Group’s earnings are derived from the Cruachan pumped storage power plant’s
provision of Ancillary Services and its wider participation in the balancing market. Such revenues derive from
the fact that pumped storage is the only storage technology that forms a notable proportion of the current UK
wholesale generation mix and is the only storage technology in the UK that is able to discharge a substantial
amount of electricity for significant lengths of time.

There are a number of nascent electricity storage technologies in development across the world (for
example, lithium-ion battery technology) that may, in the future, have the necessary scale and reliability to
compete with pumped storage facilities. Whilst our investment case for the DGEL Acquisition took account of
emerging technologies, should these technologies displace pumped storage earlier or at a greater rate than
anticipated, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_We may become exposed to increased regulatory risk and scrutiny._**

We operate in a highly regulated market subject to detailed legislation and regulation. Following the DGEL
Acquisition, the increased size of our business, and particularly its increased presence in wholesale generation
and the Ancillary Services markets, may lead to increased risk of regulatory scrutiny or risk arising from
regulatory change, as regulators seek to ensure sufficient market liquidity in order to ensure effective price
competition. In particular, some industry regulation and generator licence conditions only apply to larger
generation groups, such as the Secure and Promote licence condition, which requires the largest generators to
provide minimum service standards to small suppliers and imposed a market making obligation on the six largest
vertically integrated companies. Increased regulatory scrutiny may lead to an increased level of obligations and
cost of compliance and may result in actions against us for non-compliance with the regulatory framework. We
may also become increasingly exposed to the impact of changes to the legal or regulatory framework in which
we operate. This could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations
and prospects.

The DGEL Acquisition will increase the breadth of regulatory oversight of the Group. In particular, we are
now subject to regulations on a range of assets (for example, dams, reservoirs and watercourses) that have only
recently come within the purview of the Group. Whilst operational staff have transferred as part of the DGEL
Acquisition, any failure to adapt to, and comply with, the increased regulatory burden or else adequately remedy
any legacy issues with the acquired sites may result in civil or criminal liabilities, including fines or penalties
which, if levied, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. See “—Our business is subject to complex regulation, by the Government, the EU and other
_authorities that has in the past and could in the future materially adversely affect us”._

Further, our B2B Energy Supply segment is the fifth largest non-domestic energy supplier in the UK and the
size of its customer base may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny or unfavourable regulatory change as

51


-----

regulators seek to ensure customer interests are sufficiently protected. Haven Power and Opus are subject to
various supply licence conditions, which impose conditions on their operations in relation to various matters
including continuity of supply, compliance with industry codes and customer relations, including the provision of
certain information to customers. Changes to these licence conditions due to the increased scale of the B2B
Energy Supply segment, or other changes as a result of increased regulatory scrutiny, may lead to an increased
cost of compliance and may result in actions against us for non-compliance with the regulatory framework.

We may also become increasingly exposed to the impact of changes to the legal or regulatory framework in
which we operate. See “—Our business is subject to complex regulation by the Government, the EU and other
_authorities that has in the past and could in the future materially adversely affect us”._

**_New businesses or activities that we undertake alone, or with partners, may not result in positive earnings and_**
**_may expose us to additional operational and financial risk._**

We have in the past from time to time entered into acquisition, disposal or joint venture transactions and
expect to continue to do so. Business development activities, including acquisitions, disposals and joint ventures,
entail a number of risks, including that they may be based on incorrect assumptions or conclusions, a failure to
realise planned levels of synergy and efficiency savings and the inability to integrate acquired businesses
effectively. Any integration of acquired businesses in the future would require significant time and effort on the
part of our management. Integration of new businesses can be difficult and disrupt our own business because our
operational and business culture may differ from the cultures of the businesses we acquire, unpopular costcutting measures may be required and internal controls may be more difficult to maintain. These could result in a
loss of revenue on account of unanticipated costs and liabilities. We may also be liable for the past acts,
omissions or liabilities of companies or businesses that we acquired or developed, which may be unforeseen or
greater than anticipated at the time of the relevant acquisition. In the case of joint ventures, we may have limited
control over operations and our joint venture partners may have interests that diverge from our interests. The
occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business, operations, prospects, financial condition
and results of operations, and could also affect our ability to enter into other transactions.

**_We may not realise, or it may take us longer to realise, the expected benefits of acquisitions and investments,_**
**_including the DGEL Acquisition._**

We may fail to achieve certain or any of the anticipated benefits that we expect to realise as a result of
acquisitions and investments, including the DGEL Acquisition, or it may take longer than expected to realise
those benefits. If the anticipated benefits, such as the anticipated financial returns (including returns from the
expected reinstatement of the Capacity Market), are not achieved, or take longer than expected to be realised, this
could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Achieving the anticipated benefits of acquisition and investments, including the DGEL Acquisition, will
depend, in part, on whether we integrate the DGEL Group in an efficient and effective manner. The integration
process is likely to present administrative, managerial and financial challenges, some of which may not be
identified until after the process is under way. Unforeseen difficulties, costs, liabilities, losses or delays could
adversely affect our business and the realisation of the benefits of acquisitions and investments, including the
DGEL Acquisition. The ongoing integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the
anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realised. Actual synergies, if achieved at all, may be lower
than what we expect and may take longer to achieve than anticipated. If we are not able to adequately address
these challenges, we may not be able to successfully integrate DGEL’s operations into our legacy operations, or
realise the anticipated benefits of the DGEL Acquisition.

Potential difficulties in the integration process include:

   - consolidating and integrating corporate and administrative functions, such as procedures, systems,
accounting functions, compensation structures for transferring staff and other policies;

   - putting in place the necessary new systems and/or processes to enable us to dispatch electricity from (and
where applicable, offtake gas from the gas transmission network to supply) generating assets located
across Great Britain from a central hub;

   - replacing IT infrastructure (notably network connections and certain pieces of hardware at the acquired
generation sites that will be removed or retained by the previous shareholder of DGEL following the
expiry of any transitional arrangements);

   - operating and integrating different technology platforms and systems across our business with a
significantly increased geographical footprint;

52


-----

   - conforming standards (including environmental, health and safety and compliance standards), controls,
business cultures, and policies; and

   - disruption to our ongoing business.

The failure of, or any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with, the integration process could
also lead to reputational damage.

**_The DGEL Acquisition may be reviewed under UK merger control legislation._**

The UK merger control regime applies to the DGEL Acquisition as the DGEL Group’s turnover in its last
audited annual accounts exceeded £70 million and we currently operate an electricity generation business. As a
result, it is possible that the UK Competition and Markets Authority (the “CMA”) may instigate an investigation
into the DGEL Acquisition. Generally, the CMA cannot refer a merger for investigation more than four months
after completion.

The CMA has the power to: (i) impose an order, such as a “hold separate” order that would, among other
things, delay the integration of the Group and the DGEL Group and prevent us from doing anything that might
impair the ability of the DGEL Group to compete independently in any markets affected by the DGEL
Acquisition, pending any decision being made by the CMA; and/or (ii) require remedies as a consequence of the
DGEL Acquisition, such as the divestment by us of certain assets or businesses, the imposition of restrictions on
the conduct of our businesses and/or other behavioural remedies.

We informed the CMA about the DGEL Acquisition in October 2018, and have not subsequently received
any notification from the CMA indicating any intention to give a hold separate order or to start an investigation
in relation to the DGEL Acquisition.

**_Management attention may be diverted from our business by the DGEL Acquisition._**

The DGEL Acquisition has required, and will continue to require, substantial amounts of both time and
focus from our management team, which could adversely affect their ability to operate each respective business
effectively and efficiently. Our management will also be required to devote significant attention and resources to
integrating the DGEL Group within our Power Generation Segment. There is a risk that the challenges associated
with managing the DGEL Acquisition will result in management distraction and that consequently the underlying
businesses will not perform in line with expectations. An inability to realise the full extent of the anticipated
benefits of the DGEL Acquisition, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an
adverse effect upon our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Acquired assets, including those acquired in connection with the DGEL Acquisition, may have liabilities that_**
**_are not known to us._**

As a result of our acquisitions or investments, we may be exposed to certain liabilities that we were unaware
of at the time of the relevant acquisition or investment and other risks associated with such acquisitions or
investments.

The DGEL Group was acquired with certain liabilities, including certain tax liabilities and potential
environmental liabilities. There may be liabilities that we failed or were unable to discover in the course of
performing due diligence investigations into the DGEL Group. Any such undiscovered liabilities of the DGEL
Group, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations,
prospects, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, such liabilities may not be recoverable under
the DGEL Acquisition Agreement. As we integrate the DGEL Group, we may learn additional information about
the DGEL Group that adversely affects us, such as unknown or contingent liabilities and issues relating to
compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

**_The DGEL Acquisition Agreement includes limited protections provided to us by the previous shareholder of_**
**_DGEL._**

The liability of the previous shareholder of DGEL pursuant to the DGEL Acquisition Agreement is limited
by, among other things:

   - a limit on claims under business warranties of 18 months from the date of the DGEL Acquisition
Agreement and a seven-year limit on certain other claims, including, but not limited to, claims under
fundamental warranties (being those warranties relating to Scottish Power Generation Holdings Limited’s

53


-----

legal title to, and capacity and authority to sell, the DGEL shares), property title warranties, tax warranties
and warranties relating to the internal reorganisation undertaken prior to the closing of the DGEL
Acquisition from the date of the DGEL Acquisition Agreement; and

   - an aggregate financial cap of: (i) the purchase price paid by us for fundamental warranties, (ii) 30 per
cent. of the purchase price paid by us for property title warranties and claims and (iii) 20 per cent. of the
purchase price paid by us for all other claims.

The DGEL Acquisition Agreement includes a customary tax covenant from ScottishPower Generation
Holdings to provide protection for us against the pre-completion tax liabilities of the ScottishPower Generation
Group. The tax covenant is subject to customary general limitations, including a cap on all tax covenant claims
set at the purchase price paid by us together with a seven-year time limit for bringing any tax covenant claim.

Accordingly, we may not have recourse against, or otherwise be able to recover from, the previous
shareholder of DGEL in respect of material losses that we may suffer in respect of a breach of warranty or
otherwise in respect of liabilities of the DGEL Group.

If any material liabilities were to arise and were it not possible to make a claim under the warranties or
indemnities in respect thereof, or if any losses could not be fully recovered in respect of claims under the DGEL
Acquisition Agreement, this could adversely affect our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_We are exposed to short-term electricity and gas price volatility, which may result in increased balancing_**
**_costs._**

Our B2B Energy Supply segment’s customer demand for electricity and gas is weather-correlated and, as a
result, short-term changes in customer usage may have an impact on our results. In particular, we may face
higher than average customer demand at times of higher than average prices in the wholesale electricity markets;
there may be times when the selling price to customers that is achieved is lower than the cost of purchasing
energy to supply those customers in the short-term wholesale market. This comes against a background of
generally increasing volatility in the wholesale prompt electricity markets (in which in-day, day-ahead and
weekend electricity and gas products are traded). While we expect to take measures to forecast demand and
hedge accordingly, there is a risk that variances in forecast and actual customer demand may lead to an increase
in balancing costs for us.

**_We rely on access to, and operation of, the transmission and distribution networks that we do not own or_**
**_operate, in order to sell electricity and purchase gas._**

Our B2B Energy Supply segment contracts with third parties that own or operate electricity and gas
transmission or distribution networks to deliver the electricity and gas we sell. We do not own or control the
transmission or distribution facilities. Electricity and gas transmission and distribution lines may experience
unplanned outages over which we have no control. Our energy output may also be curtailed for other reasons
beyond our control. Furthermore, the operators of such networks may not comply with their obligations
pertaining to transmission or distribution or they may withdraw from related agreements. The occurrence of any
of the circumstances detailed above would, to the extent that we are not entitled to receive compensation for the
issue, result in loss of revenue that could adversely affect our business, operations, prospects, financial condition
and results of operations.

In December 2018, Ofgem launched a review of electricity network access and forward-looking charge
arrangements, including in respect of the definition and choice of access rights for transmission and distribution
users, distribution network charges, the distribution connection charging boundary and transmission network
charges. It is expected that any changes arising as a result of this review will be implemented in 2022 and 2023.
Any such changes may affect the cost bases of generators and retailers and could adversely affect our business,
operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our reliance on TPIs and termination of relations with them might have an adverse impact on our reputation_**
**_and operations._**

Opus and (to a lesser extent) Haven Power rely on their relationships with third party intermediaries
(“TPIs”) in order to access new customers and grow their businesses. TPIs, principally brokers, typically
introduce customers to energy suppliers and provide advice on suitable products in exchange for a fee, which is
either charged directly to the customer or else levied via the customer invoice for electricity or gas consumed. As
a result of the Opus Acquisition, we have a significantly larger retail business and the importance of its
relationships with TPIs has significantly increased.

54


-----

Opus’ relationships with TPIs are maintained by members of the Opus management team. The departure of
these employees who are important to relationships with TPIs could lead to the subsequent termination of these
relationships or result in their being less productive. The termination of relationships with key TPIs or a
significant number of TPIs, or any negative reputational impact due to our increased engagement with TPIs,
might have an adverse impact on our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of
operations.

More generally, a significant proportion of both Haven Power’s and Opus’ revenue is generated from sales
via TPIs. The termination of either company’s agreements with TPIs could adversely affect short-term
profitability.

While TPIs are not directly regulated by Ofgem, application of more stringent rules and regulations to TPIs
in the future may render our relationships with TPIs less productive. Our B2B Energy Supply segment’s
engagement with TPIs could expose us to behaviour or practices of TPIs that deviate from the TPI Code of
Practice, which may negatively impact our reputation.

**_We may be unable to pass on a proportion of increased third party costs to customers._**

We are subject to charges that are outside our control in relation to the supply of electricity and gas to
customers (“Third party Charges”). Third party Charges include, but are not limited to, grid charges, together
with charges arising from the RO on electricity suppliers, the SS-FiT, and charges levied on market participants
for the costs of CfDs and the Capacity Market, respectively. Both Haven Power and Opus, in accordance with
market practice, typically pass on some or all of these Third party Charges to customers pursuant to the terms of
some of their customer supply contracts.

The electricity supply industry is expected to experience higher rates of increase in Third party Charges in
the future as a result of the likely continued increase in the proportion of renewable generation in the UK’s
generation mix. There is consequently a risk that we will not be able to pass on the full amount of any such
increases in Third party Charges to customers. This risk is particularly acute in relation to the Opus business,
owing to the fact that Opus has historically passed on its Third party Charges to customers through the
application of small periodic price rises. It is possible, therefore, in circumstances where Third party Charges
increase beyond the allowances made in the Opus contracts or previously passed on, that we will, in respect of
Opus customers, either (i) be unable to successfully pass on the unanticipated portion of Third party Charges; or
(ii) experience a reduced customer base as a result of passing on increased Third party Charges resulting in an
adverse impact on our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

It is also possible that the regulator could determine that smaller business customers should be treated more
like domestic customers and could cap prices or seek to fix profit margins on certain types of electricity supply
contracts with smaller businesses. In such circumstances our B2B Energy Supply segment could be restricted in
its ability to adjust customer’s prices as it does today, which may have an adverse effect on our B2B Energy
Supply segment’s business and results of operations.

**_The retail energy supply markets in which we participate are highly competitive, which could lead to a loss of_**
**_customers, reduced margins or an adverse effect on our growth strategy in our B2B Energy Supply segment._**

We operate in a highly competitive market for retail supply. We are currently exposed to risks arising from
a high level of competition in the market for retail supply from both large established players and smaller new
entrants. As of June 2018, British Gas, EDF Energy, npower, E.ON (which recently demerged to E.ON and
Uniper), Scottish Power and SSE), who had together historically dominated the UK retail market, held less than
70 per cent. market share in the large-scale non-domestic segment, and as of January 2019, together supplied
energy to approximately 75 per cent. of domestic customers in the UK. In recent years, an increasing number of
smaller new entrants have come to the market, which has resulted in increased competition on price, terms and
services offered.

Some of our competitors or potential competitors are or may be larger or better capitalised than us, which
may make it difficult for us to compete effectively. For example, Royal Dutch Shell entered the B2B energy
supply market in 2017. It is possible that our competitors may employ highly competitive strategies, such as
lower or predatory pricing or attempted mergers or corporate transactions such as the proposed transaction
between E.ON, RWE (the majority shareholder in innogy) and innogy (the parent company of npower)
announced in March 2018 in which E.ON will acquire the retail and network businesses of innogy and RWE will
own the combined renewable-generation businesses of E.ON and innogy as well as a stake in E.ON, which may
mean that we are unable to compete effectively, leading to a reduction in profits and market share and an adverse
effect on our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Fluctuations in the demand for and supply of ROCs could result in the revenues we receive from the sale of_**
**_ROCs to third party suppliers being substantially lower than anticipated._**

Our revenue and profitability from biomass and hydro generation depend in part on the value of ROC sale
revenue, which is affected by the ROC buy-out value. ROCs are ultimately used by electricity suppliers who can
submit ROCs in satisfaction of their RO or else pay the buy-out.

Revenues from the external sale of ROCs amounted to £664.5 million, £367.8 million and £366.7 million in
2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. External ROC sales increased significantly in 2018 as a result of a
combination of the increase in market prices and actions taken to accelerate the timing of cash flows from ROCs.
Where we choose to sell ROCs to accelerate cash flows, we may choose to purchase ROCs at a later date to meet
our obligation, leading to an offsetting charge in cost of sales.

The Government regulates the market value of a ROC to a ROC generator through control of the ROC buyout price and through establishing the number of ROCs that each supplier must submit at the end of each
compliance period. When a supplier fails to procure enough ROCs to meet its RO in a compliance period it must
pay the ROC buy-out price for each ROC that it failed to procure. ROCs are typically sold by the generator at a
price equal to the buy-out price less a fee, possibly also with a top-up “recycling amount”. See “—The amount of
_the Ofgem recycle benefit fund payment that will be paid over to us is unpredictable and difficult to forecast”._

The market value of ROCs is only maintained to the extent that the total overall obligation of suppliers to
purchase ROCs is greater than the supply of ROCs in the market. The Government is required to build 10 per
cent. headroom into its calculation of the level of the obligation to protect the market against unexpected
fluctuations in renewable generation. Should the supply of ROCs in the market be higher than suppliers’ overall
obligation in any given compliance period (as a result of overall renewable output being greater than forecast or
demand being lower than expected), then the price paid by suppliers when purchasing ROCs, to the extent that
the oversupply of ROCs is not otherwise “banked” and held by the relevant generator/supplier for use in the
following compliance period, will decrease and the ultimate value realised for a ROC by a generator could be
materially less than our forecasts or than historically realised. The total number of ROCs presented in the UK and
the actual headroom achieved in each of the last five ROC compliance periods is set out in the table below:


**ROCs presented**
**(in million ROCs)**

In an oversupplied market, we may decide to “bank” ROCs and sell them to suppliers for use in the
following compliance year; however, greater price discounting would be likely in the current compliance year.
Banking increases supply and thereby may impact prices in the following compliance year. Any oversupply of
ROCs could therefore adversely affect our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_The amount of the Ofgem recycle benefit fund payment that will be paid over to us is unpredictable and_**
**_difficult to forecast._**

The RO recycle benefit fund is made up of payments from suppliers who have not submitted enough ROCs
to Ofgem to meet their RO for the relevant compliance period and who therefore are required to pay the ROC
buy-out price for each ROC that they failed to procure. Its quantum therefore increases proportionally to the
scarcity of ROCs in any given compliance period. Many of our contracts for the sale of ROCs to suppliers
contain provisions that require the supplier to pay a fixed upfront fee and then an additional fee at a later date
equal to the proportion of the recycle fund that is received by the supplier from Ofgem following submission of
the purchased ROCs.

In recent years it has become more challenging for DBEIS to forecast accurately the number of ROCs that
may be generated in a given compliance period due to the difficulty in predicting exactly when new renewable
plants will come on-stream and the amount of wind and solar electricity generation in any given period. If
renewable output differs materially from DBEIS’s expectations, more or fewer ROCs will have been generated
during the compliance period than forecast, which will affect the level of the recycle payment. Additionally
DBEIS have found it challenging to accurately forecast total demand for each compliance period as shown in the

56


-----

table above under “—Fluctuations in the demand for and supply of ROCs could result in the revenues we receive
_from the sale of ROCs to third party suppliers being substantially lower than anticipated”._

There is, therefore, inherent uncertainty in the amount of recycle benefit to which we will be entitled and,
while we may attempt to hedge our exposure to any fluctuations in the amount of recycle benefit, any significant
fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_Third party Charges mutualisation may affect our results of operations._**

The failure of several small energy suppliers to meet their RO in 2018 led to a shortfall in payments into the
various government schemes where energy suppliers are collectively obligated to pay charges for low carbon
generation and capacity costs, most notably the RO Scheme. In 2018 this led to mutualisation of costs associated
with the RO Scheme and SS-FiT, which increased our cost of sales by £3.9 million for the year ended
31 December 2018. In these circumstances, the remaining energy suppliers are obligated to make up the shortfall.

Further energy supplier failures to pay such costs, including costs associated with the Capacity Market to
the extent that it is reinstated in the future, could lead to further industry cost mutualisation. To the extent that
these increased costs are not mitigated by customer pass throughs or similar solutions, they may adversely affect
our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We operate in a seasonal industry, which may affect our results of operations._**

Demand for electricity is seasonal, with demand and prices generally being higher during the winter months.
Demand for gas in the B2B Energy Supply segment is also dependent on weather, with periods of cold weather
usually resulting in an increase in demand.

In addition, revenue from the sale of ROCs is subject to annual patterns. Generators typically sell ROCs to
suppliers for delivery and payment in the months of June or July following the end of the relevant compliance
period as suppliers need to submit the ROCs to Ofgem by the end of August following the end of the compliance
period. Therefore, the results of a single financial half-year may not be a reliable basis for the expectations of a
full fiscal year and may not be comparable with the results in other financial half-years. See also “—An inability
_to source fuel to the correct technical specification could lead to a reduced output from Drax Power Station”._

**_The performance of our pumped storage and hydro assets could be impacted by unseasonal or extreme_**
**_weather conditions, which may affect our results of operations._**

Following the DGEL Acquisition, the performance of DGEL’s pumped storage and hydro assets could be
impacted by unseasonal or extreme weather conditions. The economic case underpinning the acquisition of the
pumped storage and hydro assets assumes that the assets will be generally capable of being dispatched at times of
peak demand and pricing. However, unseasonal or extreme weather may prevent this. If, for example, droughts
restrict water flows and consequent generation or excess rainfall leads to a need to dispatch the assets at suboptimal times to avoid flooding, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, prospects,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_A failure of, or a malicious attack in relation to, our IT systems could adversely affect our reputation, business_**
**_and results of operations._**

We are highly dependent on our IT systems and networks and our operational performance could be
materially adversely affected by a failure to maintain the health of our IT systems and networks, with inadequate
record keeping, poor control of data and failure to support key technologies being among the key risks.

Attempts may be made to gain unauthorised access to, or deliberately breach, our IT systems in order, for
example, to manipulate our proprietary business data or customer information. Other examples include breaching
of a licence agreement, regulatory requirement or contractual obligation, and even incidents that do not amount
to a breach could result in adverse regulatory and financial consequences, as well as harming our reputation.

In addition to these risks, we may be affected by other potential events that are largely outside our control.
Malicious attacks, including cyber-attacks, may damage our assets, or prevent generation at Drax Power Station
or our other generation facilities (including facilities acquired in connection with the DGEL Acquisition). The
Government has warned of the potential for a large-scale cyber-attack on the UK’s infrastructure and energy
supply from foreign agents. Any cyber-attack on the Group and, in particular, on Drax Power Station could have
wide-ranging and devastating consequences. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business,
operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

57


-----

As our business grows, our information security capability will need to be expanded and improved to
accommodate the businesses’ increasingly complex and demanding requirements. For example, following the
DGEL Acquisition, we now operate multiple IT systems across multiple sites and are taking steps to replace
DGEL’s legacy systems with new systems. Failure to make these improvements in an efficient and timely
manner could have a detrimental impact on our systems or networks availability or efficiency, leading to a
material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Failures of our IT systems for our B2B Energy Supply segment may negatively impact future business_**
**_development and adversely affect our existing customer base._**

Our B2B Energy Supply segment, depends on its IT systems for regulatory compliance, such as the
effective and compliant roll-out of Smart Meters to customers. See “—Our business is subject to complex
_regulation by the Government, the EU and other authorities that has in the past and could in the future_
_materially adversely affect us”._

Our B2B Energy Supply segment is currently replacing the majority of its ageing, complex IT systems with
a new system stack. The first phase of this replacement was completed in 2018. There can be no assurance that
the remaining phases of this process will be completed as planned and we may incur substantial additional costs
in relation to that work. In addition, there can be no assurance that the new IT system will deliver the anticipated
efficiencies and improvements. Any failings in the implementation of the new IT systems or any failings in the
existing IT architecture may adversely affect the customer experience and our ability to comply with regulatory
obligations. Such occurrences may have a material adverse effect on the ability of the B2B Energy Supply
segment to retain and develop its customer base and may adversely affect our business, operations, prospects,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_Failure to comply with data protection legislation or the disclosure of customer and employee data could_**
**_result in significant harm to us._**

Our B2B Energy Supply segment requires access to customer personal data and/or special category personal
data. Examples of such data include information identifying a person as a customer by reference to an identifier
such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to
the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that person. In the ordinary
course of business, we also collect, transmit and store employee data, including dates of birth and medical
information as well as contact data of vendors.

Our use of this personal data is subject to laws, regulations and guidance designed to protect personal data
that a business processes, including, among others, the EU-wide General Data Protection Regulation (the
“GDPR”), which came into force on 25 May 2018 and was substantively transposed into UK law by the Data
Protection Act 2018 (the “DPA”), which imposes significant compliance obligations. The GDPR implements
more stringent operational requirements for controllers and processors of personal data than the previous
legislative framework, including, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be
used. The Information Commissioner’s Office (the “Regulator”) now has the ability to impose larger fines of up
to €20 million or up to 4 per cent. of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year,
whichever is higher. Privacy is a fundamental human right and individuals are more likely to complain or bring a
claim over misuse of their personal data.

If a significant or widely publicised unlawful disclosure of employee or customer data were to occur,
whether as a result of a failure of our IT security systems, employee negligence or wilful act or the actions of our
vendors, the reputation of our B2B Energy Supply segment may be adversely affected, employee, customer or
investor confidence may be diminished and we may be subject to legal claims by individuals, fines or other
enforcement action by the Regulator. Company directors can also be disqualified following material breaches.
Additionally, individuals who are the subject of the personal data have much more control over their personal
data under the GDPR and if there is a failure to accommodate the exercise of their expanded individual rights,
then similar consequences could flow from such failures.

**_Our inability to attract, train or retain appropriately qualified personnel could adversely affect our business._**

Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees and contractors. The
need for such employees is particularly enhanced in light of the current pace of strategic change we are
experiencing. The unplanned departure of any of our executive officers or key employees could have a negative
impact on our operations, including possibly adversely affecting our ability to provide the service levels our
customers expect.

58


-----

This risk is particularly true with respect to electricity regulation and the renewable energy industry.
Electricity regulation and trading is a highly specialised field with a limited pool of qualified and experienced
personnel while the renewable energy industry is a highly specialised and relatively new industry and, as a result,
there is a limited pool of technically qualified personnel, particularly outside London. We compete with a
number of companies as well as Government entities and other organisations for such personnel and,
consequently, we have encountered and may continue to encounter difficulties in retaining certain key employees
and attracting new personnel. Any such difficulty in retaining and/or attracting key personnel could have a
material adverse effect on our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

Certain of our generation assets, and in particular certain of the generation assets acquired as part of the
DGEL Acquisition, are in remote locations and require employees with sufficient technical engineering and
operational expertise to maintain and operate them safely and optimally. Whilst operational staff have transferred
as part of the DGEL Acquisition, there can be no certainty that such staff will continue to work for us in the
longer term, and it may prove difficult to find adequately skilled replacements.

Separately, the new multi-site, multi-fuel generation model operated by the Group following the DGEL
Acquisition will require an adequate number of sufficiently qualified employees to dispatch the larger and more
complex portfolio of assets optimally. Energy trading on this scale is a highly specialised field and it may be
difficult for us to retain or attract the personnel required.

**_We are dependent on good working relations with our employees, unions and employee representatives to_**
**_avoid business interruptions or amend collective bargaining agreements._**

As of 31 December 2018, approximately 61 per cent. of our employees in the Power Generation segment
(including DGEL employees) were covered by collective bargaining arrangements. If we were to make any
changes to the terms of employment of any of our employees or to terminate employment agreements of our
employees and our employees were to react adversely to such changes or terminations, we may face labour
disputes or work stoppages at Drax Power Station. The operations at Drax Power Station have not recently been
adversely affected by disputes with employees, contractors or trade unions. However, we can give no assurance
that future industrial action may not disrupt our operations. For example, we are currently in pay negotiations
with Drax Power Station employees subject to collective bargaining arrangements. Our initial offer has been
rejected and union representatives are currently engaging with members to gauge the level of support there would
be for industrial action should they progress to a formal industrial action ballot.

**_We may suffer damages as a result of our employees or agents acting outside applicable law or regulation or_**
**_our policies and procedures._**

We may suffer damage if an employee or someone acting on our behalf, for example a TPI, breaches our
internal controls or internal governance framework or contravenes applicable laws and regulations. Such breach
or circumvention may include, for example, inadvertent or careless mistakes or intentional acts or
misrepresentations by our employees or agents, breaches of applicable laws or regulations in the course of their
duties, breaches of operational guidelines or other improper acts. Any such misconduct could have an impact on
our reputation and our relationship with our regulators and other stakeholders or lead to regulatory or legal
action, which in turn could adversely affect our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of
operations.

The customers, suppliers, financial institutions, contractors and other third parties that we do business with
may not fulfil their obligations to us and may expose us to credit and operational risks, which could adversely
affect our financial position.

_Credit Risk_

We purchase from and sell commodities to a range of counterparties in a number of different countries.
Collateral is not required from all counterparties and the failure of one or more of these counterparties to perform
its contractual obligations might lead to reduced profits for us or result in our incurring additional costs in
replacing the relevant transactions. We may also find ourselves unable to procure or sell replacement
commodities elsewhere.

Excluding revenues derived from our CfD, we derived revenues of £555.8 million and £240.7 million in
2018 (£319.8 million and £289.0 million in 2017) from our top two external customers in the Power Generation
segment, representing 17 per cent. and 7 per cent. of our consolidated revenue in 2018, respectively. A default by
one of these customers could lead to such customer failing to make a substantial payment to us, thereby causing a
loss of revenue and adversely affecting our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of
operations.

59


-----

The failure of one or more of the large customers in our B2B Energy Supply segment (who are generally not
required to deliver collateral in respect of their contractual obligations) may lead to bad debts and, consequently,
reduced profits for us, particularly if the electricity or gas then needs to be sold in the market at a lower price
than that previously contracted.

We are also exposed to the credit risk of banks that hold our deposits and of financial counterparties with
whom we hedge foreign exchange, commodity price, interest rate or inflation rate exposures. Our foreign
exchange exposures are routinely hedged in line with our hedging policy and so any default or insolvency of a
counterparty could lead to a failure by such counterparty to make termination payments payable to us and an
inability to obtain sufficient replacement currency to enable us to meet our liabilities in a particular jurisdiction
on a timely basis.

_Operational Counterparty Risk_

The nascent nature of the biomass supply market means that our third party biomass suppliers do not have
the same financial strength as our coal suppliers. There is an increased risk that these biomass suppliers may
default on their supply obligations and, in such circumstances, the potential for us to recover our losses as a result
of a supplier default may be limited.

**_We are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk and our business and results of operations may be_**
**_negatively affected by fluctuation of different currencies._**

Our business is subject to risks due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Most of the biomass we
purchase is priced in US dollars, Canadian dollars or euro. Changes in the relative value of the US dollar,
Canadian dollar or euro, or relative to other currencies (including the pound sterling), may increase our suppliers’
cost of business and ultimately our cost of goods sold with respect to biomass. As such, our failure or inability to
hedge currency exchange rate risks within our expected five-year hedging period (see “Our Business—Power
_Generation—Trading sustainable biomass units”) or fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates beyond this_
period could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

During 2018, the pound sterling depreciated significantly against the US dollar, in part due to uncertainty
around the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union, largely reversing the gains in the value of the pound
sterling relative to the US dollar in 2017. To the extent unhedged, any further weakening of pound sterling
associated with Brexit would increase the currency exchange rate risk which we face, which could adversely
affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. For further details, see “—The result of the UK
_referendum on withdrawal from the EU may have a negative effect on economic conditions, financial markets_
_and demand for our products and services, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of_
_operations and financial condition”._

**_Our financial models may be flawed and inaccurate._**

We use a number of financial models to manage our business and there is a risk that the financial models
used by us to calculate important information such as generation forecasts and fuel pricing models, optimisation
of fuel deliveries and infrastructure investment may produce inaccurate information. This could be due to a
model itself being incorrect or corrupted, or the assumptions that we use in a model being inaccurate. Such
failures could adversely affect our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our insurance policies may not provide cover for all losses incurred and we may not be able to maintain the_**
**_same level of insurance cover in the future._**

Our operations are subject to various hazards common to the industry, such as explosions, fire, severe
weather conditions, toxic emissions and equipment breakdowns. This risk is particularly acute because most of
our revenue and gross profit for 2018 was derived from the sale of electricity produced from biomass generation
and the subsidies related thereto (in the form of ROCs earned by Drax Power Station or CfD payments). As
protection against operating hazards, we maintain insurance cover against some, but not all, of the potential
losses which may arise. There is no assurance that catastrophic or other events relating to uninsured or
uninsurable risks will not occur. Furthermore, if we suffer a loss in relation to an insured risk, there is no
guarantee that the amount of insurance protection to which we would be contractually entitled will be sufficient
to cover the entire loss incurred. Insurance, warranties or performance guarantees may not cover all or any lost
revenues or increased expenses from business interruptions or other events. If we suffer an uninsured or
underinsured loss, this could adversely affect our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results
of operations.

60


-----

In November 2018 we agreed a £26 million settlement in respect of insurance claims in respect of (i) a
longer than anticipated planned outage of one of our biomass-fired generation units in the second half of 2016,
(ii) a pressure excursion on one of our biomass storage silos in October 2016, (iii) an unplanned outage in respect
of one of Drax Power Station’s biomass-fired generation units in the second half of 2016, (iv) an incident in
respect of the biomass rail unloading system at Drax Power Station in December 2017 and (v) an unplanned
outage in respect of one of Drax Power Station’s biomass-fired generation units in February 2018.

We are investigating potential insurance claims in respect of an unplanned outage at Shoreham power
station and an incident at one of our Pellet Production segment’s biomass production facilities. We are assessing
whether to make a claim under insurances in respect of these incidents. There can be no assurances that we will
proceed to make any such claims nor, in the event that we made any such claims, that they would be successful.

Insurance cover for particular risks or limits of indemnity may not continue to be available on commercially
reasonable terms or cost. It is possible that in the future insurance providers may no longer wish to insure
businesses in the biomass or coal industry against certain risks, or may charge generators significantly higher
premiums for such cover. Moreover, if one of our operating facilities were to suffer an insured loss, the insurance
proceeds received by us might not be sufficient to cover the business loss, or to repair and reinstate the affected
facilities, or to satisfy liabilities to third parties. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance
could adversely affect our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may be required to pay increased pension contributions to our pension schemes in the future._**

We maintain a variety of pension schemes, including a defined benefit scheme. We and our pension scheme
trustees aim to meet the defined benefit liabilities from cash contributions from Drax Power, the sponsoring
company, in respect of ongoing benefit accrual and deficit repair contributions, and with a portfolio of
investments. These investments give rise to associated risks relating to interest rates, inflation, returns on assets
and the longevity of scheme members and a mismatch between asset and liability value movements as a
consequence of targeting higher returns than those available from assets effectively matching the liabilities. The
defined benefit scheme’s investment portfolio contains a proportion of assets that are expected to provide a better
return in the long term than alternative investments such as bonds; however, in the short term, the difference
between the value of liabilities and assets may vary significantly, potentially resulting in an increase in the
funding requirements.

The current business environment, with low long-term interest rates, long-term gilt yields, corporate bond
yields, equity values and credit spreads, could also affect the value of the deficit having to be recognised.
Furthermore, a quicker than expected increase in life expectancy and/or employee pensionable salaries increasing
above the rates assumed in the previous scheme valuation could be expected to increase the defined benefit
liabilities. Further changes in the accounting standards relating to defined benefit pension liabilities could also
lead to an increasing deficit arising in our defined benefit pension scheme. As of 31 December 2018, our defined
benefit pension scheme had a surplus of £18.9 million (compared to a deficit of £1.2 million as of 31 December
2017). As of 31 December 2018, a decrease of 0.25 per cent. in the discount rate or an increase of 0.25 per cent.
in the inflation rate would have resulted in a decrease in our net surplus under the defined benefit scheme of
£15.2 million and an increase of £13.6 million, respectively. Also, as of 31 December 2018, an increase in life
expectancy by one year would have resulted in a decrease in our net surplus under the defined benefit pension
scheme of £9.2 million.

Our defined benefit pension scheme is subject to triennial actuarial valuations, with the next valuation
scheduled for the first half of 2019. The level of funding deficit calculated at the time could, subject to agreement
between us and the pension scheme trustees, result in additional deficit repair contributions being required or
possibly our offering more contingent assets or asset-backed contributions as further security. Any requirement
to make significant immediate cash contributions into our defined benefit scheme to cover any such deficit could
adversely affect our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. The trustees of
the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme (the “Pension Trustees”) currently benefit from second-ranking
security over the Collateral (other than the Scottish Collateral). We anticipate granting the Pension Trustees
second-ranking security over the Scottish Collateral on or after the Issue Date. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Pension Trustee Priority Deed”._

Upon completion of the DGEL Acquisition, certain employees with defined benefit pension rights were
transferred to the Group. These employees continue to participate in the ScottishPower pension scheme whilst we
set up a new pension scheme for these employees to transfer to, which will include assets and liabilities for past
service benefits. Our share of the ScottishPower pension scheme assets and liabilities for these employees results
in a pension scheme surplus of £3.8 million.

61


-----

Unanticipated actions by the pension regulator and/or any material revisions to existing pensions legislation
could require accelerated and increased contributions to our defined benefit scheme which may restrict our
financial flexibility. The pension scheme trustees could also seek accelerated and increased contributions should
we plan to make material disposals or else fail to comply with certain financial covenants when raising additional
debt. This could adversely affect our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_We may become involved in legal proceedings which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation,_**
**_financial condition, results of operation and cash flows._**

We may become involved in a variety of legal proceedings based on, for example, environmental, health
and safety issues, land use and other matters. These may include complaints and statutory nuisance actions and
claims by third parties based on their common law rights. Such complaints and actions may be related to issues
such as personal injury, property damage, trespass, odour, emission and other such nuisances at our power
stations, wood pellet manufacturing facility sites or biomass-from-waste facility. These types of lawsuits are
often lengthy and can be expensive to defend. A successful third party claim could materially hinder our
operations, prejudice our reputation and result in the imposition of penalties or substantial damages.

**_Changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax position could adversely affect our results of operations and_**
**_financial condition._**

We are subject to complex tax laws. Changes in tax laws could adversely affect our tax position, including
our effective tax rate or tax payments. We often rely on generally available interpretations of applicable tax laws
and regulations. There cannot be certainty that the relevant tax authorities are in agreement with our
interpretation of these laws. If our tax position is challenged by the relevant tax authorities, the imposition of
additional taxes could require us to pay taxes that we currently do not collect or pay or increase the costs of our
services to track and collect such taxes, which could increase our costs of operations or our effective tax rate. The
occurrence of any of the foregoing tax risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations,
prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**RISKS RELATED TO THE NEW NOTES, THE GUARANTEES AND OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE**

**_The Collateral may not be sufficient to secure the obligations under the New Notes._**

The New Notes and the Guarantees will be secured by security interests in the Collateral described in this
Offering Memorandum, which Collateral also secures the obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the
2022 Notes, the Initial Notes, the 2018 Bridge Facility Agreement and certain hedging obligations (including our
obligations under the Secured Trading Line). Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, our
obligations under the Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations (including our obligations under the
Secured Trading Line) will have priority to the New Notes, the 2022 Notes, the Initial Notes and the 2018 Bridge
Facility with respect to the application of the proceeds from any enforcement action over the Collateral and
certain distressed disposals of the Collateral. The Collateral may also secure additional debt or other obligations
with such priority to or ranking pari passu with the New Notes to the extent permitted by the terms of the
Indenture, the 2022 Indenture, the 2018 Bridge Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement. As such, in
the event of a foreclosure of the Collateral, you may not be able to recover on the Collateral if the then
outstanding claims under the Senior Facilities or such other credit facility and such secured hedging obligations
(including outstanding claims under the Secured Trading Line) are greater than the proceeds realised. Any
proceeds from an enforcement sale of the Collateral by any creditor will, after all obligations under the Senior
Facilities or such other credit facility and such secured hedging obligations (including the obligations under the
Secured Trading Line) have been discharged from such recoveries, be applied pro rata in repayment of the New
Notes and any other debt or obligations then outstanding secured by the Collateral entitled to be repaid with the
proceeds thereof on a pari passu basis (including the 2022 Notes, the Initial Notes and the 2018 Bridge Facility).

No appraisals have been prepared by or on our behalf in connection with the issuance of the Initial Notes or
the New Notes. The fair market value of the Collateral and the amount able to be realised upon an enforcement of
such Collateral will depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an
orderly sale, general economic conditions, the availability of buyers, whether or not our business is sold as a
going concern, the jurisdiction in which the enforcement action or sale is completed, the ability to readily
liquidate the Collateral and the fair market value and condition of the Collateral. The book value of the Collateral
should not be relied on as a measure of realisable value for such assets. All or a portion of the Collateral may be
illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, we cannot assure you that there will be a

62


-----

market for the sale of the Collateral or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay during
liquidation. In addition, the share pledges or charges of an entity may be of no value if that entity is subject to an
insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding.

To the extent that security interests and other rights granted to other parties that are not a party to the
Intercreditor Agreement encumber assets owned by the Issuer or Guarantors that do not comprise the Collateral,
those parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to their security
interests or other rights that could adversely affect the value of that Collateral and the ability of the Security
Agent, the Trustee or holders of the Notes to realise the value of or enforce that Collateral. For example, the
trustees of our defined benefit pension scheme have been granted second-ranking security over the Collateral
(other than the Scottish Collateral). We anticipate granting the Pension Trustees second-ranking security over the
Scottish Collateral on or after the Issue Date. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Pension
_Trustee Priority Deed”. Although as of 31 December 2018, our defined benefit pension scheme had a surplus of_
£18.9 million, our defined benefit pension scheme has had, and could in the future have, a deficit. The Pension
Trustees, who are not party to the Intercreditor Agreement, have entered into certain contractual arrangements
with DGHL pursuant to which, among other things, they undertook not to enforce their second-ranking security
without the Security Agent’s consent prior to the discharge of the 2022 Notes, the Initial Notes and certain other
indebtedness secured over the Collateral (including the New Notes). If the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are
not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the New Notes, holders of the New Notes (to the extent not repaid
from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only an unsecured claim against the Issuer’s and
(assuming that the relevant Guarantees have not been released) the Guarantors’ remaining assets. Each of these
factors or any challenge to the validity of the Collateral or the Intercreditor Agreement could reduce the proceeds
realised upon enforcement of the Collateral.

The Senior Facilities Agreement, the 2018 Bridge Facility Agreement, the 2022 Indenture and the Indenture
permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favour of the holders of the New Notes on the Collateral.
To the extent that holders of other secured debt or third parties enjoy liens, including statutory liens, such holders
or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral that, if exercised, could reduce the
proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the New Notes. Moreover, if we issue additional notes under
the 2022 Indenture or further additional notes under the Indenture, holders of such additional notes would benefit
from the same Collateral as the holders of the relevant New Notes being offered hereby (and the 2022 Notes and
the Initial Notes), thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the Collateral for the New Notes.

**_The value of the Collateral may decrease because of wear and tear, obsolescence, impairment or certain_**
**_casualty events._**

The value of the assets serving as Collateral for the New Notes may be adversely affected by normal wear
and tear, obsolescence, impairment or because of certain events that may cause damage to these assets. The
Issuer and the Guarantors will not be required to improve the Collateral. Furthermore, the value of the Collateral
is significantly influenced by the usefulness of the assets serving as Collateral for our business operations. If any
of the assets serving as Collateral were to become obsolete, for example as a result of new technological
standards or changes in the applicable regulatory regime, this would have a significant negative impact on the
value of the relevant Collateral.

On account of the nature of our operations, the Collateral is subject to the risk of certain casualty events.
The proceeds of any insurance taken out with respect to the Collateral may not be sufficient to rebuild or restore
such properties to their original condition prior to the occurrence of the events that caused the insured damages.
In addition, there are certain events that are either not insurable or not economically insurable.

**_The rights of holders of the New Notes in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect_**
**_security interests in the Collateral._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly
perfected, and priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the
security. The liens on the Collateral securing the New Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of
the New Notes if we fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens. Furthermore,
neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent will have any obligation to take any steps or action to perfect any such
security interest. Absent perfection, the Security Agent, on behalf of the holders of New Notes, may have
difficulty enforcing or be entirely unable to enforce rights in the Collateral in competition with third parties,
including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same collateral.

63


-----

**_The granting or the release and retake of the security interests in the Collateral may create hardening periods_**
**_for such security interests in accordance with the law applicable in certain jurisdictions._**

The granting of new security interests in connection with the issuance of the New Notes may create
hardening periods for such security interests in certain jurisdictions. Furthermore, the Indenture permits the
Issuer, DGHL and the other Guarantors to retake and release security over the Collateral in certain
circumstances, including in connection with the incurrence of future indebtedness and the transfer of Collateral
within the Group. The applicable hardening period for any new security interests will run as from the moment
each new security interest has been granted or re-granted, perfected or recreated. At each time, if the security
interest granted, re-granted, perfected or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening
period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void and/or it may not be possible to enforce it.

**_The security over the Collateral will not be granted directly to the holders of the New Notes._**

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the Issuer’s obligations under the New Notes and the
obligations of the Guarantors under the Guarantees will not be granted directly to the holders of the New Notes,
but have been or will be granted only in favour of the Security Agent. The Trustee for the New Notes is party to
the Intercreditor Agreement between, among others, the Security Agent and creditors or representatives of the
creditors of the other indebtedness secured by the Collateral, including the Senior Facilities, the 2022 Notes, the
Initial Notes, the 2018 Bridge Facility and the counterparties to certain hedging obligations (including the
obligations under the Secured Trading Line). Other creditors may become parties to the Intercreditor Agreement
in the future. Among other things, the Intercreditor Agreement governs the enforcement of the Security
Documents, the sharing in any recoveries from such enforcement and the release of the Collateral by the Security
Agent. As a consequence, holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to
take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the New Notes, except through the Security Agent,
who will follow instructions as set forth under the caption “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement”. In addition, in certain circumstances, lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement_
will have the right to direct the Security Agent in enforcement actions with respect to the Collateral.

**_Creditors under the Senior Facilities, certain hedging obligations (including the obligations under the_**
**_Secured Trading Line) and other priority debt are entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral sold_**
**_in any enforcement sale in priority to the New Notes._**

The New Notes and the Guarantees will be secured initially on a first-priority basis by the same Collateral
securing the obligations under the Senior Facilities, the 2022 Notes, the Initial Notes, the 2018 Bridge Facility
and certain hedging obligations (including the obligations under the Secured Trading Line). In addition, under the
terms of the Indenture, 2022 Indenture and the 2018 Bridge Facility Agreement, we are permitted to incur
significant additional indebtedness and other obligations that may be secured by the same Collateral and that may
be entitled to be repaid with the proceeds thereof on a priority or pari passu basis, including other credit facilities
and certain hedging obligations.

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, creditors under the Senior Facilities and any other super priority
indebtedness (subject to the incurrence of additional indebtedness permitted by the Indenture, the 2022 Indenture
and the 2018 Bridge Facility Agreement) and certain hedging obligations (including the obligations under the
Secured Trading Line) are entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in any enforcement sale
or certain distressed disposals in priority to the New Notes (and the 2022 Notes, the Initial Notes and the 2018
Bridge Facility). See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”. As a result,
the claims of the holders of the New Notes will be effectively subordinated to the rights of our existing and future
secured creditors who have priority in respect of the proceeds from enforcement of the liens over assets that
constitute Collateral to the extent of the value of such assets. As such, in the event of a foreclosure of the
Collateral, holders of the New Notes may not be able to recover on the Collateral if the then outstanding claims
under the Senior Facilities Agreement, any such other priority indebtedness and such secured hedging obligations
(including the obligations under the Secured Trading Line) are greater than the proceeds realised. Any proceeds
from an enforcement sale of the Collateral by any creditor will, after all obligations under the Senior Facilities,
any such other priority indebtedness and such secured hedging obligations (including the obligations under the
Secured Trading Line) have been discharged from such recoveries, be applied pro rata in repayment of the New
Notes and any other obligations then outstanding secured by the Collateral that are entitled to be repaid with the
proceeds thereof on a pari passu basis (including the 2022 Notes, the Initial Notes and the 2018 Bridge Facility).
To the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is secured by the Collateral and that may be entitled to be

64


-----

repaid with the proceeds thereof on a priority or pari passu basis with the New Notes, the recoveries in respect of
the proceeds of the Collateral by holders of New Notes will be diluted commensurate with the amount of
indebtedness we incur.

**_Holders of the New Notes will not control decisions regarding the Collateral in certain circumstances._**

The Trustee under the Indenture governing the Notes is a party to the Intercreditor Agreement between,
among others, the agent under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the facility agent under the 2018 Bridge Facility
Agreement, the note trustee for the 2022 Notes, the counterparties under the Secured Trading Line, certain other
Hedge Counterparties and the Security Agent. Other creditors may become parties to the Intercreditor Agreement
or we may enter into additional intercreditor agreements in the future. Among other things, the Intercreditor
Agreement governs the enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral, the sharing in any recoveries from
such enforcement and the release of the Collateral by the Security Agent.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent, who also serves as the security agent for the
lenders under the Senior Facilities, the lenders under the 2018 Bridge Facility, the holders of the 2022 Notes, the
holders of the Initial Notes, the counterparties under the Secured Trading Line, certain other Hedge
Counterparties and holders of any permitted future shared security indebtedness, will act to enforce the security
interest in the Collateral and take instructions from the secured creditors in respect of the Collateral only as
provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement.

The provisions governing enforcement of the Collateral are described in “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Restrictions on Enforcement and Permitted Enforcement”._

The arrangements regarding enforcement of the Collateral could be disadvantageous to the holders of the
New Notes in a number of respects. For example, other creditors not party to the Intercreditor Agreement could
commence enforcement action against the Issuer, DGHL or its subsidiaries prior to any action taken by the
Security Agent, the Issuer, DGHL or one or more of its subsidiaries could seek protection under applicable
bankruptcy laws, or the value of certain Collateral could otherwise be impaired or reduced in value. For example,
the trustees of the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme have been granted second-ranking security over the
Collateral (other than the Scottish Collateral). We anticipate granting the Pension Trustees second-ranking
security over the Scottish Collateral on or after the Issue Date. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Pension Trustee Priority Deed”. Although, as of 31 December 2018, our defined benefit pension_
scheme had a surplus of £18.9 million, our defined benefit pension scheme has had, and could in the future, have
a deficit. The Pension Trustees, who are not party to the Intercreditor Agreement, have entered into certain
contractual arrangements with DGHL pursuant to which, among other things, they undertook not to enforce their
second-ranking security without the Security Agent’s consent prior to the discharge of the 2022 Notes, the Initial
Notes and certain other indebtedness secured over the Collateral (including the New Notes).

In addition, the holders of the Notes will not comprise the majority of the senior secured creditors for the
purposes of instructing the Security Agent. Further, if the obligations of the super priority creditors have not been
satisfied within six months of the date any proposed enforcement instruction is first given to the Security Agent,
control of the enforcement proceedings will shift to the super priority creditors. The lenders under the Senior
Facilities Agreement, the counterparties under the Secured Trading Line, certain other Hedge Counterparties and
lenders or creditors of future classes of debt that are permitted to share the security granted in favour of the Notes
(subject to the 2022 Indenture and the Indenture) may have interests that are different from the interest of the
holders of the New Notes and may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue remedies
under the Security Documents at a time or in a manner that is not supported by the holders of the New Notes. In
connection with the enforcement of the Collateral or certain distressed disposals of the Collateral, the Collateral
and the guarantees of the New Notes may be released in circumstances where the holders of the New Notes do
not recover any proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral or such distressed disposal proceeds or recover
only a limited amount of proceeds.

Delays in enforcement could decrease or eliminate recovery values. In addition, the holders of the New
Notes will not have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Security Documents or to
exercise any rights or powers arising under the Security Documents, except through the Security Agent as
provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting the New Notes, holders of the New Notes will be deemed
to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the New Notes will have limited
remedies and recourse against the Issuer and the Guarantors in the event of a default. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”._

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the New Notes under which the Collateral_**
**_securing the New Notes and the Guarantees will be released automatically, without the consent of the holders_**
**_of the New Notes or the consent of the Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the Collateral securing the New Notes will be released automatically,
including:

   - in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to (i) a person that is not DGHL or a
Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to “Description of Notes—Certain
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”), if such sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant_
described under “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary
_Stock” or (ii) DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary, provided that, in the case of (ii) after giving pro forma_
effect to such release, the relevant Collateral will become promptly subject to a substantially equivalent
lien in favour of the Security Agent securing the New Notes;

   - in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Note Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Indenture,
the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

   - in respect of any Collateral, automatically, without any action by the Trustee, if the lien granted in favour
of the Senior Facilities Agreement in respect of such Collateral is released (only to the extent that there is
no other indebtedness secured by a lien on the assets constituting such Collateral that would result in the
requirement for the New Notes and/or the Note Guarantees to be secured on such property or assets
pursuant to the covenant described under “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitations on
_Liens”, it being understood that the foregoing limitation will not be applicable to the extent that such_
indebtedness is secured by a permitted lien, except to the extent such lien is a permitted lien solely
because it was existing on the issue date with respect to the Initial Notes or secures indebtedness incurred
to refinance indebtedness that was previously so secured);

   - as described under “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Amendments and Waivers”;

   - upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or legal defeasance,
covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided under “Description of
_Notes—Certain Covenants—Defeasance” and “Description of Notes—Satisfaction and Discharge”;_

   - if DGHL designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such
Unrestricted Subsidiary;

   - in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, including
upon an enforcement action;

   - in connection with the granting of liens on such property or assets, which may include Collateral, or the
sale of such property or assets, which may include Collateral, pursuant to a Qualified Receivables
Financing (as defined under “Description of Notes—Certain Definitions”);

   - as permitted by the covenant described under “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—No Impairment
_of Security Interest”;_

   - to release and/or re-take any lien on any Collateral to the extent otherwise permitted by the terms of the
Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, including as part of any Permitted Reorganisation;

   - pursuant to the second paragraph of the covenant described under “Description of Notes—Certain
_Covenants—Limitations on Liens”; or_

   - as otherwise permitted under the Indenture.

See “Description of Notes—Security—Release of Liens”.

Under various circumstances, the Subsidiary Guarantees will be released automatically, including:

   - upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital Stock of the
relevant Subsidiary Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company) or the sale or other
disposition (including by way of a consolidation or merger) of all or substantially all the assets of the
Subsidiary Guarantor, if the sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under
“Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” and the
Subsidiary Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary of DGHL as a result of the sale or other
disposition;

66


-----

   - upon written notice from DGHL to the Trustee, so long as no event of default under the Indenture, has
occurred and is continuing; provided that prior to or substantially concurrently with such release, such
Subsidiary Guarantor is unconditionally released and discharged from its liabilities, if any, with respect to
the Senior Facilities Agreement, and the 2022 Notes, as applicable; provided further that, after giving
effect to such release, the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation calculated on the
same basis as Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the 2022 Indenture) attributable to the Guarantors
(determined separately for each Guarantor and excluding all intra-group items and investments in
Subsidiaries of DGHL and its Restricted Subsidiaries) is at least 80 per cent. of the Consolidated
EBITDA (as defined in the 2022 Indenture) of DGHL and its Restricted Subsidiaries and the aggregate
gross assets of the Guarantors (calculated on an unconsolidated basis and excluding all intra-group items,
goodwill and investments in Subsidiaries of DGHL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) is at least 80% of
the Total Assets (as defined in the 2022 Indenture) (excluding goodwill) of DGHL and its Restricted
Subsidiaries, in each case, calculated in accordance with, and in the manner provided by and subject to
the same exceptions as those set forth in, the relevant provisions of the 2022 Indenture as in effect on the
issue date with respect to the Initial Notes;

   - upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary;

   - upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or legal defeasance,
covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture, as described under “Description of
_Notes—Certain Covenants—Defeasance” and “Description of Notes—Satisfaction and Discharge”;_

   - in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, including
upon an enforcement action;

   - as described under “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Amendments and Waivers”;

   - as described in the covenant described under “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Additional
_Guarantees”;_

   - upon written notice from DGHL to the Trustee, so long as no event of default under the Indenture is
continuing; provided that, after giving pro forma effect to such release, DGHL and its Restricted
Subsidiaries are in compliance with the covenant described under “Description of Notes—Certain
_Covenants—Additional Guarantees”;_

   - as a result of any transaction permitted by the covenant described under “Description of Notes—Certain
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”; or_

   - in connection with a Permitted Reorganisation.

Under various circumstances, the Guarantee of DGHL will be released automatically, including:

   - upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or legal defeasance,
covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture, as provided in “Description of
_Notes—Certain Covenants—Defeasance” and “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Satisfaction_
_and Discharge”;_

   - in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, including
upon an enforcement action;

   - as described under “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Amendments and Waivers”;

   - as a result of any transaction permitted by “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Merger and
_Consolidation”; or_

   - in connection with a Permitted Reorganisation.

**_The Issuer, the Guarantors and Drax Group plc will have control over the Collateral securing the New Notes,_**
**_and the sale of particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the New Notes._**

The Security Documents governing the Collateral will allow the Issuer, the Guarantors and Drax Group plc
to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any
income from the Collateral securing the New Notes. So long as no default or event of default under the Indenture

67


-----

would result therefrom, the Issuer, the Guarantors and Drax Group plc may, among other things, without any
release or consent by the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral, such as
selling, factoring, securitisation, abandoning or otherwise disposing of Collateral and making ordinary course
cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness.

**_The Issuer is a special purpose finance subsidiary of DGHL with no business operations and will depend on_**
**_cash from Drax Corporate Limited and Drax Corporate Limited’s direct and indirect subsidiaries to be able to_**
**_make payments on the New Notes._**

The Issuer is a special purpose finance subsidiary of DGHL and was formed for the purposes of issuing
notes and lending the proceeds on to the DGHL Group. The Issuer has no subsidiaries and conducts no business
operations of its own and has no material assets other than its rights and claims under intercompany financings
(including under the 2022 Notes Proceeds Loan, the Initial Notes Proceeds Loan and, on and from the Issue Date,
the New Proceeds Loan). The Issuer’s ability to make payments pursuant to the Notes and Guarantees is
therefore dependent on the interest or other payments it receives pursuant to the New Proceeds Loan. If Drax
Corporate Limited (or any successor borrower) does not make payments under the New Proceeds Loan for
whatever reason, the Issuer does not expect to have any other sources of funds available to it that would permit it
to make payments pursuant to the New Notes.

In addition, the borrower under the New Proceeds Loan, Drax Corporate Limited, is a holding company
with no independent revenue-generating business, operations or significant assets other than investments in its
subsidiaries. Drax Corporate Limited depends upon the receipt of sufficient funds from its subsidiaries to meet its
obligations, including payments owed under the New Proceeds Loan, the Initial Notes Proceeds Loan and the
2022 Notes Proceeds Loan. If our operating subsidiaries do not distribute cash to Drax Corporate Limited to
make scheduled payments to the Issuer on the New Proceeds Loan, the Initial Notes Proceeds Loan and the 2022
Notes Proceeds Loan, we do not expect Drax Corporate Limited to have any other source of funds that would
allow it to make payments on the New Proceeds Loan, the Initial Notes Proceeds Loan and the 2022 Notes
Proceeds Loan. Various agreements governing our debt may restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to move cash
within the restricted group. Applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to further taxation. Applicable
law may also limit the amounts that some of Drax Corporate Limited’s subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as
dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or even prevent such payments. The inability to transfer cash
among entities within their respective consolidated groups may mean that even though the entities, in aggregate,
may have sufficient resources to meet the obligations under the New Proceeds Loan, the 2022 Notes Proceeds
Loan, the Initial Proceeds Loan, the New Notes, the 2022 Notes and the Initial Notes, they may not be permitted
to make the necessary dividends or distributions from one entity in their restricted group to another entity in their
restricted group in order to make payments to the entity owing the obligations.

In such circumstances, holders of the New Notes would have to rely upon claims for payment under the
Guarantees and on all available security. However, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that following the
occurrence of an acceleration of any of the classes of debt secured by the Collateral and subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement, payments in respect of the New Notes and the Guarantees will be prohibited except
from enforcement proceeds of the Collateral or any pro rata distribution or dividend out of the Issuer’s or a
Guarantor’s unsecured assets. In addition, such payments are subject to the risks and limitations described herein.

**_Each Guarantee and security interest is subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by_**
**_applicable law or subject to certain defences that may limit its validity and enforceability._**

Each Guarantee will provide holders of the New Notes with a direct claim against the relevant Guarantor.
However, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that following the occurrence of an acceleration of any of the
classes of debt secured by the Collateral and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, payments in respect of the
New Notes and the Guarantees will be prohibited except from enforcement proceeds of the Collateral or any pro
_rata distribution or dividend out of the Issuer’s or a Guarantor’s unsecured assets. In addition, the obligations in_
respect of the New Notes and the Note Guarantees will be secured by the Collateral under the relevant Security
Documents. However, each security interest granted under a Security Document will be limited in scope to the
value of the relevant assets expressed to be subject to such Security Document, and the Indenture provides that
each Guarantee and security interest granted by a Guarantor will be limited to the maximum amount that can be
secured by the Issuer and the Guarantors without rendering the relevant Guarantee or security interest voidable or
otherwise ineffective under English, Scots, United States or other applicable law and enforcement of each
Guarantee and security interest against the Issuer and the Guarantors is subject to certain generally available
defences. These laws and defences include those that relate to insolvency, voidable preference, fraudulent

68


-----

conveyance, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, the preservation of share capital, thin
capitalisation and defences affecting the rights of creditors generally. See “Certain Insolvency Considerations
_and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security”._

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other
laws, a court could (i) avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee of the
Notes or any security interests; (ii) direct that the holders of the New Notes return any amounts paid under the
relevant Guarantee or realised from the enforcement of the Collateral to the relevant Guarantor or security
provider or to a fund for the benefit of the relevant Guarantor’s or security provider’s creditors; or (iii) take other
action that is detrimental to holders of the New Notes, typically if the court found that:

   - the relevant Guarantee was incurred or the relevant security interest was granted with actual intent to give
preference to one creditor over another, hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the
Guarantor or security provider or, in certain jurisdictions, when the granting of the Guarantee or security
interest has the effect of giving a creditor a preference or when the recipient was aware that the Guarantor
or security provider was insolvent when it granted the relevant Guarantee or security interest;

   - the Guarantor or security provider did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or
corporate benefit for the relevant Guarantee or security interest and the Guarantor or security provider:
(i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Guarantee or security interest; (ii) was
undercapitalised or became undercapitalised because of the relevant Guarantee or security interest; or
(iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity;

   - the relevant Guarantee or security interest was held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or
security provider or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor or security
provider; or

   - the amounts paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee or the enforcement proceeds under the relevant
Security Document were in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law.

These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee or security interest granted by any of our
subsidiaries pursuant to the Indenture.

There can be no assurance which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor or
security provider was “insolvent” at the relevant time or that, regardless of method of valuation, a court would
not determine that a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not
determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on the date the Guarantee
was issued or the relevant security interest granted, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted preferences,
fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds.

The liability of each Guarantor under its Guarantee of the New Notes and the enforcement proceeds under
each Security Document will be limited to the amount that will result in such Guarantee or security interest not
constituting a preference, fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside.
However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the
maximum liability of each Guarantor or security provider. There is a possibility that the entire Guarantee or
security interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability under the relevant Note Guarantee or Security
Document may be extinguished.

If a court decided that a Guarantee or security interest was a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance
and voided such Guarantee or security interest, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, a holder of the New
Notes may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor or Collateral and would be an unsecured
creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of any other Guarantor under the relevant Guarantee that has not
been declared void. In the event that any Guarantee is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the
extent the agreed limitation of the Guarantee obligations apply, the New Notes would be effectively subordinated
to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, and if a Guarantor cannot satisfy its obligations under the New Notes
or any Guarantee is found to be a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, the
Issuer cannot assure you that it can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the New Notes. In the event
that any security interest is void or unenforceable, claims of holders of the New Notes would be effectively
subordinated to other claims against the relevant security provider that are secured over the relevant Collateral
and up to the value of such Collateral.

69


-----

**_The New Notes and each of the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to present and future liabilities of_**
**_DGHL’s non-Guarantor subsidiaries._**

Some, but not all, of DGHL’s subsidiaries will guarantee the New Notes, which means that the holders of
the New Notes will have no direct claims against the assets or earnings of such non-Guarantor subsidiaries to
satisfy obligations due under the New Notes or the Guarantees. For the year ended 31 December 2018, the
Guarantors (excluding DGEL) generated Adjusted EBITDA of £257.1 million, representing 103 per cent. of the
Group’s Adjusted EBITDA. As of 31 December 2018, the total assets of the Guarantors (including DGEL) were
£4,262.7 million (excluding goodwill), representing 99 per cent. of the Group’s total assets (excluding goodwill).
Any of DGHL’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the New Notes do not have any obligations to pay amounts
due on the New Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. Accordingly, you should only rely on the
Guarantees to provide credit support in respect of payments of principal or interest on the New Notes. Generally,
claims of creditors of a non-Guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors and claims of preference shareholders
(if any) of such subsidiary, will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of such subsidiary over the
claims of creditors of such non-Guarantor’s parent entity, including claims by holders of the New Notes under
the Guarantees. In the event of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, administration,
reorganisation or other insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding of any of DGHL’s non-Guarantor subsidiaries,
holders of their indebtedness and their trade creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from
the assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to the direct or indirect
shareholders of such entity, including DGHL and the Guarantors. As such, the New Notes, each Guarantee and
the New Proceeds Loan will each be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade creditors) and
preference shareholders (if any) of DGHL’s non-Guarantor subsidiaries. The covenants in the New Notes permit
us to incur additional indebtedness at subsidiaries that do not guarantee the New Notes and in the future the
revenues and Adjusted EBITDA of such entities could increase, possibly substantially.

**_The claims of the holders of the New Notes will be effectively subordinated to the rights of our existing and_**
**_future secured creditors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness do not also secure_**
**_the New Notes._**

The claims of any secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also secure the New Notes will
have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the New Notes. As such, the claims of the
holders of the New Notes will be effectively subordinated to the rights of such secured creditors to the extent of
the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.

**_Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition, our ability to operate the business, react to_**
**_changes in the economy or in the industry and pay our debts and could divert our cash flow from operations_**
**_for debt payments._**

We have, and following the issuance of the New Notes will continue to have, a substantial amount of debt
and debt service obligations. We cannot assure you that we will generate enough cash flow from operations to
service our debt obligations. After giving pro forma effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on
31 December 2018, we would have had £1,175.7 million of borrowings outstanding, including £156.9 million
(assuming an issuance at par) under the New Notes (being the pound sterling equivalent of $200 million
converted at a rate of $1.2751 to £1.00, which was the market rate on 31 December 2018, sourced from Reuters,
used for the preparation of its balance sheet contained in the 2018 Drax Group Audited Financial Statements),
£350 million under the 2022 Notes and £235.3 million under the Initial Notes. In addition, as at 31 December
2018, the Senior Facilities, which provide for up to £350 million of senior secured borrowings, had been utilised
in respect of letters of credit with a total value of £31.8 million, and the term loan facility of £35 million was
fully drawn. Our exposure under our hedging obligations (including the obligations under the Secured Trading
Line and other secured hedging) will also fluctuate from time to time and could be substantial. There is no
limitation in the 2022 Indenture or the Indenture, to our incurrence of certain hedging obligations. For further
details, see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements” and “Description of Notes”. We anticipate that our
leverage will continue to be in place for the foreseeable future. Our leverage could have important consequences
for our business and operations, and therefore for holders of the New Notes offered hereby, including:

   - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the New Notes and other
indebtedness and liabilities;

   - restricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or exploiting certain business opportunities;

   - negatively impacting credit terms with our creditors;

70


-----

   - increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and
industry conditions;

   - requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our
indebtedness, thereby limiting cash flow available to fund our working capital, capital expenditures,
acquisitions, joint ventures or other general corporate requirements;

   - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in tax regulations, our business and the
industry;

   - placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared with our competitors, to the extent that they are not as
highly leveraged;

   - compromising our ability to capitalise on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures, as
compared with our competitors due to the maintenance covenants in some of our debt instruments; and

   - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing, or negatively impacting the terms of such financing, to
fund future working capital, capital expenditures, joint ventures, other general corporate requirements and
acquisitions.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our
debt obligations, including the obligations under the New Notes (and the 2022 Notes and the Initial Notes). Our
ability to make payments on and refinance our indebtedness and to fund working capital expenditures and other
expenses will depend on our future operating performance and ability to generate cash from operations. Our ability
to generate cash from operations is subject, in large part, to general economic, competitive, legislative and
regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our control. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow
from operations nor obtain enough capital to service our debt or fund our planned capital expenditures. For a
discussion of our cash flows and liquidity, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources”._

**_You may face interest rate risks by investing in the New Notes, as certain of our borrowings bear interest at_**
**_floating rates that could rise significantly, increasing our interest cost and reducing cash flow._**

We may incur additional indebtedness that bears interest at a floating rate. LIBOR, EURIBOR and/or any other
floating interest rate applicable to such indebtedness could rise significantly in the future. Certain of our current debt
facilities, including the Revolving Facility and the 2018 Bridge Facility, are exposed to interest rate risk.
Fluctuations in LIBOR, EURIBOR and/or any other floating rate interest, or the occurrence of certain events (as
defined in the relevant debt facility) may increase our overall interest burden and may have a material adverse effect
on our ability to service our debt obligations. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior
_Facilities Agreement” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—2018 Bridge Facility Agreement”._

**_Changes or uncertainty in respect of LIBOR may affect our sources of funding_**

Some of our sources of funding are linked to LIBOR. See “—You may face interest rate risks by investing in
_the New Notes, as certain of our borrowings bear interest at floating rates that could rise significantly, increasing_
_our interest cost and reducing cash flow”. Various interest rate benchmarks (including LIBOR) are the subject of_
recent national and international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Some reforms are already effective,
including the EU Benchmark Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/1011) (the “Benchmarks Regulation”), while
others are still to be implemented. In addition, the sustainability of LIBOR has been questioned by the FCA as a
result of the absence of relevant active underlying markets and possible disincentives (including possibly as a result
of regulatory reforms) for market participants to continue contributing to such benchmarks. On 29 November 2017,
the Bank of England and the FCA announced that the market Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free Rates would
have an extended mandate to catalyse a broad transition to the Sterling Over Night Index Average rate (“SONIA”)
across sterling bond, loan and derivatives markets so that SONIA is established as the primary sterling interest rate
benchmark by the end of 2021. The Bank of England and FCA have stated that a key near-term priority for the
Working Group will be to make recommendations relating to the potential development of term SONIA reference
rates. A public consultation took place in 2018 and a summary of responses has been published. These reforms and
other pressures may cause such benchmarks to disappear entirely, to perform differently than in the past (as a result
of a change in methodology or otherwise), create disincentives for market participants to continue to administer or
participate in certain benchmarks or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Based on the foregoing,
investors should in particular be aware that:

   - any of these reforms or pressures described above or any other changes to a relevant interest rate benchmark
(including LIBOR) could affect the level of the published rate, including causing it to be lower and/or more
volatile than it would otherwise be; and

71


-----

   - if LIBOR is discontinued, then the rate of interest applicable to our sources of funding may be determined
for a period by applicable fall-back provisions, although such provisions, often being dependent in part
upon the provision by reference banks of offered quotations for the LIBOR rate, may not operate as
intended (depending on market circumstances and the availability of rates information at the relevant
time) and may in certain circumstances result in the effective application of a fixed rate based on the rate
which applied in the previous period when LIBOR was available.

More generally, any of the above matters or any other significant change to the setting or existence of
LIBOR could affect the ability of amounts available to us to meet our obligations under our sources of funding
and/or could have a material adverse effect on the value or liquidity of, and the amount payable under, our
sources of funding. Changes in the manner of administration of LIBOR could result in adjustment to the
conditions applicable to our sources of funding or other consequences as relevant to our sources of funding
including, without limitation, early redemption, discretionary valuation, delisting or other consequences. No
assurance can be provided that relevant changes will not be made to LIBOR or any other relevant benchmark rate
and/or that such benchmarks will continue to exist.

**_Despite current indebtedness levels, our subsidiaries may incur substantially more debt, which could further_**
**_exacerbate the risks associated with our leverage._**

The terms of the Indenture and the terms of the 2022 Indenture permit us to incur substantial additional
indebtedness in the future, significant amounts of which may be secured and share in the Collateral securing the
New Notes. Certain creditors in respect of our indebtedness, including lenders under the Senior Facilities
Agreement and counterparties under certain hedging obligations (including obligations under the Secured
Trading Line) will receive proceeds from the enforcement of security granted over the Collateral prior to the
holders of the New Notes (and the 2022 Notes and the Initial Notes). In addition, the Indenture and the 2022
Indenture allow our non-Guarantor subsidiaries to incur additional debt that would be structurally senior to the
New Notes (and 2022 Notes and the Initial Notes) and will not prevent us from incurring liabilities that do not
constitute “Indebtedness” as defined thereunder. Although the agreements governing our debt instruments
contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of
qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be
substantial. Our exposure under our hedging obligations (including obligations under the Secured Trading Line
and other secured hedging) will also fluctuate from time to time and could be substantial. There are no
limitations in the Indenture, to our incurrence of certain hedging obligations. If we incur additional debt above
the levels currently in effect, the risks associated with our leverage, including those described above, would
increase. Any future indebtedness that we incur could include covenants that are more restrictive than the Notes,
including limitations on leverage levels and requirements to make amortisation payments and other mandatory
prepayment provisions, which could prevent us from running our business as we see fit, which could have an
adverse effect on our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, including due to factors outside_**
**_our control, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which_**
**_may not be successful._**

We have substantial debt outstanding and debt service obligations. Our ability to make interest or principal
payments on or to refinance our debt obligations, including the Senior Facilities, 2018 Bridge Facility and our
obligations under the New Notes, the Initial Notes and the 2022 Notes, as well as our hedging obligations
(including obligations under the Secured Trading Line), will depend on our future operating performance and
ability to generate sufficient cash. Our ability to generate cash from operations is subject, in part, to general
economic, financial, competitive, market, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.
Our significant leverage may also make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the New
Notes and expose us to interest rate increases to the extent any of our variable rate debt (such as the Revolving
Facility and the 2018 Bridge Facility) is not hedged.

Our business may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations to make payments on our debt
obligations, and additional debt and equity financing may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable
us to pay our debts when due, or to refinance such debts, including the New Notes, the Initial Notes and the 2022
Notes. If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations
as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

   - reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures;

   - sell assets;

72


-----

   - obtain additional debt or equity financing; or

   - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Senior Facilities, the 2018 Bridge
Facility, the 2022 Notes, the Initial Notes and the New Notes, on or before maturity.

We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on
satisfactory terms, if at all.

If any of the above were to occur, the holders of our debt may be able to accelerate our debt and, to the
extent such debt is secured, foreclose on our assets. The type, timing and terms of any future financing,
restructuring, asset sales or other capital raising transactions will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing
conditions in the financial markets. There can be no assurance that we will be able to accomplish any of these
measures in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In particular, our ability to
restructure or refinance our debt will depend in part on our financial condition at such time. See “—Our results
_from operations are dependent on our exposure to UK wholesale electricity prices and the UK economy”. Any_
refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates than our current debt and may require us to comply with
more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business. The terms of existing or future debt
instruments and the Indenture may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives.

In addition, any failure to make payments of interest or principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a
timely basis would likely result in the downgrading of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur
additional indebtedness. In the absence of sufficient resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and
might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. The
terms of our indebtedness, including the 2022 Indenture and the Indenture, restrict our ability to transfer or sell
assets and to use the proceeds from any such disposition. We may not be able to consummate certain dispositions
or obtain the funds that we could have realised from the proceeds of such dispositions, and any proceeds we do
realise from asset dispositions may not be adequate to meet any of our debt service obligations then due. These
alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our debt service obligations.

Furthermore, any downgrading of our credit rating could harm our ability to engage in commodity or other
hedging transactions, which are an important part of our operations, or else require us to post increased amounts
of collateral in support of such transactions. If we were unable to engage in hedging transactions on terms that
were acceptable to us or at all, this would have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, prospects,
financial condition and results of operations.

Restrictive covenants in the Senior Facilities Agreement, the 2018 Bridge Facility Agreement, the 2022
Indenture and the Indenture may restrict our ability to operate our business.

The 2022 Indenture, the Indenture, the 2018 Bridge Facility Agreement and the Senior Facilities Agreement
restrict, among other things, our ability to:

   - incur or guarantee additional debt or issue preferred stock;

   - make certain payments, including dividends and other restricted payments;

   - create, permit to exist or incur liens;

   - make certain investments or acquisitions, including participation in joint ventures;

   - agree to limitations on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions;

   - engage in sales, leases or transfers of certain assets and subsidiary stock;

   - enter into certain transactions with affiliates;

   - transfer all or substantially all of our assets or enter into merger or consolidation transactions;

   - engage in certain activities (with respect to the Issuer);

   - impair the security interests; and

   - create Unrestricted Subsidiaries.

All of these limitations are subject to certain exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of Notes—
_Certain Covenants”, “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—2022 Notes—Covenants and events of_
_default”, “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Facilities Agreement” and “Description of_

73


-----

_Certain Financing Arrangements—2018 Bridge Facility Agreement”. Our compliance with these covenants_
could reduce our flexibility in conducting our operations, particularly by:

   - affecting our ability to react to changes in market conditions, whether by increasing our vulnerability in
relation to unfavourable economic conditions or by preventing us from profiting from an improvement in
those conditions;

   - affecting our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest;

   - limiting our ability to obtain certain additional financing in order to meet our working capital
requirements, make investments or acquisitions and carry out refinancings; and

   - forcing us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flows to payment of the sums due on our
indebtedness, thus reducing our ability to utilise our cash flow for other purposes.

In addition, certain of our financing arrangements, including the Senior Facilities Agreement, require us or
certain of our subsidiaries to comply with certain additional negative covenants. The Senior Facilities Agreement
requires us to comply with customary negative covenants, subject to certain agreed exceptions, including, but not
limited to, (i) restrictions on change of business, (ii) restrictions on change of centre of main interests,
(ii) restrictions on change of share capital, (iv) restrictions on the purchase or redemption of the 2022 Notes,
(v) restrictions on the activities of DGHL, (vi) restrictions on the incurrence of certain indebtedness by nonobligor subsidiaries, (vii) restrictions on certain disposals of assets to non-obligor subsidiaries, (viii) restrictions
on change to Drax Group plc’s or DGHL’s year end, and (ix) restrictions on the parameters of the Secured Trade
Line.

The Senior Facilities Agreement also requires us to observe certain affirmative undertakings and a financial
covenant. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Facilities Agreement—Undertakings
_and covenants”._

**_If we fail to meet our obligations under our financing agreements, our creditors could declare all amounts_**
**_owed to them due and payable, which could lead to liquidity constraints._**

Our ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions in our debt instruments may be affected by events
beyond our control. These include general economic, financial and industry-related factors and conditions. If we
breach any of the aforementioned covenants or restrictions, we could be in default under the New Notes, the
2022 Notes, the Initial Notes, the Senior Facilities Agreement, the 2018 Bridge Facility Agreement and other
relevant financing agreements.

In the event of a default under the New Notes, the 2022 Notes, the Initial Notes, the Senior Facilities
Agreement, the 2018 Bridge Facility Agreement or any other debt facility agreement, the lenders or creditors
under the respective facilities or financing instruments could take certain actions, including terminating their
commitments, if any, and declaring all amounts that we have borrowed under our credit facilities and other
indebtedness to be due and payable, together with any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, borrowings under
other debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross- default provisions, including the New Notes, the
2022 Notes, the Initial Notes, the Senior Facilities Agreement and the 2018 Bridge Facility Agreement, may as a
result also be accelerated and become due and payable.

If the debt under the 2018 Bridge Facility Agreement, the Senior Facilities Agreement, the 2022 Notes, the
Initial Notes, the New Notes or any other material financing arrangement that we have entered into or will
subsequently enter into were to be accelerated, our assets may be insufficient to repay the Notes in full. Any such
actions could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation, and we might not be able to repay our obligations under the
Notes in such an event.

**_The Issuer may not be able to finance a change of control offer._**

The Indenture requires the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes at 101 per cent. of their principal
amount, if DGHL experiences certain change of control events. The Issuer’s failure to effect a change of control
offer when required would constitute an event of default under the Indenture. The Issuer’s ability to repurchase
any Notes as may be required by the Indenture will depend on our access to funds at such time, and we may not
be able to secure access to enough cash to finance the repurchase. In addition, the Senior Facilities Agreement,
the 2018 Bridge Facility Agreement, other indebtedness of the Group, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement may restrict our ability to make an offer to repurchase the Notes following
the occurrence of such a change of control event. A change of control event may result in an event of default

74


-----

under, acceleration of, or obligation to mandatorily prepay, the Senior Facilities Agreement, the 2018 Bridge
Facility Agreement and other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to a change of control offer
could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the change of control event itself does not.

**_In certain circumstances, a change of control offer is not required to be made._**

The change of control provisions contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford holders of the New
Notes protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganisation, restructuring,
merger or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect holders of the New Notes, because
such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may
not constitute a “Change of Control” as defined in the Indenture. Except as described under “Description of
_Notes—Change of Control”, the Indenture does not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to_
purchase or redeem the relevant Notes in the event of a reorganisation, restructuring, merger, recapitalisation or
similar transaction.

The definition of “Change of Control” in the Indenture includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the
properties or assets of DGHL and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person, other than a
subsidiary of Drax Group plc, Drax Group plc or a parent entity. Although there is a limited body of case law
interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all”, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under
applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a
particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of DGHL’s and its Restricted
Subsidiaries’ assets and therefore it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether
the Issuer is required to make a Change of Control offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_Under certain circumstances, following a tender offer or offer to purchase the Notes, the Issuer may, at its_**
**_option, redeem all of the remaining Notes of non-tendering holders._**

If, pursuant to any tender offer or other offer to purchase all of the Notes, holders of not less than 90 per
cent. of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such
Notes, the Indenture permits the Issuer, or any third party on behalf of the Issuer, at its option, to redeem the
remaining outstanding Notes at a price equivalent to the highest price paid pursuant to such tender offer or offer
to purchase (excluding any early tender premium). As a consequence, holders of the Notes may be required to
surrender the Notes against their will at a price equivalent to the highest price paid to tendering holders,
including if such price is below par, and may not receive the return holders of the Notes expect to receive on the
Notes. See “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption upon Certain Tender Offers”.

**_Holders of the New Notes may not be able to resell the New Notes easily, an active liquid trading market for_**
**_the New Notes may not develop or may be volatile and no assurance can be made regarding the prices at_**
**_which holders of the New Notes might be able to resell the New Notes._**

Although we will apply to list the New Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to
have them admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, we cannot assure
you that the New Notes will become or will remain listed or make any assurance regarding the prices at which
holders of the New Notes would be able to sell New Notes. Furthermore, liquidity will depend on, among other
things, the number of holders of the New Notes, our financial performance, prevailing interest rates, the market
for similar securities and the interest of securities dealers in making a market in the New Notes. In addition,
changes in the overall market for high yield securities and changes in our financial performance or in the markets
where we operate may adversely affect the liquidity of the trading market in the New Notes and the market price
quoted for the New Notes. As a result, we cannot assure you that an active trading market will actually develop
for the New Notes or, if one does develop, that it will be maintained.

Moreover, the price and trading volume of the New Notes may be highly volatile. Factors such as variations
in our revenue, earnings and cash flows and proposals for new investments, strategic alliances and/or
acquisitions, interest rates, fluctuations in prices for securities of comparable companies and Government
regulations and changes thereof applicable to the industry and general economic conditions nationally or
internationally could cause the price of the New Notes to change. Any such developments may result in large and
sudden changes in the trading volume and price of the New Notes. There can be no assurance that these
developments will not occur in the future.

If the New Notes are not listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to
trading on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or on another “recognised stock exchange”

75


-----

within the meaning of section 1005 of the UK Income Tax Act 2007, or cease to be so listed and admitted to
trading, interest payments will generally be paid by the Issuer under deduction of UK income tax at the basic rate
(currently 20 per cent.) and may result in a requirement for the Issuer or a Guarantor to pay Additional Amounts
(as defined under “Description of Notes—Withholding Taxes”) unless relief is available following a direction
from HMRC pursuant to the provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty or any other UK domestic
exemption is available. (See “Tax Considerations—Certain United Kingdom Tax Considerations” and
“Description of Notes—Withholding Taxes”).

**_The Regulation S New Notes will be initially issued with a temporary ISIN and CUSIP. In the event that we_**
**_are unable to transfer the Regulation S New Notes to the permanent ISIN and CUSIP, the Regulation S New_**
**_Notes will continue to trade under a separate ISIN and CUSIP to the Regulation S Initial Notes, which may_**
**_adversely affect the liquidity of the Regulation S New Notes and cause the Regulation S New Notes to trade at_**
**_different prices than the Initial Notes._**

The consolidation date for the Regulation S New Notes will be 40 days after the later of (i) the date of the
original issuance of the New Notes offered hereby and (ii) the date on which the New Notes were first offered to
persons other than distributors as defined in Regulation S under the US Securities Act. Upon the expiration of the
restricted period, we expect that the Regulation S New Notes will have the same ISIN and CUSIP as the
Regulation S Initial Notes, and that the Regulation S New Notes and the Regulation S Initial Notes will thereafter
be fungible. However, in the event that we are unable to transfer the Regulation S New Notes to the permanent
ISIN and CUSIP, the Regulation S New Notes will continue to trade under a separate ISIN and CUSIP to the
Regulation S Initial Notes, which may adversely affect the liquidity of the Regulation S New Notes and cause the
Regulation S New Notes to trade at different prices than the Regulation S Initial Notes.

**_Lenders and holders of our debt may allege in the future that we are not operating in compliance with_**
**_covenants in our debt instruments, which, even if the claims have no merit, could cause the trading price of_**
**_the Notes to decline._**

Lenders or holders of our debt may assert that we are not operating in compliance with covenants in our
debt instruments or make other related allegations, including for the purpose of accelerating the maturity of such
debt and/or attempting to obtain economic benefits from us. Even if any claim by lenders or holders of our debt
alleging non-compliance or an event of default under our debt instruments is without merit, such a claim could
nevertheless cause the trading price of the Notes to decline.

**_Transfer of the New Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the liquidity and the value of the New_**
**_Notes._**

Because the New Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and are not required to be, registered under the
US Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, they may not be offered or sold except to QIBs
in accordance with Rule 144A or in offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S. These restrictions
may limit the ability of holders of the New Notes to resell the New Notes. It is the obligation of each holder of
the New Notes to ensure that its offers and sales of the New Notes within the US and other countries comply with
applicable securities laws. See “Notice to Investors”, “Important Information—Notice to Investors in the United
_States”, “Important Information—Notice to Investors in the United Kingdom”, “Important Information—Notice_
_to Investors in the European Economic Area”, “Important Information—Notice to French Investors”, “Important_
_Information—Notice to German Investors”, “Important Information—Notice to Dutch Investors”, “Important_
_Information—Notice to Swiss Investors”, “Important Information—Notice to Investors in Luxembourg”, and_
“Plan of Distribution” for further information on these restrictions. We have not agreed to or otherwise
undertaken to register any of the Notes or the Guarantees, and do not have any intention to do so.

**_The market value of the New Notes could decrease if the Issuer’s or our creditworthiness worsens._**

In the event any of the risks regarding our business materialises, the likelihood that the Issuer will be in a
position to fully perform all obligations under the New Notes when they fall due will decrease and the market
value of the New Notes is likely to suffer. In addition, even if the likelihood that the Issuer will be in a position to
fully perform all obligations under the New Notes when they fall due has not actually decreased, market
participants could nevertheless have a different perception. Furthermore, the market participants’ estimation of
the creditworthiness of corporate debtors in general or debtors operating in the same business as us could

76


-----

adversely change. If any of these risks occurred, third parties would likely only be willing to purchase New Notes
at a lower price than before any such risk materialised. Under these circumstances, the market value of the New
Notes is likely to decrease.

**_Credit ratings assigned to the Notes may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold_**
**_securities and may be subject to revision, suspension, withdrawal and may be lowered at any time._**

Credit ratings address the Issuer’s ability to perform its obligations under the terms of the New Notes and
credit risks in determining the likelihood that payments will be made when due under the New Notes. The ratings
may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed
above and other factors that may affect the value of the New Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to
buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any
time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will be confirmed, remain constant for any given period of
time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its
judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. The Issuer has no obligation to inform holders of the New
Notes of any such revision, downgrade or withdrawal. Other credit ratings agencies that do not publish ratings
with respect to the New Notes may assign a lower rating than any published rating of the New Notes. A
suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the New Notes by one or more of
the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could
adversely affect the value, market price and trading of the New Notes.

**_Holders of the New Notes may be unable to recover in civil proceedings for US securities laws violations._**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors, are incorporated under the laws of England and Wales and
Scotland and do not have any assets in the US. It is anticipated that a majority of the directors and executive
officers of the Issuer and DGHL will be non-residents of the US and that a majority of their assets will be located
outside the US. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the US upon
the Issuer and the majority of the Guarantors, or their respective directors and executive officers, or to enforce
any judgments obtained in US courts predicated upon civil liability provisions of the US securities laws. In
addition, the Issuer cannot assure you that civil liabilities predicated upon the federal securities laws of the US
will be enforceable in England and Wales or Scotland. See “Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil
_Liabilities”._

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the New Notes._**

The New Notes will be denominated and payable in US dollars. If investors measure their investment
returns by reference to a currency other than US dollars or pounds sterling, as applicable, an investment in the
New Notes will entail foreign exchange-related risk due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in
the value of the US dollar or pound sterling relative to the currency by reference to which the investor measures
the return on its investments because of economic, political and other factors over which the Issuer has no
control. Depreciation of the US dollar or pound sterling, as applicable, against the currency by reference to which
an investor measures the return on its investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the New Notes
below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on the New Notes is
translated into the currency by reference to which the investor measures the return on its investments.

**_The New Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the_**
**_relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The New Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through DTC or its
nominee. Interests in the Global Notes will trade in book-entry form only, and the Notes in definitive registered
form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”) will be issued in exchange for book-entry interests only in very limited
circumstances. Unless and until Definitive Registered Notes are issued in exchange for book-entry interests,
owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of the New Notes. DTC, or its nominee,
will be the registered holder of the Global Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or
in respect of the Global Notes will be made to The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch, as paying agent,
which will make payments to DTC. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to DTC participants’ accounts
(including Euroclear and Clearstream) that hold book-entry interests in the Global Notes representing the New
Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to DTC, the Issuer, Trustee,
Paying Agent, Transfer Agent and Registrar will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest,
principal or other amounts to to DTC, or owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry

77


-----

interest, you must rely on the procedures of DTC, and if you are not a participant in DTC, on the procedures of
the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the New
Notes under the Indenture.

Unlike the holders of the New Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct
right to act upon the Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the
New Notes. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have
received appropriate proxies to do so from DTC or, if applicable, from a participant (including Euroclear and
Clearstream). The procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable you
to vote on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until the relevant
Definitive Registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry interest, you
will be restricted to acting through DTC or, if applicable, a participant (including Euroclear and Clearstream).
The procedures to be implemented through DTC may not be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights
under the New Notes. See “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form”.

**_Investors in and purchasers of the New Notes may have limited or no recourse against our independent_**
**_auditors in respect of the Drax Group Audited Financial Statements._**

See “Independent Auditors” for a description of the independent auditors’ reports of Deloitte LLP of the
Group.

Investors in and purchasers of the Notes should understand that consistent with guidance issued by the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (the “ICAEW”), each of the independent auditors’
reports of Deloitte LLP included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum states that the report has been prepared
for Drax Group plc’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act.
Deloitte LLP’s audit work has been undertaken so that Deloitte LLP might state to Drax Group plc’s members
those matters Deloitte LLP is required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the
fullest extent permitted by law, Deloitte LLP does not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than Drax
Group plc and Drax Group plc’s members, as a body, for its audit work, for its report, or for the opinions it has
formed.

The SEC would not permit such limiting language to be included in a registration statement or a prospectus
used in connection with an offering of securities registered under the US Securities Act, or in a report filed under
the US Exchange Act. If a US court (or any other court) were to give effect to the language set out above, the
recourse that investors in and purchasers of the Notes may have against the independent auditors based on their
reports or the financial statements or non-statutory financial statements to which they relate could be limited. The
extent to which independent auditors may have responsibility or liability to third parties can be unclear under the
laws of many jurisdictions, including the UK. The inclusion of the language referred to above, however, may
limit the ability of holders of the New Notes to bring any action against the independent auditors for damages
arising out of an investment in or purchase of the New Notes.

In the context of the Offering, the independent auditors have reconfirmed to us that they do not intend their
duty of care in respect of their audits to extend to any party, such as investors in and purchasers of the New
Notes, other than the respective addressees of their reports. See “Independent Auditors”.

**_Certain covenants may fall away upon the occurrence of a change in our ratings._**

The Indenture provides that, if at any time following the date of the Indenture, the Notes receive two of the
following three ratings, BBB- or better by S&P, Baa3 or better by Moody’s and BBB- or better by Fitch and no
default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day and continuing until such time,
if any, at which such Notes cease to have such ratings, certain covenants will cease to be applicable to such
Notes. See “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment
_Grade Status”._

If these covenants were to cease to be applicable, we would be able to incur additional indebtedness or make
payments, including dividends or investments, which may conflict with the interests of holders of the New Notes.
There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve an investment grade rating or that any such rating will
be maintained.

**_The insolvency laws of England and Wales and Scotland and other jurisdictions may not be as favourable as_**
**_US or other insolvency laws._**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of England and Wales and certain of the Guarantors are
incorporated under the laws of England and Wales and Scotland. In addition, the Collateral will include a pledge
over the shares in DGHL and certain of DGHL’s subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of England and Wales
and Scotland and pledges of certain present and future intercompany receivables held by Drax Group plc, DGHL,
the Issuer and certain of DGHL’s other subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of England and Wales and
Scotland.

In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in England and
Wales or Scotland or another relevant jurisdiction. Such multi-jurisdictional proceedings may be complex and
more costly for creditors and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of
your rights. The rights of a holder of the New Notes under the New Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the
Collateral will be subject to the insolvency and administrative laws of several jurisdictions and there can be no
assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce these rights in such complex, multiple bankruptcy,
insolvency or similar proceedings.

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of Drax Group plc’s, the Issuer’s and
the non-US Guarantors’ jurisdictions of organisation or incorporation may be materially different from, or in
conflict with, each other and those of the US, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of
governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceeding. The
application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular
jurisdiction’s law should apply, adversely affect the ability of holders of the New Notes to enforce their rights
under the New Notes and the Guarantees in those jurisdictions or limit any amounts that they may receive. See
“Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and
_Security” with respect to certain of the jurisdictions mentioned above._

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The gross proceeds from the Offering are expected to be £156.9 million (assuming an issuance at par)
(representing the pound sterling equivalent of the $200 million converted at a rate of $1.2751 to £1.00, which
was the market rate on 31 December 2018, sourced from Reuters, used for the preparation of its balance sheet
contained in the 2018 Drax Group Audited Financial Statements. We intend to use the gross proceeds of the
Offering to (i) to partially repay indebtedness outstanding under the 2018 Bridge Facility Agreement and (ii) to
pay estimated fees and expenses of the Offering and the partial repayment of the 2018 Bridge Facility, including
underwriting fees and commissions, professional fees and other associated transaction costs as well as applicable
prepayment fees and accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repayment.

The following table sets out the expected sources and uses of funds from the Offering. Actual amounts are
subject to adjustments and may vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including, but not
limited to, differences in the outstanding balances and accrued but unpaid interest of the Bridge Facility on the
Issue Date, fluctuations in the exchange rate and differences between the fees and expenses expected and the fees
and expenses incurred in connection with the Offering and the partial repayment of the 2018 Bridge Facility. For
a description of our anticipated indebtedness following the Transactions, see “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements” and “Capitalisation”._

Reuters, used for the preparation of its balance sheet contained in the 2018 Drax Group Audited Financial Statements (other than the
amount of accrued interest from 1 May 2019 to the issue date).

(2) Represents the partial repayment of the principal amount outstanding under the 2018 Bridge Facility.

**CAPITALISATION**

The following table sets forth, in each case, our cash and cash equivalents and consolidated capitalisation as
of 31 December 2018 on (i) an actual basis and (ii) an as adjusted basis to give effect to the Transactions as if
they had occurred on 31 December 2018. All the borrowings shown in the table below are before deferred
finance costs. The as adjusted financial information below is illustrative only and does not purport to be
indicative of our capitalisation following completion of the Transactions.

The historical information has been derived from our financial statements as of and for the year ended
31 December 2018. You should read this table together with “Use of Proceeds”, “Selected Financial
_Information”, “Summary—The Financing”, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and_
_Results of Operations” and the Group’s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included_
elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

(1) Represents the payment of the initial consideration due to the vendor on 2 January 2019 in connection with the DGEL Acquisition using
a combination of £550.0 million drawn under the 2018 Bridge Facility and £136.9 million of cash reserves.

(2) Adjustments to cash and cash equivalents represent £136.9 million of cash paid to the vendor on 2 January 2019 in respect of the DGEL
Acquisition.

(3) The Senior Facilities provide for up to £350 million of senior secured borrowings, comprised of a £315 million committed
multicurrency revolving credit facility and a £35 million term loan facility. The carrying value of the term loan at 31 December 2018 is
£37.1 million which includes £2.1 million indexation.

(4) Represents the £550 million drawn under the 2018 Bridge Facility, which was utilised to partially finance the DGEL Acquisition on
2 January 2019. The proceeds of the Offering will be used to repay £154.1 million of the principal amount outstanding under the 2018
Bridge Facility. See “Use of Proceeds”. Following the Offering, £395.9 million of the principal amount of indebtedness under the 2018
Bridge Facility Agreement will remain outstanding. Following the Offering, we expect to refinance the portion of indebtedness under
the 2018 Bridge Facility Agreement that will remain outstanding in 2019.

(5) Represents the £350 million aggregate amount of 4 [1]⁄4% Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes due 2022. The 2022 Notes have a total
carrying value of £342.4 million, which is net of unamortised finance costs of £7.6 million.

(6) Represents the pound sterling equivalent of the $300 million aggregate amount of 6 [5]⁄8% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 calculated
using a currency exchange rate of $1.2751 to £1.00, which was the market rate on 31 December 2018, sourced from Reuters, used for
the preparation of its balance sheet contained in the 2018 Drax Group Audited Financial Statements. The Initial Notes have a total
carrying value of £231.9 million, which is net of unamortised finance costs of £3.4 million. During 2018, the Group entered into a
cross-currency interest rate swap, fixing the sterling value of the principal repayments in respect of the Initial Notes. If US dollar
balances relating to the Initial Notes are translated at the hedged rate, rather than the rate prevailing at 31 December 2018, our net debt
would have been reduced by £22.0 million.

(7) Reflects the carrying value.

(8) Represents the pound sterling equivalent of the $200 million principal amount of the New Notes offered hereby calculated using a
currency exchange rate of $1.2751 to £1.00, which was the market rate on 31 December 2018, sourced from Reuters, used for the
preparation of its balance sheet contained in the 2018 Drax Group Audited Financial Statements. No adjustment has been made for the
costs expected in connection with the Offering that will be offset against the proceeds therefrom in determining the initial carrying
value of the New Notes.

(9) Market capitalisation as at 25 April 2019.

**SELECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

The following tables present selected historical consolidated financial data for Drax Group plc as at and for
the years ended 31 December 2016, 2017 and 2018. Unless specified otherwise, the selected historical
consolidated financial data of Drax Group plc as of and for the years ended 31 December 2016, 2017 and 2018
has been derived from the Drax Group Audited Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum. The financial information of the Group as of and for the year ended 31 December 2018
(i) includes the assets and liabilities of the DGEL Group acquired in connection with the DGEL Acquisition in
the Drax Group’s balance sheet as of 31 December 2018 and (ii) does not include income, expenditure or cash
flows of the DGEL Group. The Drax Group Audited Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with
IFRS.

As discussed in Note 8.3 to the 2018 Drax Group Audited Financial Statements, the Group’s audited
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended 31 December 2018 are not directly comparable
with the Group’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended 31 December 2016 and
2017, due to (i) the adoption of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which took effect as of 1 January 2018, and (ii) the
change in presentation of the Group’s consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 December 2018 to
include unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts in the line item to which they relate (revenue or cost
of sales, as applicable), instead of in a separate line item below gross profit. The unaudited comparative
information as of and for the year ended 31 December 2017 included in the Group’s audited consolidated
financial statements as of and for the year ended 31 December 2018 has been restated in order to give effect to
the adoption of IFRS 9 as if it had occurred on 1 January 2017 and has been re-presented to reflect the change in
presentation of unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts. Financial information derived from such
unaudited comparative information as of and for the year ended 31 December 2017 is presented as “restated” in
the below tables and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. In this Offering Memorandum, we present
financial information for the year ended 31 December 2017 on a restated and non-restated basis. Additionally,
comparative financial information for the year ended 31 December 2016 has not been restated or re-presented in
accordance with the aforementioned changes in accounting policy and income statement presentation,
respectively, which may affect the comparability of results on a year-to-year basis for the historical results of
operations included in this Offering Memorandum and future periods with historical results of operations.

The financial information below includes certain Non-IFRS Measures used to evaluate the Group’s
economic and financial performance. These measures are not identified as accounting measures under IFRS and
therefore should not be considered as an alternative measure to evaluate the Group’s performance. See
“Presentation of Financial Information and Other Information—Non-IFRS Financial Measures”. The financial
information below is not necessarily indicative of future results of operations. Prospective investors should read
the selected data presented below in conjunction with “Use of Proceeds”, “Capitalisation”, “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Drax Group Audited_
Financial Statements for 2016, 2017 and 2018 and the related notes thereto, which are included elsewhere in this
Offering Memorandum.

(1) For the years ended 31 December 2017 (restated) and 2018, our revenue and cost of sales includes certain remeasurements on
derivative contracts which cannot be designated as hedging instruments under IFRS which comprise gains or losses on derivative
contracts to the extent that those contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, or hedge accounting is not effective, and those gains or
losses are either (i) unrealised and relate to the delivery of commodity contracts in future periods, or (ii) are realised in relation to the
delivery of commodity contracts in the current period. The effect of excluding certain remeasurements from results of operations is to
reflect commodity sales and purchases at contracted prices—i.e. at the all-in-hedged amount paid or received in respect of the delivery
of the commodity in question. For the year ended 31 December 2016, unrealised gains/(losses) on derivative contracts are included in a
single line item below gross profit instead of in the line item to which they relate (revenue or cost of sales, as applicable).

(2) We define Adjusted EBITDA as profit/loss for the year before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and certain material items that do
not reflect the underlying trading performance of the business. Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended 31 December 2017 (both as
restated and prior to restatement) and 2018 does not exclude the receipt of £8.0 million and £16.9 million of insurance proceeds
primarily recognised within cost of sales, respectively, in respect of insurance claims, including claims for loss of generation from our
biomass units from 2016 through 2018. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation
or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported under IFRS. See “Presentation of Financial Information and Other
_Information—Non-IFRS Financial Measures” for more information. A reconciliation from profit/loss for the year to Adjusted EBITDA_
is presented below:

Audited Financial Statements.

(b) Represents asset obsolescence charges relating to coal-specific assets written-off following the conversion of the fourth unit at
Drax Power Station to run on biomass.

(c) Represents the loss realised on the disposal of multiple immaterial assets compared to the book value of the respective assets. For

(£21.0 million), closure of our Atlanta, Georgia office to relocate the US head office to Monroe, Louisiana (£3.7 million) and
certain restructuring costs in our B2B business (£3.0 million). For the year ended 31 December 2017, represents the costs
associated with the acquisition and integration of Opus into the Group. In the years 2016 and 2017, this line item was previously
defined as “Acquisition-related costs”.

(e) For the year ended 31 December 2018, represents a credit relating to contingent consideration in connection with our OCGT
projects. For the year ended 31 December 2017, represents unrealised losses on the equity investment in Aggregated Micro
Power Holdings Plc (£0.2 million) as well as a charge relating to contingent consideration payable in connection with our OCGT

(f) For an explanation of certain remeasurements, please see footnote (1) above under the caption “—Selected Historical Financial
_and Other Information”._

(3) Beginning in 2018, we include the cost of debt restructure, which comprises costs associated with the refinancing of our debt, within
interest payable and other similar charges. The years ended 31 December 2016 and 2017 have been re-presented to conform to this
presentation. Cost of debt restructure was £nil, £24.2 million and £7.2 million in the years ended 31 December 2016, 2017 and 2018,
respectively.

Beginning in 2017, we separated foreign exchange gains and losses from interest payable and similar charges. The year ended

**Overview**

We are an innovative electricity generation and supply business with operations in the UK and the US
working to enable a zero-carbon, lower-cost energy future. Our business comprises three segments with an
integrated strategy where we source and produce fuel in the form of sustainable wood pellets, generate
electricity, and supply electricity, gas and services to end customers.

86


-----

We are a power generator with generation sites across the UK with a total generation capacity of
approximately 6.5GW. Our generation portfolio consists of Drax Power Station and the generation assets of
DGEL, which we acquired through the DGEL Acquisition in December 2018. Drax Power Station is our single
largest generation asset and is comprised of our four biomass and two coal generation units and our remaining
generation assets comprise a diversified portfolio of pumped storage, hydro and gas generation assets. Our
generation assets are located in England and Scotland, and we have options to develop a further 6.6GW of
generation capacity in the UK.

We own and operate Drax Power Station which is the largest power plant in the UK by generation capacity
with an installed capacity of approximately 4.0GW. Drax Power Station is a critical part of the UK’s energy
infrastructure, generating approximately 5 per cent. of the UK’s total electricity, and approximately 12 per cent.
of the UK’s renewable electricity for the twelve months ended 31 December 2018. Based on the 2017-2018
compliance period, Drax Power Station is also the UK’s largest single-site generator of renewable energy. Drax
Power Station provides flexible and reliable generation and produced 18.3 TWh of electricity in 2018, of which
75 per cent. was generated from sustainable biomass, making us a core part of the UK’s decarbonisation strategy.
In August 2018, we completed the conversion of a fourth coal-fired generation unit at Drax Power Station to
biomass-fired generation at a cost of approximately £30 million (which was lower than the cost of converting
each of the previous three biomass-fired generation units). Our four biomass-fired generation units receive
regulatory support, leading to enhanced earnings streams with a significant component of stable and predictable
revenue extending to 2027. Our biomass-fired generation assets are served by an efficient and reliable biomass
supply chain comprising dedicated port handling infrastructure and rail paths, thereby enhancing security of
supply of fuel for our electricity generation activities. Currently, our two coal-fired generation units provide
important support services to the UK’s electricity system, including greater reliability and flexibility at times of
low De-rated Reserve Margins and system stress.

On 31 December 2018, we acquired ScottishPower’s multi-site, multi-technology 2.6GW portfolio of
pumped storage, hydro and gas-fired generation assets for £687 million (based on total consideration of
£702 million, less customary net debt and working capital adjustments), which we renamed Drax Generation
Enterprise Limited (“DGEL”). DGEL owns and operates the Cruachan pumped storage power plant, hydro
power plants at Galloway and Lanark and four CCGT power stations in Southern and Northern England. This
portfolio of generation assets significantly diversifies our generation capacity, expands our flexible, low-carbon
and renewable generation business model and increases our ability to provide system support services to the UK
energy system. Our acquisition of DGEL accelerates our development from a single-site generation business into
a multi-site, multi-technology national power generator.

We are further responding to the growth in intermittent renewable capacity on the electricity grid by
developing a pipeline of flexible power options, including options to develop up to four 299MW rapid-response
standalone OCGT projects and options to repower one or both of our remaining coal-fired generation units at
Drax Power Station to gas-fired generation with supporting battery storage technology. In addition, our newly
acquired Damhead Creek site benefits from an option for the development of a further CCGT asset, Damhead
Creek II, which would provide us with an additional 1.8GW of gas generation capacity. Each of these projects
has the potential to provide flexible and reliable electricity to the UK electricity system and further diversify our
future energy generation capability. However, each project is subject to a positive investment decision and would
require appropriate support through the Capacity Market. In November 2018, payments under the Capacity
Market were suspended following a ruling by the General Court of the European Union. We expect that this issue
will be resolved and that the Capacity Market will be re-established on the same or similar terms during 2019,
consistent with the position expressed by the Government. For further information on the Capacity Market, see
“Industry Overview—Overview of Electricity Market Reform—Capacity Market” and “Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to Our Business and Industry—The Capacity Market in the UK is currently suspended and its future is_
_uncertain”._

Our B2B Energy Supply segment, comprising Haven Power and Opus, is the fifth largest supplier of
electricity to businesses in the UK by volume supplied as of 31 October 2018 and the largest provider of
renewable energy to businesses. As of 31 December 2018, we supplied over 396,000 electricity and gas meters
and, in 2018, we supplied 20.9 TWh of electricity and gas. Our B2B Energy Supply segment had an 11 per cent.
share of the B2B electricity market as at 31 October 2018 and provides us with a direct route to market for much
of the electricity we generate. We believe that B2B counterparties place fewer credit restrictions on us than
wholesale market counterparties and selling to this market provides us with a more diversified counterparty base
with less concentrated counterparty credit risk.

We produce compressed wood pellets from sustainable sources in three plants in the southern US and use
those pellets as fuel for our biomass-fired generation, which provided 18.0 per cent. of our biomass need in the
year ended 31 December 2018. Following the successful commissioning in 2018 of our third wood pellet
manufacturing facility, our LaSalle facility located in Urania, Louisiana, all three of our wood pellet
manufacturing facilities have the capability to manufacture wood pellets at their nameplate capacity. We
produced 1.35 million tonnes of wood pellets in 2018 representing a 64 per cent. increase on production in 2017
and are increasing capacity at our LaSalle and Morehouse facilities by 175,000 tonnes in aggregate by 2021
(which would represent a 13 per cent. increase on our current production capacity when the incremental capacity,
is fully commissioned), which we anticipate will incur a small fraction of the equivalent cost of building a new
pellet production plant. In addition to self-supply from our manufacturing facilities, we have a network of third
party suppliers of wood pellets and to this end we have entered into long-term contracts with other wood pellet
suppliers in North America and Europe to support a long-term, stable supply of biomass.

Drax Group plc is listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange under stock ticker “DRX”, and
is part of the FTSE 250 Index. Drax Group plc’s market capitalisation as at 25 April 2019 was approximately
£1,366.7 million. As at 31 December 2018, our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA was £249.6 million at market
close and our consolidated net debt as at 31 December 2018 was £319.1 million (noting that if our US dollar
balances relating to the Initial Notes are translated at the hedged rate, rather than the rate prevailing at
31 December 2018, our net debt would have been reduced by £22.0 million). We acquired DGEL on
31 December 2018 and paid the initial consideration due to the vendor on 2 January 2019 using a combination of
£550 million drawn under the 2018 Bridge Facility and £137 million of cash reserves. Accordingly, no profit or
loss has been recognised in respect of DGEL in 2018, and neither the drawing under the 2018 Bridge Facility nor
the reduction in cash in respect of the consideration paid are reflected in our consolidated net debt as at
31 December 2018. Pro forma for the Transactions, our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended
31 December 2018 was £326.8 million and our consolidated net debt as at 31 December 2018 was £1,023.6
million. See “Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data” and “Presentation of Financial
_Information and Other Information”._

The three segments of our business are:

   - Power Generation: Through our Power Generation segment, we play a significant role in providing
reliable, renewable baseload electricity generation capacity as well as important system support services,
enhancing the security of the UK’s electricity supply and supporting the UK’s transition to a low-carbon
future. Following the DGEL Acquisition, Drax is the third largest generator in the UK when taking
account of anticipated output (as published by the System Operator):

In 2018, Drax Power Station generated approximately 5 per cent. of the UK’s electricity needs and its
four sustainable biomass-fired generation units generated approximately 12 per cent. of the UK’s
renewable electricity. In 2017 and 2018, approximately 65 per cent. and 75 per cent., respectively, of
electricity generated by Drax Power Station was from sustainable biomass rather than coal. In 2018, less
than 6 per cent. of our revenue was attributable to sales of electricity generated by our coal-fired
generation units at Drax Power Station. All six generation units at Drax Power Station are the largest in
their class in the UK. Each generation unit can be operated flexibility and independently.

Drax Power Station benefits from regulatory support via the index-linked CfD and RO regimes which
provide Drax Power Station with financial support to facilitate the production of electricity. Following the
conversion of our fourth coal-fired generation unit at Drax Power Station to biomass-fired generation in
August 2018, we are able to optimise our generation in a way that maximises the revenue associated with
generating the ROCs available to Drax Power Station as a whole under the RO Scheme. Under the current
RO Scheme, three of our generation units converted to biomass are eligible to receive ROCs until March
2027. For further information on the RO Scheme and the CfD Regime, see “Industry Overview—
_Overview of the Electricity Market Reform—Contracts for Difference” and “Industry Overview—UK_
_Clean Energy Legislation—The Renewables Obligation”._

On 31 December 2018, we acquired DGEL, ScottishPower’s 2.6GW portfolio of pumped storage, hydro
and gas-fired generation assets. DGEL includes the Cruachan pumped storage power plant, hydro power
plants at Galloway and Lanark and four CCGT power stations in Southern and Northern England.
Cruachan provides over 35 per cent. of the UK’s pumped-storage capacity and is capable of generating
440MW of large-scale storage and flexible electricity continuously for 16 hours. It also provides
contracted Ancillary Services to the UK electricity system and important system support services through
the balancing market, in addition to merchant power generation. The Galloway and Lanark hydro power

88


-----

plants are capable of generating up to a combined 126MW of stable renewable electricity. Lanark
(17MW) receives regulatory support from the RO Scheme, and Galloway (109MW) receives regulatory
support from the RO Scheme with respect to approximately 28MW of its generating capacity, in addition
to which it operates a reservoir and dam system providing power storage capabilities and opportunities
for peaking and system support services. Our CCGT power stations at Damhead Creek (805MW), Rye
House (715MW), Shoreham (420MW) and Blackburn Mill (60MW) provide baseload and peak power
generation, in addition to other system support services. The multi-site, multi-technology nature of this
2.6GW portfolio of generation assets significantly diversifies our generation capacity, expands our
flexible, low-carbon and renewable generation model and increases our ability to provide system support
services to the UK energy system. The System Operator has a growing need for system support services
and we have a number of contracts in place with the System Operator to supply such services.

Furthermore, we are progressing the development of options for four new 299MW OCGT plants in
England and Wales. As part of the DGEL Acquisition, the Group also acquired a permitted option for the
development of a 1.8GW CCGT plant at Damhead Creek (Damhead Creek II). Each of these plants has
the potential to provide flexible and reliable electricity to the UK electricity system and diversify our
future energy generation capability subject to a positive investment decision and appropriate support
through the Capacity Market (if and when re-established). If commissioned, each of these plants would
provide fast, flexible gas generation to support the UK electricity system at times of peak demand.

We are also developing options to repower one or both of our remaining coal-fired generation units to gas
and build supporting battery storage at Drax Power Station. The project could replace the existing
c.1.3GW of coal-fired generation capacity with up to 3.6GW of gas generation capacity (capable of
running in either open cycle and combined cycle modes) and up to 200MW of supporting battery storage,
subject to a positive investment decision, obtaining consent and other approvals and the award of one or
more 15-year Capacity Market agreements or similar support in future Capacity Market auctions subject
to the Capacity Market being re-established.

- B2B Energy Supply: We supply electricity to businesses through Haven Power and electricity and gas to
businesses through Opus. Both Haven Power and Opus provide us with a credit-efficient route to market
for a proportion of the electricity we generate and the ROCs that our Power Generation segment earns.
The majority of Haven Power’s sales volumes are with larger I&C customers, while Opus is focused on
SMEs. Our B2B Energy Supply segment is the fifth largest supplier of electricity to businesses in the UK
by volume supplied as of 31 October 2018 and the largest provider of renewable energy to businesses. In
2018 we supplied 17.9 TWh of electricity, representing an 11 per cent. share of the B2B electricity
market.

- Pellet Production: Through our Pellet Production segment based in the US Gulf region, we manufacture
and supply compressed wood pellets from sustainably managed forests. We take low-grade wood and
residues from other wood processing and forestry industries and transform them into pellets that can be
transported cost-effectively to Drax Power Station to generate low-carbon energy. We operate three wood
pellet manufacturing facilities in the US Gulf region: Amite BioEnergy in Gloster, Mississippi,
Morehouse BioEnergy in Bastrop, Louisiana and LaSalle BioEnergy in Urania, Louisiana. In 2018, our
wood pellet manufacturing facilities produced approximately 1,351,000 tonnes of sustainable biomass,
representing 18.0 per cent. of our internal requirements for generation from sustainable biomass,
compared to production of approximately 822,000 tonnes being 12.3 per cent. of our internal
requirements in 2017. This increase was driven by the successful commissioning of our LaSalle facility
which has annual nameplate production capacity of 450,000 tonnes and achieved full production ahead of
schedules in 2018, an increase in annual production capacity of 75,000 tonnes at each of our Amite and
Morehouse facilities in 2017. This nameplate capacity of 1,500,000 tonnes gives us the capability to
supply a greater share of our internal requirements for generation from sustainable biomass in 2019. We
aim to increase the share of internally sourced pellets to up to 30 per cent. in the future, as part of our
broader initiative to reduce operating costs by leveraging the vertically integrated nature of our
operations. To that end, we are increasing capacity at our LaSalle and Morehouse facilities by 175,000
tonnes in aggregate by 2021. All three of our wood pellet manufacturing facilities are certified under the
Sustainable Biomass Program, an industry standard, demonstrating that their biomass is legally and
sustainably sourced. We operate a 2,700,000 tonne port facility in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, which
includes two 40,000 tonne storage domes to transport pellets from our own manufacturing facilities and
from approved third party suppliers to the UK for use by our Power Generation segment. The port facility
can load more than 15,000 tonnes of pellets per day and can accommodate 60,000 tonne Panamax

89


-----

Vessels. In 2018, we also started construction of a new rail spur linking our LaSalle facility to the
regional rail network and our port facility at Baton Rouge, which will increase transportation efficiency
and economies of scale and reduce the cost and carbon footprint of our operations.

**Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations**

Our operating results are affected by a combination of economic, regulatory and industry- and companyspecific factors. Economic conditions influence electricity demand, the pricing of fuel, electricity and other
commodities and emissions allowances, which affect both our revenues and the costs associated with our
operations. The regulatory framework determines the parameters in which the industry, generally, and we,
specifically, operate. Industry-specific factors include technology, competition, capacity, government subsidy
programs and supply/demand balance. Factors that specifically impact our operating results include, but are not
limited to, acquisitions, plant reliability and efficiency, capital expenditure levels, the ability to benefit from
subsidies for the generation of electricity from renewable sources, the ability to receive revenues from the
provision of Ancillary Services and the Capacity Market and the extent to which we have hedged our exposure to
commodity and foreign exchange risks. The most important of such factors are discussed below.

**_DGEL Acquisition_**

On 31 December 2018, we acquired DGEL, a UK electricity generation business which owns and operates a
portfolio of pumped storage, hydro and gas-fired electricity generation assets, including Cruachan power plant,
one of only four pumped storage assets in the UK, hydro assets in Lanark and Galloway, and gas-fired CCGT
power stations at Damhead Creek, Rye House and Shoreham in the south of England and Blackburn Mill in the
North. DGEL also owns SMW Limited, a company operating a biomass-from-waste facility on the outskirts of
Glasgow. The assets and liabilities acquired have been included in Drax’s consolidated balance sheet at
31 December 2018. Due to the timing of the DGEL Acquisition, no income, expenditure or cash flows are
included in Drax’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended 31 December 2018 in respect of
the DGEL Group. Furthermore, neither the £550 million drawn under the 2018 Bridge Facility after the balance
sheet date on 2 January 2019 nor the £137 million reduction in cash of in respect of the consideration paid are
reflected in our consolidated net debt as at 31 December 2018. In 2019, we expect to incur modest integration
costs in respect of DGEL, and we expect to benefit from cost-reduction synergies by reducing corporate overhead
costs for the acquired business. See “Our Business—Power Generation—DGEL: General” for more information
regarding the DGEL Group.

Both the revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of DGEL Group were relatively flat from 2016 to 2017, as a
decrease in generation due to the major planned outage on a transformer at Cruachan was offset by an increase in
revenues from Ancillary Services in addition to the receipt of £3.9 million of Capacity Market Payments in 2017
compared to £nil in 2016. From 2017 to 2018, the revenue of DGEL Group declined primarily as a result of
lower commodity prices. However, the Adjusted EBITDA of DGEL Group increased as a result of an increase in
Ancillary Services income at the Cruachan pumped storage power plant. For the year ended 31 December 2018,
the Acquired Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of the DGEL Group were £573.6 million and £77.2 million,
respectively. For the year ended 31 December 2018, electricity sales accounted for approximately three quarters
of DGEL Group’s revenue with the bulk its remaining revenue deriving from the provision of Ancillary
Services. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS Measures”.

**_Other Acquisitions, Dispositions and Pellet Production Investments_**

On 10 February 2017, we acquired Opus, a UK retail energy business supplying electricity and gas mainly
to SME-customers. As of that date we began consolidating Opus’ financial results in our financial results. The
acquisition of Opus provided us with an additional credit-efficient route to sell electricity from our Power
Generation segment in the market. As a retail business, Opus is less capital intensive than our Power Generation
segment. Within the B2B Energy Supply segment, Opus is focused on the SME market, which is characterised
by lower consumption per customer and higher gross margins compared to the more competitive I&C market,
from which Haven Power derives the majority of its sales. Opus also acquires electricity for supply through
electricity purchase agreements with over two thousand small renewable generators. See “Our Business—B2B
_Energy Supply—Opus” for more information regarding Opus._

In 2015, we acquired Billington Bioenergy, a UK wood pellet retail business which was a part of our B2B
Energy Supply segment. In October 2017, we completed the sale of Billington Bioenergy to Aggregated Micro
Power Holdings plc, recognising a loss on disposal of £3.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2017 in
connection with the sale.

Beginning in 2014, we have also invested in the construction of two wood pellet manufacturing facilities,
Amite and Morehouse, near Bastrop, Louisiana and Gloster, Mississippi and related US port infrastructure. These
two wood pellet manufacturing facilities commenced commercial operations in 2015 and supply our Power
Generation segment with wood pellets under long-term fixed price contracts. In April 2017, as part of our
strategy to supply Drax Power Station with up to 30 per cent. of its annual demand for wood pellets from our
own production, we completed the acquisition of the LaSalle wood pellet manufacturing facility located in
Louisiana, which was fully commissioned in 2018 and has a nameplate production capacity of 450,000 tonnes.
These three facilities produced approximately 1,351,000 tonnes of pellets in 2018 compared to approximately
822,000 tonnes of pellets in 2017, up 64 per cent. year-on-year. During 2017 we also installed and commissioned
150,000 tonnes of additional total capacity at our Amite and Morehouse facilities, increasing nameplate capacity
at each facility to 525,000 tonnes per annum and allowing us to receive and process a greater amount of lower
cost residues from commercial forestry processes, reducing our overall biomass cost.

**_Sources of Gross Profit_**

_Bark Spread, Clean Spark Spread, Dark Green Spread, Hydro and Pumped Storage_

The core elements to our Power Generation gross profit are the “bark spread” for electricity generated from
biomass, the “clean spark spread” for electricity generated from gas, the “dark green spread” for electricity
generated from coal and revenues (mainly power sales) from our hydro and pumped storage facilities.

The “bark spread” is the wholesale electricity price plus renewable support, less the cost of sustainable
biomass. The cost of sustainable biomass is the gross cost of purchasing the fuel, which includes the cost of the
raw material, processing costs, logistics, handling and storage costs, and is influenced by exchange rates where
the fuel is contracted in a foreign currency. The renewable support reflects the value of the ROCs earned and
payments under the CfD Regime through generating electricity from burning sustainable biomass. As a
renewable fuel, biomass is exempt from the EU ETS and Carbon Price Support.

The “clean spark spread” is the difference between the wholesale electricity price and the cost of gas and
carbon, including emission allowances under the EU ETS and Carbon Price Support. The cost of gas and
emissions allowances is dependent on market prices at the time the purchases are secured, typically at the same
time the power sales take place.

The “dark green spread” is the difference between the wholesale electricity price and the cost of coal and
carbon, including emissions allowances under the EU ETS and the Carbon Price Support. The cost of coal and
emissions allowances is driven by market prices at the time the purchases are secured.

Revenues from our hydro assets primarily reflect power sales from levels of electricity generation, which is
dependent on rainfall levels and river management, and the wholesale electricity price plus renewable support
under the ROC Scheme. There is no cost of fuel associated with our hydro assets. The core margin from our
Cruachan pumped storage power plant is the difference between prices achieved through the generation of
electricity and the cost of pumping to refill the reservoir at times of low demand.

_Generation Capacity, System Support and the Capacity Market_

With increasing levels of intermittent generation we are continuing to identify opportunities to create value
from our ability to flexibly operate our generation assets according to prevailing market conditions. This will
include short-term power and balancing market activity, the provision of Ancillary Services and the increased
margin achieved from coal-fired generation due to the use of out-of-specification fuels. To capture value in this
market we continue to focus resources on optimising availability and flexibility of all of our generation assets,
including the coal and biomass-fired generation units at Drax Power Station as well as the assets we acquired in
connection with the DGEL Acquisition.

We compete with other generators for Ancillary Services contracts. Our revenues from Ancillary Services
amounted to £18.8 million in 2018 compared to £30.7 million in 2017 and £47.3 million in 2016. The decrease in
2018 was primarily due to a specific Ancillary Services contract in 2016-2017 which did not extend into 2018.
The decrease in 2017 was primarily due to the expiry of a one-year Ancillary Services contract.

From 2017, revenues from short-term power and balancing market activity, the provision of Ancillary
Services and the use of out-of-specification fuels in our coal-fired generation assets have been combined into the
key performance indicator, “value from flexibility”, and is tracked on this basis. In total, our value from
flexibility was £79.0 million and £88.0 million for the years ended 31 December 2018 and 2017, respectively.

91


-----

Under a Capacity Market agreement, a generator is entitled to fixed monthly payments in exchange for a
commitment to deliver energy during a system stress event, which occurs when the System Operator has to resort
to emergency actions in order to balance supply. Our revenue from the Capacity Market was £3.0 million and
£8.5 million for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2018, respectively. Prior to the DGEL Acquisition, the
DGEL Group received £3.9 million and £11.7 million in Capacity Market revenues for the years ended
31 December 2017 and 2018, respectively.

In November 2018, the General Court of the European Union imposed a “standstill period” in respect of the
Capacity Market while the European Commission completes a state aid investigation into the Capacity Market.
Payments to generators under existing Capacity Market agreements and the holding of future capacity auctions
have been suspended. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—The Capacity Market in
_the UK is currently suspended and its future is uncertain”._

In Power Generation we again met our obligation to provide capacity but did not receive or accrue the
revenue expected from this activity during the final three months of the year due to the suspension of the
Capacity Market. In B2B Energy Supply we provided for all costs associated with the Capacity Market in 2018.
Our approach was based on continuing to include charges in customer bills, with cash collected from those
customers during the period. The net impact of the Capacity Market suspension in 2018 was a decrease of
£7 million to our Adjusted EBITDA.

Assuming reinstatement of the Capacity Market on the same or similar terms as existed prior to the General
Court’s judgment, our Power Generation segment expects to receive £68 million of capacity payment revenues
relating to 2019. Of this, up to £47 million is derived from DGEL. As part of the DGEL Acquisition we agreed a
compensation mechanism with ScottishPower Generation Holdings, the previous owner of DGEL. As part of this
mechanism, in the event that capacity payments are not received in full in respect of DGEL Assets in for the nine
months ended 30 September 2019, the mechanism provides, subject to gross margin thresholds, up to £26 million
of payments to be made in favour of Drax. The agreement also provides for payments of up to £26 million to
ScottishPower Generation Holdings by Drax Smart Generation Holdco Limited, if capacity payments through
30 September 2019 are not received in full, in the event that DGEL’s gross profit for 2019 is better than
expected. Any such payments, if made, will constitute cash adjustments to the DGEL Acquisition consideration
and would not form part of Adjusted EBITDA.

Our view that the Capacity Market will be re-established on the same or similar terms is consistent with the
position expressed by the Government. We expect the issue to be resolved during 2019.

**_Factors Affecting Gross Margins_**

_Electricity prices_

The wholesale electricity price is affected by a variety of factors, including the price of underlying
commodities such as oil, natural gas and emissions allowances, the availability of generating capacity (and, in
particular, the level of intermittent generation from sources such as wind and solar compared to baseload
generation from gas and nuclear power stations), the level of demand and wider macroeconomic conditions.
These factors together determine the “marginal plant”, which drives the wholesale electricity price. A power
station’s cost of generation is determined largely by the cost of the type of fuel used, which can be susceptible to
market forces and vary significantly. Some power producers have negative marginal costs of generation, such as
those which generate electricity using wind or solar, as the renewable support provided to these renewable
generators exceeds the cost of generation.

Power plants can be modelled, according to their different costs of generation, as a stack, which is overlaid
with forecasted demand for electricity. The available power producers are drawn on to generate electricity to
fulfil this demand, starting with those that have the lowest costs of generation. At the point in the demand stack
where forecast demand intersects with available supply, the type of generator supplying electricity at the point of
intersection is known as the “marginal plant”. The price at which the marginal power plant is willing to generate
therefore dictates the overall market price.

Since 2016, we have seen significant volatility in the electricity price. This is largely attributable to
increases in the cost of carbon and fluctuations in gas prices. The cost of carbon for fossil fuel generators
increased as a result of a significant increase in the price of emissions allowances under the EU ETS, from
approximately €4 per tonne of CO2 in September 2016 to over €25 per tonne of CO2 in April 2019. Gas prices
initially increased due to low storage levels following a cold winter in 2017 as well as low levels of LNG
deliveries and subsequently increased following a mild winter in 2018 with high storage levels and a regular

92


-----

supply of LNG vessels. Additionally, the high levels of intermittent generation capacity on the system results in
thermal generation being displaced in some periods (by generation without a cost of fuel, e.g. wind generation)
but being required in others.

As of 20 February 2019, we had contracted fixed price power sales (including both forward sold electricity
and proxy gas hedges) of approximately 16.3 TWh, 8.9 TWh and 3.4 TWh for delivery in 2019, 2020 and 2021,
respectively. Average achieved prices for fixed price power sales of forward sold electricity in 2019, 2020 and
2021 were £55.9 per MWh, £53.3 per MWh and £50.1 per MWh, respectively. During periods of low electricity
prices, the electricity price that we can achieve in the market may not cover our costs of fuel and, in the case of
generation from coal and gas, the cost of carbon. As a result, it may be more economical for us to idle, or reduce
the load factor on, all or some of our generating assets. The continuing increase in generation from intermittent
renewables such as wind or solar power combined with the continuing decrease in available conventional
generation capacity due to the retirement of older, less efficient and mostly coal-fired power stations also results
in more volatile wholesale electricity prices. This volatility presents an opportunity for generators like us that can
produce significant amounts of electricity at relatively short notice at times of peak demand, for example at times
of lower production from intermittent renewables due to adverse weather conditions. We expect that the
increasing trend of intermittent renewables generation coupled with a decrease in conventional generation, in
particular from coal-fired power stations (given the Government’s intention to end electricity generation from
unabated coal by 2025), will continue in the short-to-medium term and will continue to contribute to, less
liquidity in forward wholesale markets and more volatile wholesale electricity prices in the UK generally.

_Fuel and carbon prices_

The spot market prices for wood pellets increased in 2017 and 2018, which represented a change from the
overall downward trend in coal and biomass prices through 2015 and 2016. We were partially protected from this
increase in price by our focus on long-term contracts and self-supply. Our average cost of fuel, before the impact
of costs of emissions allowances, the Carbon Price Support and ROC support, was approximately £61.3 per
MWh in 2018 compared with approximately £51.8 per MWh in 2016, primarily reflecting our shift from coal to
biomass fuelled generation, as the biomass required to generate a MWh of electricity is more expensive than the
coal required to generate the same amount of electricity.

We are generally protected from short-term volatility in foreign exchange rates, due to having an active
rolling five-year foreign exchange hedging programme with respect to the currencies in which fuel and carbon
prices are denominated (predominantly US dollars, Canadian dollars and euro). Additionally, our focus on longterm contracts and self-supply, which enables an ability to adjust production at our self-supplied biomass to take
advantage of attractively priced spot cargoes, provides protection from fluctuations in raw materials prices.

The cost of carbon in the dark green spread is made up of two elements, the cost of emissions allowances
under the EU ETS and Carbon Price Support. The market price of emissions allowances under the EU ETS
increased significantly in 2018 relative to 2017 in anticipation of the introduction of the Market Stability Reserve
in January 2019 which aims to address the current surplus of allowances by reducing the supply of allowances to
be auctioned. New market entrants and the switching of generation from gas to coal by some generators due to
high gas prices also contributed to the increased market price of emissions allowances. The average cost of
emissions allowances in support of coal-fired generation was approximately £5 per MWh in 2018 compared to
approximately £6 per MWh in 2016. The Carbon Price Support rate for the first year of operation
(2013/2014) was £4.94/tonne, increasing to £9.55/tonne in 2014/2015 and £18.08/tonne in 2015/16; however, the
Carbon Price Support price has been capped at £18/tonne from 2016 until 2021. In January 2019, the
Government reaffirmed that the UK will continue to maintain a total carbon price (the combined Carbon Price
Support and the EU ETS) until such time as unabated coal-fired generation in the UK has ceased. If the UK
leaves the EU without an agreement as to the terms of its withdrawal (i.e. a “no deal” scenario), the Government
has confirmed that the UK would cease to participate in the EU ETS and a carbon emissions tax would be
introduced to help meet the UK’s legally binding carbon reduction commitments under the Climate Change Act
2008. For 2019, a rate of £16 would be applied to each tonne of carbon dioxide exceeding an installation’s
emissions allowance, which would be based on the installation’s free allowance allocation under the EU ETS.
When added to the current Carbon Price Support, this would increase the UK’s total carbon emissions tax to
£34 per tonne, compensating for the loss of the EU ETS.

**_Generation Levels and Availability_**

We receive a significant proportion of our revenues from wholesale electricity sales from Drax Power
Station, and for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, from wholesale electricity sales from the

93


-----

generation facilities acquired in connection with the DGEL Acquisition, in particular our Damhead Creek and
Shoreham CCGT power stations. Our revenues are therefore affected by the amount of generation at these
facilities, which is in turn underpinned by the availability of these facilities to generate when market conditions
dictate that it is economic to do so. Availability of the generating units at Drax Power Station and our recently
acquired DGEL Assets is impacted by planned maintenance outages, as well as unplanned or forced outages,
which are required from time to time to rectify malfunctions or other failures, or other safety-related incidents.
Each of our six generation units at Drax Power Station and each of our gas-fired units typically has a planned
outage every four years and these outages are usually scheduled for the summer months, when electricity demand
and power prices are lower. In the UK power generation industry, the “summer” season comprises the calendar
months April to September, and the “winter” season comprises the calendar months October to March. Our
maintenance regime for the traditional turbine generator assets at our hydro facilities typically includes annual
inspections, minor planned outages every four years and major planned outages every 12 years to complement a
routine preventative maintenance regime.

We currently plan to undertake a major planned outage on our fourth biomass unit commencing late April
2019, followed by a major outage on our second biomass unit commencing July 2019. We also expect to
undertake a planned outage at our Rye House CCGT power station and a minor inspection at our Damhead Creek
CCGT power station during 2019. We expect that none of these outages will have a notable impact on
profitability (excluding operating expenditure) given that generation from our biomass units is commercially
constrained by the operation of the ROC cap and the seasonality of the outages, which are concentrated in
summer months when electricity demand is lower. We also sometimes experience unplanned outages. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—We are dependent on continued output from our_
_facilities, in particular Drax Power Station, and outages at Drax Power Station or any of our other facilities_
_could negatively affect our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations”._

During 2018, Drax Power Station generated approximately 18.3 TWh of electricity compared to 20.0 TWh
in 2017. The availability for 2018 was impacted by unplanned outages during the first quarter of 2018 due to a
fire in December 2017 in our biomass rail unloading facilities and an unplanned outage on one of our biomass
units. The combination of these events led to lower biomass generation in the first quarter of 2018 than the first
quarter of 2017. Availability for 2018 was also impacted by a planned outage of one coal unit and the conversion
of a fourth unit from coal to biomass. The availability for 2017 was impacted by a significant planned outage on
our generation unit that receives support under the CfD Regime, as well as an unplanned outage in December
2017 leading to reduced generation from our biomass-fired units as a result of the aforementioned fire in our
biomass rail unloading facilities. The availability for 2016 reflected a particularly busy maintenance schedule
that included planned outages on two of the six generation units (one of which took longer than anticipated due to
an unplanned equipment failure), as well as four shorter outages for essential repair works.

**_Regulation_**

_Renewables_

Revenue from three of our four biomass-fired generation units at Drax Power Station is supported by the RO
Scheme, with the remaining unit being supported by the CfD Regime. Our Galloway and Lanark hydro assets
acquired as part of the DGEL Acquisition are also supported by the RO Scheme, though the Galloway hydro
facility receives ROCs only with respect to approximately 28MW of its 109MW capacity, with the remainder
being available for participation in the Capacity Market. The RO Scheme is a market-based mechanism that was
introduced in 2002 to support the deployment of large scale renewable energy in the UK. The RO Scheme
requires licensed electricity suppliers to submit a specified number of ROCs to Ofgem per MWh of electricity
they supply or to make a buy-out payment (which increases annually in line with the UK Retail Price Index).
ROCs are issued by Ofgem to accredited renewables generators for each MWh of renewable electricity
generated. The number of ROCs received by a generator per MWh of electricity produced differs depending on
the type of renewable generation technology utilised. We receive one ROC per MWh of electricity generated
from each of our units that is supported by the RO Scheme, though Drax Power Station is subject to an overall
station-level ROC cap. This cap is set annually at such a level that the incremental amount of ROCs received by
Drax Power Station as a result of the recent conversion of a fourth unit to biomass is and will continue to be
lower than the average number of ROCs we had received in generation from the first two units we converted to
biomass under the RO Scheme. Each of our facilities currently supported under the RO Scheme is eligible to
receive ROCs until March 2027, at which point we will lose support under this regime. For more information on
ROCs, see “Industry Overview—UK clean energy legislation—Operation of the Renewables Obligation” and
“Risk Factors—Risk Factors Relating to Our Business and Industry—The reduction or abandonment of

94


-----

_governmental support for generation of electricity from biomass or other relevant changes in governmental_
_energy policy may materially adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition and results of_
_operations”._

ROCs are tradable certificates that have no fixed price so the amount an electricity supplier pays for a ROC
is negotiated between the generator and supplier. However, the buy-out payment that a supplier would have to
make if it failed to present a sufficient number of ROCs to Ofgem effectively sets a price cap on ROCs and
historically the purchase price paid to generators by suppliers has been marginally lower than the buy-out
payment. Each ROC is also entitled to a share of the buy-out fund, in which all buy-out payments from suppliers
are pooled and then recycled back to suppliers in proportion to the number of ROCs they have validly submitted
toward discharging their obligation in the relevant period. Many of our contracts for the sale of ROCs to
suppliers contain a provision that requires the supplier to pass the recycle payment received by the supplier
following submission of the ROC to Ofgem on to us.

Revenues from the external sale of ROCs amounted to £664.5 million, £367.8 million and £366.7 million in
2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. External ROC sales increased significantly in 2018 a result of a combination
of the increase in market prices and actions taken to accelerate the timing of cash flows from ROCs. Where we
choose to sell ROCs to accelerate cash flows, we may choose to purchase ROCs at a later date for submission by
our B2B Energy Supply segment, ultimately leading to a similar offsetting charge in cost of sales.

Following its approval by the European Commission on 19 December 2016, our CfD for electricity
produced by our third biomass-fired generation unit became effective. Our CfD provides a variable top-up to a
reference price which reflects average wholesale electricity prices over a certain period. Our CfD was entered
into between Drax Power as a renewable electricity generator and the Low Carbon Contracts Company Limited,
a limited company owned by the Government (the “LCCC”), as the CfD counterparty, under which payments are
made by reference to a fixed price for each MWh of electricity produced, known as the “strike price”. Our CfD
has a term until 2027, at which time biomass generation will cease to be supported under the CfD scheme, and as
of 1 April 2019 provided for a strike price of £113.65 per MWh compared to a strike price of £111.29 per MWh
as of 1 April 2018. The strike price is adjusted annually on 1 April to reflect consumer price inflation and system
balancing costs in the UK. Under the CfD, we sell the electricity in the wholesale market and when the reference
price (which is an average price and therefore not directly related to the price at which we sell the underlying
electricity) is below the strike price, we receive a top-up payment from the LCCC for the additional amount we
generate and when the reference price is above the strike price, we must pay back the difference it generates to
the LCCC.

_Conventional generation_

In January 2018, the Government reaffirmed its intention to phase out electricity generation from coal by
2025 in order to reduce overall carbon dioxide emissions, and announced the introduction of an emissions
intensity limit, which, if enacted, will make generation from unabated coal units uneconomic. Against the
background of these plans, we expect that electricity generation from coal at Drax Power Station will end by
2025. Accordingly, we decided to adopt a more focused and tailored maintenance plan for our coal-fired
generation units, which is expected to lead to lower maintenance capital expenditure on these units compared to
our historical maintenance capital expenditure. The Power Generation business managed a major outage of one
of the coal-fired generation units in early 2018. Furthermore, we accelerated the depreciation of the coal-specific
assets at Drax Power Station in 2017. In August 2018 we completed the conversion of a fourth generating unit
from coal to biomass, leading us to write down £27 million in coal-specific assets in relation to this unit for the
year ended 31 December 2018. Coal-specific assets include those assets that are only useful for as long as the
unconverted generation units are coal-fired (such as the coal transportation system), but not the generation units
themselves. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—
_Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Capital and Operating Expenditure” for a discussion of our_
exploration of coal-to-gas repowering and battery storage technology for the remaining coal-fired generation
units.

The IED sets an annual limit on the amount of NOx and SO2 that we can emit from Drax Power Station and
our CCGT power stations acquired as part of the DGEL Acquisition. This limit is provided in the form of
allowances. We must either ensure that the generation profile of our thermal generation assets operates within
this limit or else purchase surplus allowances from other generators equal to the excess. Our thermal generation
assets are also subject to short-term (24-hourly and monthly) emission limit values for SO2, NOx and particulate
matter. These limits reflect achievable emissions rates from plants such as Drax Power Station and our CCGT
power stations, and each of our facilities remains compliant with them.

95


-----

We are focused on meeting the requirements of the Best Available Techniques Reference Document for
Large Combustion Plants, published in August 2017 (BREF). BREF will further reduce air emission limits when
it enters into force on or prior to 2021.

The type and quality of fuel used in generation (particularly the quality of coal) and the load factor of the
generation units have an impact on the amount of NOx and other gases released by Drax Power Station and our
CCGT power stations. We also have selective non-catalytic reduction technology fitted to five of Drax Power
Station’s six generation units which can be turned on (at a cost) to reduce NOx emissions. However, ultimately if
Drax Power Station or one of our CCGT power stations were about to exceed one of the applicable annual limits
and we were unable to acquire the relevant additional emissions allowances from the market, we would have to
reduce the level of otherwise profitable generation.

**_Capital and Operating Expenditure_**

Since 2012, we have made significant investments and incurred the corresponding capital expenditure. Our
non-recurring capital expenditures in this period have mainly related to the conversion of the first three
generation units at Drax Power Station to biomass and the investment in two US wood pellet manufacturing
facilities and the associated transport infrastructure, spending more than £650 million on these projects. In
addition, following the Government’s consultation on an end to unabated electricity generation from coal by
2025, we completed the conversion of a further coal-fired generation unit to biomass in August 2018 at a cost of
approximately £30 million (which was lower than the cost of converting each of the previous three biomass-fired
generation units). We are separately developing options for coal-to-gas repowering and supporting battery
storage technology for the remaining two coal-fired generation units at Drax Power Station. Accordingly, we
have adapted the maintenance and upgrade schedule for our remaining coal-fired generation units and expect our
annual maintenance capital expenditures with respect to these units to continue to be lower than those seen in
past years.

Our recurring capital expenditure is concentrated in the Power Generation segment. In contrast, the
operations of the Pellet Production segment and the B2B Energy Supply segment require relatively small
amounts of maintenance capital expenditure. Within the Power Generation segment, recurring capital
expenditures mainly relate to scheduled maintenance work, periodic replacements and unscheduled repairs. See
also “—Depreciation of Coal Specific Assets” below.

See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Capital Expenditure” for a discussion our expectations relating to
future capital expenditure.

Our results of operations are also affected by our operating and administrative expenses. In the years ended
31 December 2018, 2017 and 2016 operating and administrative expenses were £320.0 million, £297.4 million
and £236.3 million, respectively. The increase in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to a full year of costs
in respect of Opus and the increase in output in our Pellet Production segment, partially offset by a reduction in
central administrative expenditure. The increase in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to the acquisition
of Opus, along with increased expenses associated with expansion in capacity in our wood pellet manufacturing
business and an increase in central administrative expenses resulting from increased investment in strategic,
innovation and development activities. In 2019, we expect our operating and administrative expenses to increase
due to our acquisition of DGEL on 31 December 2018 and to increased pellet production at our LaSalle facility,
but we otherwise expect operating and administrative expenses to be broadly aligned with 2018. Our operating
and administrative expenditure for 2016 included impairment charges in respect of trade receivables. However,
following the implementation of IFRS 9 we now present such charges in a separate line in the income statement.
The impact of impairment charges in respect of trade receivables on our results for the years 2017 (restated) and
2018 was £18.7 million and £31.4 million, respectively.

**_Derivative Financial Instruments_**

We are exposed to commodity price, foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate and inflation rate risks in
the course of our business and financing activities. We seek to hedge our exposure to these risks by entering into
derivative financial instruments where deemed appropriate. For example, as of 31 December 2018, 2017 and
2016 we had outstanding derivative financial instruments with an aggregate notional value (based on the
undiscounted net cash inflows/outflows) of £4,821.5 million, £4,856.7 million and £3,510.3 million, respectively.

During 2018, the pound sterling depreciated significantly in part due to uncertainty around the UK’s
withdrawal from the European Union, largely reversing the gains in the value of the pound sterling in 2017. As
we had hedged significant parts of our exposure from fuel purchases, the market value of our derivative assets

96


-----

was positively affected by these shifts in exchange rates and we recognised a non-cash, unrealised gain in our
income statement, cost of hedging reserve and hedge reserve as of and for the year ended 31 December 2018 as a
result of the higher mark-to-market values of these hedging arrangements at year-end relative to the beginning of
the year.

During 2017, the pound sterling appreciated significantly particularly against the US dollar, largely
reversing the losses in the value of the pound sterling sustained in 2016 that resulted, in part, from the UK’s
referendum on withdrawing from the European Union. As we had hedged significant parts of our exposure from
fuel purchases to the US dollar, the market value of our derivative assets was adversely affected by these shifts in
exchange rates and we recognised a non-cash, unrealised losses in our income statement and hedge reserves as of
and for the year ended 31 December 2017 as a result of the lower mark-to-market values of these hedging
arrangements at year-end relative to the beginning of the year.

During 2016, the pound sterling depreciated significantly against other major currencies such as the
US dollar, the euro and the Canadian dollar. As we had hedged significant parts of our exposure from fuel
emissions allowances and other purchases in these currencies, we recognised significant balance sheet gains from
higher mark-to-market values of these hedging arrangements.

We are extensively hedged against foreign currency volatility until the end of 2024, and through our
five-year rolling hedging we continue to secure certainty over our FX exposures over this period. Should there be
any renewed and prolonged weakness in the pound sterling, it may lead to higher fuel prices for us.

**_Seasonality_**

Our primary activities are affected by seasonality. Demand in the UK for electricity and gas is typically
higher, and thus drives higher electricity prices and dispatch, in the winter period (October to March) when
temperatures are colder. Conversely, demand is typically lower in the summer months (April to September),
when prices are lower. This trend is experienced by all of our UK-based businesses, as they variously operate
within the UK electricity and gas markets, and is most notable within our Power Generation segment due to its
scale and the flexible operation of coal-fired plants when prices are low in the summer. The performance of
DGEL’s pumped storage and hydro assets could also be impacted by unseasonal or extreme weather conditions.
Our hydro generation facilities are dependent upon hydrological conditions prevailing from time to time in the
geographic regions in which our hydro facilities are located. Our Pellet Production segment has a regular
production and dispatch schedule, which generally insulates it from demand fluctuations caused by seasonality,
although unseasonably wet weather can reduce the availability of raw materials to produce wood pellets as our
fibre suppliers may experience difficulties or may be unable to access harvesting sites. Overall, as a result of
these seasonal patterns, profit margins are lower in the summer months, partially offset by a related reduction in
working capital requirements, with any fluctuations in our cash flow cycle principally managed through cash at
hand or borrowings under our debt facilities.

**_Depreciation of Coal-Specific Assets_**

During 2016, management assessed the likely future prospects of our existing generation units and took the
decision to reduce the expected remaining useful economic life of coal-specific assets to a long stop date of 2025,
in line with the Government’s stated ambition for the cessation of unabated coal generation. This decision
followed the launch of a public consultation in November 2016 seeking stakeholder feedback on this ambition,
and in January 2018, the Government restated its intention to end unabated coal generation by 2025.

Coal-specific assets include those assets that are only useful for as long as the two unconverted generation
units at Drax Power Station are coal-fired (such as the coal transportation system), but not the actual generation
units as these can potentially be used after 2025. In August 2018, we completed the conversion of our fourth
generating unit from coal to biomass at Drax Power Station, leading us to write down £27 million of coalspecific assets relating to the unit for the year ended 31 December 2018. Excluding this write down, our decision
to reduce the expected remaining useful economic life of coal-specific assets in 2016 increased our annual
depreciation charges by approximately £15 million, and we expect these increased charges to continue until 2025
or, if earlier, the date that coal generation ceases at Drax Power Station. If, prior to either of these dates, we
decide to further reduce the expected remaining useful economic life of our coal-specific assets, our annual
depreciation charges may further increase.

**Significant Factors Affecting Comparability of Financial Information**

**_Application of IFRS 9 and Re-presentation of our Income Statement_**

IFRS 9 Financial Instruments replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement for
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The changes in our accounting policy upon transition to IFRS 9
have been reflected in our financial information for the year ended 31 December 2018. The unaudited
comparative information as of and for the year ended 31 December 2017 included in the Group’s audited
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended 31 December 2018 has been restated to reflect the
accounting policies changes upon transition to IFRS 9, but comparative information for the year ended
31 December 2016 has not been similarly restated. Therefore, any accounting policy changes described under
this heading have been reflected only in the financial information for the years ended 31 December 2017
(restated) and 2018 and have not been reflected in the financial information for the years ended 31 December
2016 and 2017. See “Presentation of Financial Information and Other Information”.

On transition to IFRS 9, the key change in our accounting policy for financial instruments is to recognise the
“cost of hedging” (that is, the change in fair value associated with forward points, including currency basis)
initially in a reserve, rather than the income statement. Amounts are subsequently reclassified from the cost of
hedging reserve and recognised in cost of sales in the same period as the hedged item. The application of this
change in policy to the financial results for the year ended 31 December 2017 resulted in the transfer of
£20.8 million in fair value derivative gains (along with £4.0 million in associated taxes) from the income
statement to the cost of hedging reserve as equity. The net effect of this change was to increase our total loss by
£16.8 million to £167.9 million, with an offsetting increase in reserves of £16.8 million.

In respect of accounting for trade and other receivables, we have applied IFRS 9’s simplified approach to
provisioning and have calculated this using lifetime expected losses. This calculation has had no material impact
on our financial information for the years ended 31 December 2017 (restated) and 2018, respectively, except that
impairment losses on trade receivables are now disclosed in a separate line item (they were previously included
within operational and administrative expenses).

Additionally, we have changed the presentation of the Group’s consolidated income statement for the year
ended 31 December 2018 to include unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts in the line item to which
they relate (revenue or cost of sales, as applicable), instead of in a separate line item below gross profit. In our
financial information for the years ended 31 December 2017 (restated) and 2018, we exclude these gains and
losses on derivative contracts as “certain remeasurements” when presenting our adjusted results. Previously,
including for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2017, we had accounted for gains and losses on derivative
contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting, or for which hedge accounting is not effective, as a separate
line item in the income statement and excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.

**_Suspension of the Capacity Market_**

In November 2018, the General Court of the European Union imposed a “standstill period” in respect of the
Capacity Market while the European Commission completes a state aid investigation into the Capacity Market.
Payments to generators under existing Capacity Market agreements and the holding of future capacity auctions
have been suspended. Our view that the Capacity Market will be re-established on the same or similar terms is
consistent with the position expressed by the Government, and we expect the issue to be resolved during 2019.
The net impact of the Capacity Market suspension in 2018 was a decrease of £7 million to our Adjusted
EBITDA. See “—Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Generation Capacity and System
_Support” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating To Our Business And Industry—The Capacity Market in the UK is_
_currently suspended and its future is uncertain”._

**_Acquisitions, Dispositions and Pellet Production Investments_**

The comparability of our financial information from year to year is affected by the acquisitions, dispositions
and pellet production investments we have made since 1 January 2016. For more information as to the effect of
these initiatives on our financial results, see “—Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations—DGEL
_Acquisition” and “—Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Other Acquisitions, Dispositions and_
_Pellet Production Investments._

**_Contract for Difference_**

Effective 19 December 2016 and following the state aid approval by the European Commission, electricity
generated in our third biomass-fired generation unit is supported by the CfD Regime. Our CfD has a term until

98


-----

31 March 2027 and as of 1 April 2019 provides for a strike price of £113.65 per MWh. The strike price is
adjusted annually on 1 April to reflect the consumer price index and system balancing costs in the UK. Based on
average realised electricity prices since 2016, we expect our CfD to continue to contribute significantly to our
revenue and gross profit going forward, providing increased visibility and stability of earnings.

**_Tax_**

The reduction in US federal tax rates to 21 per cent. from 1 January 2018 resulted in a one-off non-cash
deferred tax charge of £16 million for the year ended 31 December 2017 due to the reduction in the net deferred
tax asset held principally in respect of built up start-up losses for the US Pellet businesses. This change in tax
rates will reduce cash taxes payable by our businesses that are subject to US taxation once the start-up losses
have been utilised, which we expect to occur before 2030. Additionally, in the UK, we received agreement from
the tax authorities of a patent box claim with respect to the biomass generation business for which we obtained a
tax credit of £10.3 million in 2017 and a cash benefit of £7.4 million in 2018, in addition to a reduced UK
corporation tax rate on any profits relating to this patent going forward. Under the UK Patent Box tax regime, the
Group can pay corporate taxes at a lower rate (10 per cent) on profits which arise from the use of patented
innovation.

**_IFRS 16_**

We adopted IFRS 16 with effect from 1 January 2019. See “—Recent Accounting Announcements” for an
explanation of how the adoption of this standard is expected to affect our financial statements in future periods.

**Key Performance Indicators**

Our management uses a number of key financial and non-financial performance indicators to track the
performance of our business. The principal key performance indicators we monitor are Adjusted Revenue,
Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted EBITDA, operating cash conversion, and net debt. Additionally, we rely on
biomass unit technical availability (excluding the fourth converted unit) and value from flexibility to track the
performance of our Power Generation segment, growth in market share to track the performance of our B2B
Energy Supply segment and the cost per GJ of biomass produced (in $/GJ) to track the performance of our Pellet
Production segment.

Adjusted Revenue, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted EBITDA, operating cash conversion and net debt are
not accounting measures within the scope of IFRS. For the years ended 31 December 2017 (restated) and 2018,
we define Adjusted Revenue and Adjusted Gross Profit, respectively, as revenue and gross profit, excluding the
impact of certain remeasurements on derivative contracts which cannot be designated as hedging instruments
under IFRS. We define Adjusted EBITDA as profit/loss for the year before interest, tax, depreciation,
amortisation and certain material items that do not reflect the underlying trading performance of the business. For
an explanation of the items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended 31 December 2016, 2017, 2017
(restated) and 2018, see “Presentation of Financial Information and Other Information—Non-IFRS Financial
_Measures”. We define operating cash conversion as net cash generated from operating activities divided by_
Adjusted EBITDA expressed as a percentage. We define net debt as current and non-current borrowings and
overdrafts (net of deferred finance costs) less cash and cash equivalents. See “Presentation of Financial
_Information and Other Information—Non-IFRS Financial and Other Information”._

-----

Beginning in 2017, we separated foreign exchange gains and losses from interest payable and similar charges. The year ended
31 December 2016 has been re-presented to conform to this presentation, consistent with Note 2.5 to the 2017 Drax Group
Audited Financial Statements.

(b) Represents asset obsolescence charges relating to coal-specific assets written-off following the conversion of the fourth unit at
Drax Power Station to run on biomass.

(c) Represents the loss realised on the disposal of multiple immaterial assets compared to the book value of the respective assets. For
the year ended 31 December 2017, also represents the loss realised on the disposal of assets related to Billington Bioenergy
(£3.6 million).

(d) “Unrealised losses/(gains) on derivative contracts” and “certain remeasurements” both represent the effect of changes in fair
value of derivative contracts at the relevant balance sheet date, to the extent such derivatives contracts do not qualify for the own
use exemption or as effective hedges in accordance with IFRS. See “—Description of Key Income Statement Line Items—
_Unrealised gains or losses on derivative contracts” for a discussion of the difference in presentation of these measures._

(e) For the year ended 31 December 2018, represents costs associated with the acquisition and integration of DGEL into the Group
(£21.0 million), closure of our Atlanta, Georgia office to relocate the US head office to Monroe, Louisiana (£3.6 million) and
certain restructuring costs in our B2B business (£3.0 million). For the year ended 31 December 2017, represents the costs
associated with the acquisition and integration of Opus into the Group. In the years 2016 and 2017, this line item was previously
defined as “Acquisition-related costs”.

(f) For the year ended 31 December 2018, represents a credit relating to contingent consideration in connection with our OCGT
projects. For the year ended 31 December 2017, represents unrealised losses on the equity investment in Aggregated Micro
Power Holdings Plc (£0.2 million) as well as a charge relating to contingent consideration payable in connection with our OCGT
projects (£0.2 million).

(7) Biomass unit technical availability measures the percentage of time over a year that our first three biomass units at Drax Power Station
are available to generate electricity. It does not measure the availability of our fourth biomass generation unit, as such unit was not
converted until after mid-2018.

(8) Value from flexibility comprises revenues from short-term power and balancing market activity, and the provision of Ancillary Services
and the use of out-of-specification fuels in our coal-fired generation assets.

(9) Based on management’s assessment of the market.

**Description of Key Income Statement Line Items**

Set forth below is a brief description of the composition of the key line items of our consolidated income
statement.

**_Revenue_**

We adopted IFRS 15 for the first time in 2018. The accounting policies have been updated, however the
amount and timing of revenue recognition in our financial statements is unchanged.

Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods or services provided to customers in the normal course of
business, net of trade discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes and excluding transactions with or between
Drax Group companies. Revenues from the sale of electricity by the Power Generation segment are measured
based upon metered output delivered at rates specified under contract terms or prevailing market rates, as
applicable. Revenues from sales of ROCs are stated at the invoiced value, net of VAT. Revenue is recognised
when the ROC is transferred to a third-party. Income or costs arising from the CfD are recognised in the income
statement as a component of revenue at the point we meet our performance obligations under the CfD contract.

101


-----

Revenue from the sale of electricity and gas directly to business customers through the B2B Energy Supply
segment is recorded after deduction of agreed discounts, VAT and CCL. Revenue is recognised on the supply of
electricity or gas when a contract exists, supply has taken place, a quantifiable price has been established or can
be determined and the receivables are expected to be recovered at the point of sale. Energy supplied, but not yet
measured or billed, is calculated based on consumption statistics and consumption price estimates. Revenues
from the sale of wood pellets in the B2B Energy Supply segment through Billington Bioenergy were recognised
at the point the wood pellets were delivered to the location specified in the contract.

Revenue for contracts satisfied over time is recognised in line with the progress of those contracts. The
measurement of progress is based on cost inputs for fixed price B2B Energy Supply contracts, and volume
supplied for other contracts. Assumptions are applied consistently but third party costs can be variable, therefore
actual outcomes may vary from initial estimates.

Other revenues derived from the provision of services to National Grid (for example, the supply of system
support services) are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contractual performance
obligations. Most such contracts are for the delivery of a service either continually or on an ad hoc basis over a
period of time and thus stage of completion is calculated by reference to the amount of the contract term that has
elapsed. Depending on the contract terms this approach may require judgment in extrapolating probable future
outcomes.

Other revenues derived from the sale of goods (for example, by-products from electricity generation such as
ash and gypsum) are recognised at the point the control of goods is transferred to the customer.

In general, almost all sales of the Pellet Production segment (and all such sales during the years ended
31 December 2018 and 2017) are inter-segment sales which are eliminated upon consolidation.

**_Total cost of sales_**

Total cost of sales consists of the cost of fuel required for electricity generation, the cost of transportation,
the cost of raw materials for the production of wood pellets, the cost of electricity purchases from third-parties,
grid charges payable to the System Operator, the operator of the electricity transmission network in Great Britain,
and other retail costs.

In the Power Generation segment, cost of fuel is the principal driver of total cost of sales and represents the
cost of purchasing the coal (including cost of carbon) and sustainable biomass that is used to generate electricity
in Drax Power Station (net of any ROC support earned). ROCs earned from the biomass-fired generation units
are initially recognised as a reduction in the Power Generation segment’s biomass fuel costs and subsequently
recognised as revenue when the ROC is sold to a third-party. The initial reduction on the fuel costs is recognised
at the point of generation, and the subsequent revenue is recognised at the time of sale of the ROC. The Power
Generation segment also purchases electricity from the market either when it is more economical to do so
because the market price for electricity is lower than our marginal cost of production or when delivery
obligations cannot be met by our own generation. Grid charges mainly comprise distribution, transmission and
system balancing costs.

In the B2B Energy Supply segment cost of sales is mainly driven by electricity purchases. The B2B Energy
Supply segment purchases a significant proportion of its electricity requirement from the Power Generation
segment under intra-group electricity purchase agreements. Other costs of sales include third-party costs such as
grid charges, the costs of meeting our obligations under the RO and small-scale Feed-in-Tariffs (“SS-FiT”)
schemes required to demonstrate the supply of renewable source electricity, CCL-exempt energy to customers.
Grid charges reflect costs of distribution, transmission and system balancing costs.

In the Pellet Production segment cost of sales is principally influenced by the price and type of raw fibre
used in producing the wood pellets. Our wood pellet manufacturing facilities can process various types of raw
fibre from primary sources (such as thinnings, tops and harvesting residues) or secondary sources (such as chips,
shavings or sawdust), with secondary sources generally being more cost-effective compared to primary sources.
Other costs of sales in the Pellet Production segment comprise costs of transport and other costs related to the
production process.

**_Impairment losses on trade receivables_**

Provisions for impairment of trade receivables are measured at an amount equal to the lifetime expected
credit loss. Impairment losses on trade receivables are now disclosed separately on the face of the income
statement (they were previously included within operational and administrative expenses). Application of IFRS 9
has not had a material impact on the value of trade receivable impairment losses.

102


-----

**_Operating and administrative expenses_**

Operating and administrative expenses primarily consist of staff costs (such as wages and salaries, social
security costs, other pension costs and share based payments) and repairs and maintenance expenditure on
property, plant and equipment.

**_Adjusted EBITDA_**

Adjusted EBITDA represents profit/loss for the year before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and
certain material items that do not reflect the underlying trading performance of the business. See “Presentation of
_Financial Information and Other Information—Non-IFRS Financial Measures” for more information and an_
explanation of differences in the definition of Adjusted EBITDA across financial periods.

**_Depreciation and amortisation_**

Depreciation represents the systematic allocation of the cost of a tangible asset, or other amount substituted
for cost, less its residual value, over its useful life. Amortisation represents the systematic allocation of the cost
of an intangible asset, or other amount substituted for cost, less its residual value, over its useful life.

**_Unrealised gains or losses on derivative contracts_**

For the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2017 (prior to restatement), unrealised gains or losses on
derivative contracts represents changes in fair value of derivative contracts at the relevant balance sheet date, to
the extent the derivatives contracts do not qualify for the own use exemption or as effective hedges in accordance
with IFRS. For the years ended 31 December 2017 (restated) and 2018, we have re-presented our income
statement to include unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts in the line item in the income statement
to which they relate (revenue or cost of sales, as applicable), instead of in a separate line item below gross profit.
The fair value of a derivative contract is generally the difference between the price we have secured and the price
we could achieve in the market at the time.

Derivative contracts qualify for the own use exemption if they are contracts for the delivery of physical
commodities entered into and held for our own purchase, sale or usage requirements (e.g., derivative contracts
for physical coal or sustainable biomass). Derivative contracts that qualify for the own use exemption are not
accounted for using the fair value and therefore not included in unrealised gains or losses on derivative contracts.
In addition, changes in the fair value of derivative contracts that qualify as effective hedges under relevant IFRS
standards are accounted for in the hedge reserve and not in unrealised gains or losses on derivative contracts.

We adopted IFRS 9 to replace IAS 39 with effect from 1 January 2018. The adoption of this standard has
not had a significant impact on the classification and measurement of our financial assets or financial liabilities.
Following adoption, we implemented a policy to designate the fair value movements relating to forward basis
points and the time value of money of options as a “cost of hedging” and recognise these movements as a
component of other comprehensive income. See “—Significant Factors Affecting Comparability of Financial
_Information—Application of IFRS 9 and Re-presentation of our Income Statement”._

**_Interest payable and similar charges_**

Interest payable and similar charges reflect expenses incurred in managing our debt structure (such as
interest payable on our bank loans) as well as the unwinding of discount on provisions for the reinstatement of
our sites at the end of their useful lives, amortisation of deferred finance costs, net interest charges on our defined
benefit pension scheme obligations and other financing charges. The unwinding of discount on provisions for the
reinstatement of our sites at the end of their useful lives relates to the provisions we are making for the estimated
decommissioning costs at the end of the useful life of our Drax Power Station assets. The amount provided for
represents the present fair value of these obligations (using a risk-free pre-tax discount rate). The unwinding of
such discount is included in interest payable and similar charges.

**_Interest receivable_**

Interest receivable represents income generated through the use of short-term cash surpluses, for example
through investments in money market funds.

**_Foreign exchange gains and losses_**

Foreign exchange gains and losses arise on the retranslation of non-derivative balances and investments
denominated in foreign currencies to prevailing rates at the balance sheet date.

103


-----

**_Tax_**

The total tax charge includes both current and deferred tax. Current tax is the estimated amount payable on
the taxable profits of the relevant year (which is adjusted for items upon which we are not required to pay tax or,
in some cases, for items which are not allowable for tax purposes and therefore on which we are required to pay
additional tax). Deferred tax is an accounting adjustment which reflects whether more or less tax is expected to
arise in the future due to differences between the accounting and tax rules. The tax charge reflects the estimated
effective tax rate on profit before tax for the relevant year and the movement in the deferred tax charge in that
year, so far as it relates to items recognised in the income statement.

(1) For the years ended 31 December 2017 (restated) and 2018, our revenue and cost of sales includes certain remeasurements on
derivative contracts which cannot be designated as hedging instruments under IFRS which comprise gains or losses on derivative
contracts to the extent that those contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, or hedge accounting is not effective, and those gains or
losses are either (i) unrealised and relate to the delivery of commodity contracts in future periods, or (ii) are realised in relation to the
delivery of commodity contracts in the current period. The effect of excluding certain remeasurements from results of operations is to
reflect commodity sales and purchases at contracted prices—i.e. at the all-in-hedged amount paid or received in respect of the delivery
of the commodity in question. For the year ended 31 December 2016, unrealised gains/(losses) on derivative contracts are included in a
single line item below gross profit instead of in the line item to which they relate (revenue or cost of sales, as applicable).

(2) We define Adjusted EBITDA as profit/loss for the year before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and certain material items that do
not reflect the underlying trading performance of the business. Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended 31 December 2017 (both as
restated and prior to restatement) and 2018 does not exclude the receipt of £8.0 million and £16.9 million of insurance proceeds
primarily recognised within cost of sales, respectively, in respect of insurance claims, including claims for loss of generation from our
biomass units from 2016 through 2018. See “Presentation of Financial Information and Other Information—Non-IFRS Financial
_Measures” for more information. For a reconciliation from profit/loss for the year to Adjusted EBITDA, please see “—Key_
_Performance Indicators”._

(3) For the year ended 31 December 2018, represents a credit relating to contingent consideration in connection with our OCGT projects.
For the year ended 31 December 2017, represents unrealised losses on the equity investment in Aggregated Micro Power Holdings Plc
(£0.2 million) as well as a charge relating to contingent consideration payable in connection with our OCGT projects (£0.2 million).

(4) For the year ended 31 December 2018, represents costs associated with the acquisition and integration of DGEL into the Group (£21.0
million), closure of our Atlanta office to relocate the US head office to Monroe, Louisiana (£3.6 million) and certain restructuring costs

104


-----

in our B2B business (£3.0 million). For the year ended 31 December 2017, represents the costs associated with the acquisition and
integration of Opus into the Group. In the years 2016 and 2017, this line item was previously defined as “Acquisition-related costs”.

(5) Beginning in 2018, we include the cost of debt restructure, which comprises costs associated with the refinancing of our debt, within
interest payable and other similar charges. The years ended 31 December 2016 and 2017 have been re-presented to conform to this
presentation. Cost of debt restructure was £nil, £24.2 million and £7.2 million in the years ended 31 December 2016, 2017 and 2018,
respectively.

Beginning in 2017, we separated foreign exchange gains and losses from interest payable and similar charges. The year ended
31 December 2016 has been re-presented to conform to this presentation, consistent with Note 2.5 to the 2017 Drax Group Audited
Financial Statements.

(1) Comprised of £1,994.9 million and £1,686.2 million in external sales and £1,336.7 million and £1,033.4 million in inter-segment sales,
in each case, for the year ended 31 December 2018 and 2017, respectively.

(2) Comprised entirely of inter-segment sales.

_Revenue_

Our total revenue after intra-group eliminations increased by £544.7 million, or 14.8 per cent., from
£3,684.3 million in 2017 to £4,229.0 million in 2018. This increase was primarily due to higher revenues from
our Power Generation segment attributable, in part, to increased ROC sales and higher revenues from our B2B
Energy Supply segment attributable, in part, to the full year impact of Opus, which was acquired in February
2017. Where we choose to sell ROCs to accelerate cash flows, we may choose to purchase ROCs at a later date
to meet our obligation, leading to an offsetting charge in cost of sales. At 31 December 2018, following these
actions there was a similar value in revenue and cost of sales for ROC sales and purchases.

Adjusted Revenue (which excludes the impact of certain remeasurements on derivative contracts which
cannot be designated as hedging instruments under IFRS) increased by £552.1 million, or 15.0 per cent., from
£3,685.2 million in 2017 for £4,237.3 million in 2018.

_Power Generation revenue_

Revenue from the Power Generation segment (including inter-segment sales) increased by £612.0 million,
or 22.5 per cent., from £2,719.6 million in 2017 to £3,331.6 million for 2018 principally reflecting increased
ROC sales and an increase in CfD income due to increased unit availability in 2018. ROC sales of £664.5 million
in 2018 (2017: £367.8 million) increased significantly in the year as a result of a combination of the increase in
market prices and actions taken to accelerate the timing of cash flows from ROCs. Where we choose to sell
ROCs to accelerate cash flows, we may choose to purchase ROCs at a later date to meet our obligation, leading
to an offsetting charge in cost of sales. At 31 December 2018, following these actions there was a similar value in
revenue and cost of sales for ROC sales and purchases.

These positive trends were partially offset by decreased revenues from Ancillary Services (£18.8 million in
2018 compared to £30.7 million in 2017), primarily due to a specific ancillary services contract in 2016-2017
which did not extend into 2018. Electricity output from the Power Generation segment of 18.3 TWh in 2018 was
lower than 20.0 TWh in 2017 following unplanned outages during the first quarter.

-----

_B2B Energy Supply revenue_

Revenue from the B2B Energy Supply segment increased by £243.4 million, or 12.2 per cent., from
£1,999.0 million in 2017 to £2,242.4 million in 2018. There were no inter-segment sales in the B2B Energy
Supply segment in 2017 and 2018. The increase in B2B Energy Supply segment revenues was mainly due to
strong customer meter retention performance and the benefit from an additional month of revenue from Opus,
which was acquired in February 2017.

_Pellet Production revenue_

Revenue from the Pellet Production segment (which are all inter-segment sales) increased by £78.0 million,
or 57.5 per cent., from £135.7 million in 2017 to £213.7 million in 2018, reflecting increased production at each
of our US wood pellet manufacturing facilities, particularly at our LaSalle facility, which we acquired in 2017,
and which reached full production in 2018. During 2018, the Pellet Production segment produced approximately
1,351,000 tonnes of wood pellets compared to approximately 822,000 tonnes produced in 2017 and shipped
approximately 1,582,000 tonnes of wood pellets (aggregating the production from our Pellet Production segment
with third-party volumes shipped by us) compared to approximately 944,000 tonnes shipped in 2017.

The Pellet Production segment sells wood pellets to the Power Generation segment under fixed-price,
long-term intra-group supply contracts.

_Intra-group elimination_

Intra-group eliminations increased by £381.3.0 million, or 32.6 per cent., from £1,169.1 million in 2017 to
£1,550.4 million in 2018. Intra-group eliminations related to electricity, gas and ROC sales from the Power
Generation segment to the B2B Energy Supply segment increased by £303.3 million, or 29.3 per cent., from
£1,033.4 million in 2017 to £1,336.7 million for 2018. The B2B Energy Supply business sources its electricity
and gas mostly from the Power Generation business, with the increase reflecting the overall increase in B2B
Energy Supply sales and an increased proportion of Opus Energy purchases being sourced intra-group. Intragroup eliminations related to sales of wood pellets from the Pellet Production segment to the Power Generation
segment increased by £78 million, or 57.5 per cent., from £135.7 million in 2017 to £213.7 million for 2018 due
to higher wood pellet sales volumes reflecting the full commissioning of our LaSalle facility and expanded
production at our Amite and Morehouse wood pellet manufacturing facilities.

_Cost of sales_

Cost of sales increased by £273.4 million, or 8.2 per cent., from £3,316.2 million in 2017 to
£3,589.6 million in 2018. Adjusted Cost of Sales (which excludes the impact of certain remeasurements on
derivative contracts which cannot be designated as hedging instruments under IFRS) increased by
£496.1 million, or 15.8 per cent., from £3,140.2 million in 2017 to £3,636.3 million in 2018.

_Power Generation segment_

Cost of sales in the Power Generation segment increased by £391.7 million, or 15.7 per cent., from
£2,497.2 million in 2017 to £2,888.9 million in 2018. Excluding the impact of certain remeasurements on
derivative contracts which cannot be designated as hedging instruments under IFRS, cost of sales in the power
generation segment increased by £614.4 million, or 26.5 per cent., from £2,321.2 million in 2017 to
£2,935.6 million in 2018. This increase was primarily due to our substantial increase in ROC sales in 2018.
Where we choose to sell ROCs to accelerate cash flows, we may choose to purchase ROCs at a later date to meet
our obligation, leading to an offsetting charge in cost of sales. Fuel costs increased by £357.2 million, or 29.3 per
cent., from £1,356.8 million in 2017 to £1,714.0 million in 2018, primarily reflecting an increase in biomass
generation and an increase in purchases of ROCs made to offset increased sales of ROCs in order to accelerate
cash flows.

Grid charges were £58.4 million in 2018 compared to £62.9 million in 2017.

The volume of electricity purchases in the Power Generation segment, and as a result, the costs associated
therewith, increased from £891.2 million in 2017 to £1,051.2 million in 2018, primarily as a result of increased
purchases to buy back sold electricity following the unplanned outages in the first quarter of 2018.

_B2B Energy Supply segment_

Cost of sales in the B2B Energy Supply segment increased by £217.4 million, or 11.6 per cent., from
£1,881.6 million in 2017 to £2,099.0 million in 2018, respectively, primarily due to the effect of an additional

106


-----

month of costs in 2018 compared to 2017 respect of Opus, which we acquired in February 2017. These cost of
sales corresponded to gross profit margins of 5.9 per cent. and 6.4 per cent. for 2017 and 2018, respectively. The
increase in gross profit margin is primarily due to a focus on higher value contracts with larger customers. Higher
electricity sales as well as an increase in gas costs following the severe weather front in the first quarter resulted
in the cost of electricity and gas purchases increasing from £883.7 million in 2017 to £952.2 million in 2018. The
B2B Energy Supply segment purchases a significant proportion of its expected electricity and gas needs under
long- or medium-term supply agreements at fixed prices and the remainder under short-term arrangements.
Increasing wholesale electricity prices therefore do not immediately translate into a corresponding increase in the
cost of electricity purchases for the B2B Energy Supply segment or vice-versa.

Third-party costs, such as grid charges (including distribution, transmission and system balancing costs)
were £459.7 million in 2018 compared to £435.8 million in 2017. The costs of meeting Haven’s and Opus’
obligations under the various renewable energy subsidies schemes (e.g., the RO Scheme and SS-FiT) increased
and represented 51 per cent. of the B2B Energy Supply Segment’s revenue in 2018 compared to 50 per cent. in
2017.

_Pellet Production segment_

Cost of sales in the Pellet Production segment increased by £51.9 million, or 53.7 per cent., from
£96.7 million in 2017 to £148.6 million in 2018 reflecting the full commissioning of our LaSalle facility in 2018
and increased production volumes at our Amite and Morehouse wood pellet manufacturing facilities. Raw fibre
procurement comprised the largest share of these costs and we continued the process of controlling these costs
through a combination of measures, including greater utilisation of lower-cost residues.

_Operating and administrative expenses_

Operating and administrative expenses increased by £22.6 million, or 7.6 per cent., from £297.4 million in
2017 to £320 million in 2018. In the Power Generation segment, operating and administrative expenses increased
by £2.7 million, or 1.7 per cent., from £160.9 million in 2017 to £163.6 million in 2018 as a result of a high
volume of repair and maintenance work, including a major planned outage on one of our coal units and
unplanned outage costs on a biomass unit beginning in December 2017. These were partially offset by deferral of
a major planned outage on our fourth biomass unit until summer 2019 and by cost savings and efficiency
initiatives, including the implementation of lean management techniques. Operating and administrative expenses
in the B2B Energy Supply segment increased from £88.0 million in 2017 to £115.2 million in 2018, primarily
due to the contribution of a full year of costs in Opus. In the Pellet Production segment, operating and
administrative expenses increased from £33.5 million in 2017 to £44.3 million in 2018 reflecting increased
production volume. Central operating and administrative expenses attributable to the Drax Group amounted to
£28.3 million in 2018 compared to £33.7 million in 2017. The decrease reflects various cost saving and
efficiency initiatives.

_Impairment losses on financial assets_

Impairment losses on financial assets increased by £12.7 million, or 67.9 per cent., from £18.7 million in
2017 to £31.4 million in 2018 reflecting an increase in bad debt charges experienced by the B2B Energy Supply
segment primarily due to the challenging market for many of our customers.

_Adjusted EBITDA_

The following table shows our Adjusted EBITDA and a breakdown of the Adjusted EBITDA for our Power
Generation, B2B Energy Supply and Pellet Production segments for the years ended 31 December 2017 and
2018, respectively.

**Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **228.9** **249.6**

_Adjusted EBITDA_

Our Adjusted EBITDA increased by £20.7 million, or 9.0 per cent., from £228.9 million in 2017 to
£249.6 million in 2018, primarily reflecting growth in our Pellet Production business and a reduction in
centralised costs.

_Power Generation Adjusted EBITDA_

Adjusted EBITDA for the Power Generation segment decreased by £5.1 million, or 2.1 per cent., from
£237.5 million in 2017 to £232.4 million in 2018, reflecting the impact of unplanned biomass outages in early
2018, which contributed to a high volume of repair and maintenance work and temporarily restricted renewable
electricity output, as well as the suspension of the Capacity Market payments in the fourth quarter of 2018. This
was partially offset by the flexible and responsive operation of our coal generating units and increased renewable
generation resulting from the conversion of a fourth unit to biomass.

_B2B Energy Supply Adjusted EBITDA_

Adjusted EBITDA for the B2B Energy Supply segment decreased by £1.2 million, or 4.1 per cent., from
£29.4 million in 2017 to £28.2 million in 2018, due to a challenging market for customers and competitors, as
well as an increase in the cost of meeting our Renewable Obligation during the year due to the impact of RO
mutualisation, caused by the failure of several market participants which resulted in a larger proportion of the
industry’s RO costs being shared by the remaining suppliers. This decrease was partially offset by growth in
market share and margin per meter.

_Pellet Production Adjusted EBITDA_

Adjusted EBITDA for the Pellet Production segment increased by £15.3 million, or 278.2 per cent., from
£5.5 million in 2017 to £20.8 million in 2018, reflecting the increased output and reduced cost per pellet.

_Depreciation and amortisation_

Depreciation and amortisation charges increased by £7.5 million, or 4.5 per cent., from £166.3 million in
2017 to £173.8 million in 2018, mainly reflecting charges for the LaSalle pellet production facility which was
commissioned and reached full production in 2018.

_Acquisition and restructuring costs_

Acquisition and restructuring costs increased by £19.9 million, or 255.1 per cent., from £7.8 million in 2017
to £27.7 million in 2018, primarily due to costs of £21 million incurred in connection with the DGEL
Acquisition and £4 million in relation to the relocation of our US head office from Atlanta, Georgia to Monroe,
Louisiana, in close proximity to the pellet production and port facilities.

_Operating profit/loss_

Operating profit changed from a loss of £137.9 million in 2017 to a profit of £59.9 million in 2018, a change
of £197.8 million. This change is primarily due to the movement in gains and losses on derivative contracts that
do not qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS. Adjusted Operating Profit (which excludes the impact of
exceptional items and certain remeasurements on derivative contracts that cannot be designated as hedging
instruments under IFRS) increased by £29.2 million, or 62 per cent., from £46.8 million in 2017 to £76.0 million
in 2018, primarily reflecting an increase in Adjusted EBITDA.

_Interest payable and similar charges_

Interest payable and similar charges decreased by £8.1 million, or 14.5 per cent., from £55.7 million in 2017
to £47.6 million in 2018. This decrease is primarily due to the incurrence in 2017 of £24 in million early
repayment charges and accelerated amortisation of deferred finance costs associated with the refinancing of the
2017 Bridge Facility compared to £7 million of refinancing costs and acceleration of deferred financing costs in
2018 related to repayment of the £200 million aggregate principal amount of 2022 Floating Rate Notes. Adjusted
Interest payable and similar charges (which excludes the impact of debt restructuring costs associated with the
refinancing of the Group’s debt) increased by £8.9 million, or 28.3 per cent., from £31.5 million in 2017 to
£40.4 million in 2018, largely reflecting a full year’s interest charge on the debt incurred in relation to the
acquisition of Opus Energy in February 2017 and other costs associated with working capital management.

_Interest receivable_

Interest receivable increased by £1.0 million from £0.2 million in 2017 to £1.2 million in 2018.

_Foreign exchange gains and losses_

Foreign exchange gains and losses increased by £10.9 million from a loss of £10.6 million in 2017 to a gain
of £0.3 million in 2018, due to the non-cash effect of the revaluation of certain assets that are denominated in
currencies other than pounds sterling (including intercompany loans denominated in US dollars). The value of
these assets measured in pounds sterling increased during 2018 as a result of the pound sterling’s depreciation
against other major currencies, including the US dollar.

_Tax_

The total tax credit decreased by £29.7 million, or 82.3 per cent., from a tax credit of £36.1 million in 2017
to a tax credit of £6.4 million in 2018, primarily as a result of an increase in pre-tax profit of £217.8 million from
a loss of £204.0 million in 2017 to a profit of £13.8 million in 2018, reflecting the factors discussed above.
Adjusted Total Tax Credit/Charge (which excludes the tax impact of exceptional items and certain
remeasurements on derivative contracts which are not designated as hedging instruments under IFRS) changed
by £6.0 million from a charge of £2.2 million in 2017 to a credit of £4.8 million in 2018. The £2.2 million charge
in 2017 is primarily due to HMRC agreeing a claim arising from a patent relating to biomass which enables the
Group to pay corporate taxes at a lower rate (10 per cent.) on profits which arise from the use of innovation on an
ongoing basis. A benefit of £8.1 million was recognised during 2018 which drives a lower effective tax rate than
the standard corporation tax rate in the UK. The charge in 2017 includes the effects of a £15.7 million deferred
tax charge arising from the reduction in US Federal tax rates to 21 per cent. from 1 January 2018, net of a credit
of £10.3 million in relation to the patent box claim for years 2013 to 2016.

Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) during 2018 were £1.0 million compared to £14.0 million for 2017.

_Profit for the year_

Profit for the year increased by £188.1 million from a loss of £167.9 million in 2017 to a profit of
£20.2 million in 2018, mainly reflecting the factors discussed above.

(1) Comprised of £1,686.2 million and £1,622.7 million in external sales and £1,033.4 million and £868.2 million in inter-segment sales, in
each case, for the year ended 31 December 2017 and 2016, respectively.

(2) Comprised of £0.7 million in external sales for the year ended 31 December 2016. All revenue for the year ended 31 December 2017
was comprised entirely of inter-segment sales.

_Revenue_

Our total revenue after intra-group eliminations increased by £735.4 million, or 24.9 per cent., from
£2,949.8 million in 2016 to £3,685.2 million in 2017. This increase was primarily due to higher revenues from
our Power Generation segment attributable, in part, to inclusion of a full year of support under the CfD
mechanism for our third biomass-fired generation unit and higher revenues from our B2B Energy Supply
Segment attributable, in part, to the acquisition of Opus, which was completed on 10 February 2017.

_Power Generation revenue_

Revenue from the Power Generation segment (including inter-segment sales) increased by £228.7 million,
or 9.2 per cent., from £2,490.9 million in 2016 to £2,719.6 million in 2017 principally reflecting the effect of a
full year of support of our third biomass-fired generation unit by the CfD mechanism as well as slightly higher
electricity output. CfD payments in respect of this generation unit did not begin until December 2016, and
therefore CfD support had a comparatively small contribution to our results for the year ended 31 December
2016. Electricity output from the Power Generation segment of 20.0 TWh in 2017 was slightly higher than
19.6 TWh in 2016.

These positive trends were partially offset by decreased revenues from Ancillary Services (£47.3 million in
2016 compared to £30.7 million in 2017). ROC sales to third-parties were flat year-over-year, at £367.8 million
(2016: £366.7 million).

_B2B Energy Supply revenue_

Revenue from the B2B Energy Supply segment increased by £672.6 million, or 50.7 per cent., from
£1,326.4 million in 2016 to £1,999.0 million in 2017. There were no inter-segment sales in the B2B Energy
Supply segment in 2016 and 2017. The increase in B2B Energy Supply segment revenues was mainly due to the
contribution to revenue of £610.7 million from Opus following its acquisition on 10 February 2017, including,
for the first time, revenues from sales of gas, a key contributor to revenues over the winter period in 2017. Higher
average sales prices in the Haven Power business due to higher wholesale electricity prices had a positive impact
on revenue during 2017. The supply arrangements with many of the larger customers of the B2B Energy Supply
segment allow the customer flexibility to decide when to fix the price of their electricity or to purchase their
electricity at the prevailing market rates for the day or month ahead. Haven Power purchases the electricity to
fulfil the customer’s requirements at the same point in time at which the customer agrees to fix a price allowing
Haven Power to secure a fixed margin for these transactions. Therefore, while our revenue may fluctuate
depending on the wholesale electricity price, given the effective fixed margin of these flexible contracts this has a
limited impact on our profitability.

-----

_Pellet Production revenue_

Revenue from the Pellet Production segment (including inter-segment sales) increased by £62.1 million, or
84.4 per cent., from £73.6 million in 2016 to £135.7 million in 2017, reflecting increased production at our Amite
and Morehouse wood pellet manufacturing facilities as well as a small amount of production from our LaSalle
facility, which was acquired on 13 April 2017. During 2017, the Pellet Production segment produced
approximately 822,000 tonnes of wood pellets compared to approximately 607,000 tonnes produced in 2016 and
shipped approximately 944,000 tonnes of wood pellets compared to approximately 558,000 tonnes shipped in
2016.

The Pellet Production segment sells wood pellets to the Power Generation segment under fixed-price,
long-term intra-group supply contracts.

_Intra-group elimination_

Intra-group eliminations increased by £228.0 million, or 24.2 per cent., from £941.1 million in 2016 to
£1,169.1 million in 2017. Intra-group eliminations related to electricity, gas and ROC sales from the Power
Generation segment to the B2B Energy Supply segment increased by £165.2 million, or 19.0 per cent., from
£868.2 million in 2016 to £1,033.4 million in 2017 as a result of higher electricity and ROC sales to Haven
Power and Opus following the termination of Opus’ existing supply contracts with third party suppliers, further
reinforced by higher average realised sale prices for electricity. Intra-group eliminations related to sales of wood
pellets from the Pellet Production segment to the Power Generation segment increased by £62.8 million, or
86.1 per cent., from £72.9 million in 2016 to £135.7 million in 2017 due to higher wood pellet sales volumes
reflecting the expanded production at our Amite and Morehouse wood pellet manufacturing facilities and
commissioning production from LaSalle.

_Total cost of sales_

Total cost of sales increased by £566.7 million, or 22.0 per cent., from £2,573.5 million in 2016 to
£3,140.2 million in 2017.

_Power Generation segment_

Cost of sales in the Power Generation segment increased by £167.2 million, or 7.8 per cent., from
£2,153.9 million in 2016 to £2,321.1 million in 2017 primarily due to the decrease in ROCs awarded in 2017 as a
result of our third biomass-fired generation unit operating under the CfD mechanism post-conversion (which
does not generate ROCs), as anticipated ROCs are recognised as a reduction in our biomass fuel costs at the point
of generation until the relevant ROCs are received, as well as higher fuel costs. These effects were only partially
offset by slightly lower grid charges driven by higher generation volumes and lower costs of electricity
purchases. Fuel costs increased by £202.6 million, or 17.6 per cent., from £1,154.2 million in 2016 to
£1,356.8 million in 2017, primarily reflecting higher generation volumes and higher commodity prices, partially
driven by lower ROC generation as a result of our converted CfD-supported biomass-fired generation unit no
longer receiving ROCs. While commodity prices increased in 2017 relative to previous years, fuel costs did not
increase at corresponding rates as the Power Generation segment procures a substantial part of its fuel needs
under long-term supply fixed prices contracts. ROC generation continued to have a significant impact on fuel
costs as the expected benefit from ROCs earned from the biomass-fired generation units are initially recognised
as a reduction in the Power Generation segment’s biomass fuel costs and subsequently recognised as revenue
when the ROC is sold to a third-party.

Lower grid charges of £62.9 million in 2017 compared to £69.4 million in 2016 principally reflect reduced
transmission network use of system charges due to changes in methodology by the System Operator.

The volume of electricity purchases in the Power Generation segment, and as a result, the costs associated
therewith, decreased from £904.4 million in 2016 to £891.2 million in 2017, primarily as a result of reduced
system volatility in 2017 compared to 2016 leading to a corresponding reduction in the periods during which it
was most economic to buy electricity on the wholesale market to satisfy our delivery obligations than generate
directly.

_B2B Energy Supply segment_

Cost of sales in the B2B Energy Supply segment increased by £578.7 million, or 44.4 per cent., from
£1,302.9 million in 2016 to £1,881.6 million in 2017, respectively, primarily due to the contribution of Opus,

111


-----

which contributed £528 million to our costs of sales for 2017 following its acquisition on 10 February 2017, as
well as due to the rising cost of electricity purchases and other retail costs. These cost of sales corresponded to
gross profit margins of 1.8 per cent. and 5.9 per cent. for 2016 and 2017, respectively. The increase in gross
profit margin is primarily due to the higher gross margin achieved by Opus than our business prior to the Opus
Acquisition. Higher electricity sales as well as the inclusion for the first time of gas sales due to Opus resulted in
the cost of electricity and gas purchases increasing from £688.9 million in 2016 to £883.7 million in 2017. The
B2B Energy Supply segment purchases a significant proportion of its expected electricity and gas needs under
long- or medium-term supply agreements at fixed prices and the remainder under short-term arrangements.
Increasing wholesale electricity prices therefore do not immediately translate into a corresponding increase in the
cost of electricity purchases for the B2B Energy Supply segment or vice-versa.

Third-party costs, such as grid charges (including distribution, transmission and system balancing costs)
were £435.8 million in 2017 compared to £310.4 million in 2016. The costs of meeting Haven’s and Opus’
obligations under the various renewable energy subsidies schemes (e.g., RO and SS-FiT schemes) continued to
increase and represented 50 per cent. of the B2B Energy Supply Segment’s revenue in 2017 compared to 46 per
cent. in 2016.

_Pellet Production segment_

Cost of sales in the Pellet Production segment increased by £41.2 million, or 74.2 per cent., from
£55.5 million in 2016 to £96.7 million in 2017 reflecting the increased production volumes at our Amite and
Morehouse wood pellet manufacturing facilities following our investments to increase capacity as well as the
commissioned capacity at our LaSalle facility. Raw fibre procurement comprised the largest share of these costs
and we continued the process of controlling these costs through a combination of measures, including improved
forecasting of utilisation and increased purchases of more cost-effective feedstocks such as sawmill residues.

_Operating and administrative expenses_

Operating and administrative expenses increased by £79.8 million, or 33.8 per cent., from £236.3 million in
2016 to £316.1 million in 2017. In the Power Generation segment, operating and administrative expenses
decreased by £2.4 million, or 1.5 per cent., from £163.3 million in 2016 to £160.9 million in 2017 as a result of
cost savings and efficiency initiatives, including the implementation of lean management techniques, despite a
high volume of repair and maintenance work, including a major planned outage on one of our biomass units and
an unplanned outage in December 2017. Operating and administrative expenses in the B2B Energy Supply
segment increased significantly to £88.0 million in 2017 compared to £27.8 million in 2016, primarily due to the
contribution of Opus. In the Pellet Production segment, operating and administrative expenses increased to
£33.5 million in 2017 from £24.4 million in 2016 reflecting the increased production volumes at Amite and
Morehouse wood pellet manufacturing facilities following our investments to increase capacity. Central
operating and administrative expenses attributable to the Drax Group amounted to £33.7 million in 2017
compared to £20.9 million in 2016. The increase reflects investment in strategy, innovation and development
activities, only partially offset by cost saving and efficiency initiatives.

_Adjusted EBITDA_

The following table shows our Adjusted EBITDA and a breakdown of the Adjusted EBITDA for our Power
Generation, B2B Energy Supply and Pellet Production segments for the years ended 31 December 2016 and
2017, respectively.

-----

_Adjusted EBITDA_

Our Adjusted EBITDA increased by £88.9 million, or 63.5 per cent., from £140.0 million in 2016 to
£228.9 million in 2017, primarily due to increased revenues as a result of the contribution from Opus of
£28.9 million in Adjusted EBITDA for 2017 following its acquisition on 10 February 2017 and inclusion of a full
year of support of our third biomass-fired generation unit by the CfD mechanism, partially offset by higher costs
of sales and administrative and operating costs. The consolidation adjustment represents the elimination of
unrealised profit on intra-group stock.

_Power Generation Adjusted EBITDA_

Adjusted EBITDA for the Power Generation segment increased by £63.7 million, or 36.7 per cent., from
£173.8 million in 2016 to £237.5 million in 2017 reflecting the factors discussed above.

_B2B Energy Supply Adjusted EBITDA_

Adjusted EBITDA for the B2B Energy Supply segment increased by £33.7 million from negative
£4.3 million in 2016 to £29.4 million in 2017 reflecting the factors discussed above. Opus contributed
£28.9 million to Adjusted EBITDA for 2017 following its acquisition on 10 February 2017.

_Pellet Production Adjusted EBITDA_

Adjusted EBITDA for the Pellet Production segment increased by £11.8 million from negative £6.3 million
in 2016 to £5.5 million in 2017 reflecting the factors discussed above.

_Depreciation and amortisation_

Depreciation and amortisation charges increased by £56.8 million, or 51.9 per cent., from £109.5 million in
2016 to £166.3 million in 2017, mainly reflecting the higher asset base as a result of the intangible assets
recognised on acquisition of Opus (£37.0 million) and acceleration of the depreciation of the coal specific assets
in Power Generation (£15.0 million).

_Unrealised (losses)/gains on derivative contracts_

Unrealised gains/losses on derivative contracts changed from a gain of £176.8 million in 2016 to a loss of
£156.1 million in 2017, a change of £332.9 million, or 188.3 per cent. This change principally relates to losses
under forward currency purchase contracts and reflects the change in the fair value of our derivative contracts as
the pound sterling strengthened substantially against the US dollar during 2017, the currency in which the
majority of our fuel purchases are denominated, largely reversing the losses in the value of the pound sterling
relative to the US dollar sustained in 2016 that resulted, in part, from the UK’s referendum on withdrawing from
the European Union. These losses were partially offset by mark-to-market gains as a result of fair value
movements on our derivative contracts relating to commodities which increased as a result of the relatively lower
pressure on commodity prices compared to 2016.

_Operating profit/loss_

Despite the increase in EBITDA described above, operating profit changed from a profit of £203.5 million
in 2016 to a loss of £117.1 million in 2017, a change of £320.6 million, or 157.5 per cent. This change is
primarily due to the change from unrealised gains to unrealised losses on derivative contracts discussed above.

_Cost of debt restructure_

Cost of debt restructure was £24.2 million in 2017, representing acceleration of deferred financing costs and
the one-off cost of early repayment charges for loans outstanding, in each case at the time of our refinancing of
our debt in May 2017.

_Interest payable and similar charges_

Interest payable and similar charges increased by £2.5 million, or 8.6 per cent., from £29.0 million in 2016
to £31.5 million in 2017. This increase primarily reflects interest costs driven by a higher quantum of debt than
the previous year as a result of the Opus Acquisition. Interest payable on bank borrowings increased significantly
to £25.6 million in 2017 (2016: £19.4 million).

113


-----

_Interest receivable_

Interest receivable decreased by £0.4 million from £0.6 million in 2016 to £0.2 million in 2017, primarily as
a result of fewer short-term cash surpluses available to make interest-generating investments.

_Foreign exchange gains and losses_

Foreign exchange gains and losses changed by £32.6 million from a gain of £22.0 million in 2016 to a loss
of £10.6 million in 2017, due to the non-cash effect of the revaluation of certain assets that are denominated in
currencies other than pounds sterling (including intercompany loans denominated in US dollars). The value of
these assets measured in pounds sterling decreased during 2017 as a result of the pound sterling’s appreciation
against other major currencies, including the US dollar.

_Tax_

Our total tax charge decreased by £35.3 million from a tax charge of £3.2 million in 2016 to a tax credit of
£32.1 million in 2017, primarily as a result of a loss before tax in 2017 compared to a taxable profit before tax in
2016. In addition, in 2017, we received notification of a patent box claim with respect to the biomass generation
business for which we obtained a tax credit of £10.3 million. This tax credit was more than offset by the one-off
non-cash deferred tax charge (£16 million) (arising from the reduction in US federal tax rates to 21 per cent. from
1 January 2018) held in respect of built up start-up losses for the US Pellet Production businesses. As we do not
expect to pay taxes in the near term in the US, it is not expected to have an impact on cash taxes payable by those
of our businesses that are subject to US taxation.

Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) during 2017 were £14.0 million compared to £1.7 million for 2016.

_Profit for the year_

Profit for the year decreased by £345.0 million from £193.9 million in 2016 to a loss of £151.1 million in
2017, mainly reflecting the factors discussed above under “—Operating Profit”.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

We are financed through a combination of cash generated from operations, drawings under the Revolving
Credit Facility and proceeds of arrangements in respect of receivables and from financing arrangements (which,
following the issuance of the New Notes and the use of proceeds therefrom as described under “Use of
_Proceeds”, will consist of the Notes, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes, the 2022 Fixed Rate Notes, the 2018 Bridge_
Facility and the Term Loan). See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements”. Liquidity, including shortterm working capital requirements, is primarily financed through arrangements in respect of receivables together
with available cash resources. For the year ended 31 December 2018, the net cash inflow derived from the Haven
Power MRTSA was £24 million.

On 31 December 2018, we acquired DGEL, a UK power generation business which owns and operates a
portfolio of hydro, pumped storage and gas-fired power generation assets, for a net consideration of £687 million
after customary net debt and working capital adjustments. We paid the initial consideration due to the vendor on
2 January 2019 using a combination of £550 million drawn under the 2018 Bridge Facility and £137 million of
cash reserves. Accordingly, no profit or loss has been recognised in respect of DGEL in 2018, and neither the
drawing under the 2018 Bridge Facility nor the reduction in cash in respect of the consideration paid are reflected
in our consolidated net debt as at 31 December 2018. The assets and liabilities acquired have been included in
our consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2018. Prior to its acquisition by us, DGEL was historically
funded by a combination of borrowings from other companies controlled by its former parent, Iberdrola, S.A.,
and through cash generated from operations.

**_Cash Generated from Operations_**

Cash generated from operations was £336.4 million in 2018 compared to £375.7 million in 2017, primarily
reflecting a reduction in the amount of cash released from working capital in 2018, partially offset by an increase
in Adjusted EBITDA. Cash released from working capital, principally reflected an increase in ROC assets held
on the balance sheet as compared to 2017.

Cash generated from operations was £375.7 million in 2017 compared to £213.1 million in 2016, primarily
reflecting cash inflows arising from the improvement in EBITDA, supported by an improved working capital
profile arising from our CfD which is more cash efficient resulting in the reduction of ROCs held on balance
sheet, along with increased usage of the Haven Power MRTSA.

_Changes in working capital (other than Power Generation segment carbon assets and ROC assets)_

Our working capital mainly comprises fuel inventories (primarily biomass and coal) in the Power
Generation segment and feedstock and wood pellet inventories in the Pellet Production segment. In our B2B
Energy Supply segment, working capital mainly comprises trade payables related to the obligation to procure a
sufficient number of ROCs and trade receivables against customers.

Net cash inflow from changes in working capital (other than Power Generation segment carbon assets and
ROC assets) was £186.5 million in 2018 compared to £53.6 million in 2017. Inventories decreased by
£52.5 million in 2018 compared to a decrease of £15.4 million in 2017. Biomass inventory levels in 2018 were
lower than in 2017 due to the combination of a fire in the biomass rail unloading system at Drax Power Station in
2017 which diminished our ability to receive shipments of biomass in early 2018, followed by increased
generation as a result of the completion of the conversion of a fourth unit from coal to biomass. Coal inventories
increased in 2018 reflecting a combination of opportunistic purchases of low-price cargoes, as well as lower than
expected generation from coal. Receivables increased by £15.4 million in 2018 (2017: decrease of £60.6 million),
driven by an increase in generation sales in the final months of the year compared to the previous year. Payables
increased by £149.4 million in 2018 (2017: decrease by £22.4 million) broadly in line with the increased sales
profile and the use of new purchasing facilities to extend the payment period for certain of our payables.

Net cash inflow from changes in working capital (other than Power Generation segment carbon assets and
ROC assets) was £53.6 million in 2017 compared to £38.8 million in 2016. Inventories decreased by

115


-----

£15.4 million in 2017 compared to an increase of £63.5 million in 2016. Biomass inventory levels in 2017 were
higher than in 2016 due to the timing of outages, with a reduction in coal inventories in 2017 reflecting the
decreasing use of our coal-fired generation units. Receivables decreased by £60.6 million in 2017 (2016:
decrease of £28.6 million), driven by a reduced level of generation sales in December compared to the previous
year. Payables decreased by £22.4 million in 2017 (2016: increase by £73.7 million) broadly in line with the
decreased sales profile.

_Increase/decrease in carbon assets_

Carbon assets are emissions allowances purchased and held by us to be used in the relevant year pursuant to
EU ETS.

Carbon assets increased by £3.7 million in 2018 compared to a decrease by £0.6 million in 2017 and a
decrease by £11.1 million in 2016. We purchase carbon assets in advance based on our estimated generation from
coal during each year. Increases and decreases in carbon assets therefore mainly reflect lower or higher
generation from coal than originally estimated. In addition, the market for carbon assets is most liquid towards
the end of each calendar year and we purchase or sell significant amounts of carbon assets towards the end of the
calendar year, making the amount of carbon assets held on balance sheet at year end susceptible to volatility.

_Increase/decrease in ROC_

The value of ROCs created in the Power Generation segment is held on the balance sheet until these assets
are sold to a third-party, at which time ROCs are recognised as revenue. The timing of such sale is driven by RO
deadlines and commercial considerations, resulting in a time lag between the time at which the ROCs are booked
in the balance sheet and the time at which the purchase price for these assets is realised. We have facilities in
place to accelerate cash flows from invoices issued in relation to ROC sales and also sell ROCs to accelerate cash
flows, purchasing ROCs at a later date to meet our regulatory requirements.

ROC assets increased by £71.2 million in 2018 compared to a decrease of £112.1 million in 2017. The
increase in ROC assets in 2018 principally reflects the conversion of a fourth unit from coal to biomass and the
improvement in biomass generation output in the final quarter of 2018 compared to 2017.

ROC assets decreased by £112.1 million in 2017 compared to a decrease of £12.5 million in 2016. The
decrease in ROC assets in 2017 principally reflects the approval of the CfD contract for our third biomass-fired
generation unit, which was previously supported by the ROC regime pre-conversion, as well as an increase in the
number of ROCs sold in 2017 compared to 2016. As a result of this conversion, the number of ROCs earned is
lower compared to 2016 with respect to the third biomass unit, with a corresponding benefit on our cash flow due
to payments under the CfD contract.

**_Cash Flows from Investing Activities_**

Net cash used in investing activities was £133.5 million in 2018 compared to £554.5 million in 2017 and
primarily comprised maintenance capital expenditure, investment to convert our fourth generation unit from coal
to biomass, and costs in respect of commissioning our LaSalle wood pellet manufacturing facility and the
construction of a nearby rail spur. The decrease compared to 2017 primarily reflects the acquisition of Opus in
February 2017 in addition to the large number of capital projects and asset acquisitions carried out in 2017,
including our purchase of the LaSalle facility, in addition to investments to expand capacity at two of our
biomass pellet manufacturing facilities and to bring production at our LaSalle facility up to capacity. Net cash
used in investing activities for 2018 does not include the payment of consideration in respect of the DGEL
Acquisition, which was made on 2 January 2019. Capital expenditure for maintenance was relatively low in
2018, despite a busy maintenance schedule due to unplanned outages on our biomass units in the first quarter of
2018.

Net cash used in investing activities was £554.5 million in 2017 compared to £93.2 million in 2016. The
increase compared to 2016 primarily reflects our investments to acquire Opus in February 2017 as well as our
purchase of the LaSalle facility, in addition to investments to expand capacity at two of our biomass pellet
manufacturing facilities and to bring production at our LaSalle facility up to capacity, partially offset by lower
maintenance capital expenditure with respect to our remaining coal-fired generation units. Capital expenditure
for maintenance and repair was relatively flat in 2017 compared to 2016 despite the unplanned outage on one of
our biomass rail unloading facilities following a fire on a section of conveyor that resulted in a restriction on fuel
deliveries by rail and a corresponding restriction on the optimisation of generation across our biomass-fired units,
reflecting the reduced maintenance programme for the coal-fired generation units and the postponement to 2018
of a major planned outage for 2017.

**_Cash Flows from Financing Activities_**

Net cash absorbed by financing activities was £112.0 million in 2018 compared to net cash generated from
financing activities of £235.3 million in 2017, reflecting primarily the net effect of refinancing activity in each
period, the increase in dividends paid out to shareholders during 2018 compared to 2017 (from £21.6 million in
2017 to £52.5 million in 2018) and £47.1 million in share buy-backs during 2018 in connection with our
£50 million share buy-back programme, which was completed in January 2019. See “—Dividend Policy”. Net
cash absorbed by financing activities for 2018 does not include £550 million of drawings under the 2018 Bridge
Facility used to finance the DGEL Acquisition on 2 January 2019. Net cash generated from financing activities
was £235.3 million in 2017 compared to net cash absorbed by financing activities of £10.9 million in 2016,
reflecting primarily the drawing down of the 2017 Bridge Facility used to part-fund the acquisition of Opus in
February 2017 and our subsequent refinancing in May 2017.

**_Capital Expenditure_**

Our capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment amounted to £113.6 million, £164.6 million and
£95.7 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Capital expenditure to maintain operational performance
constituted £56.0 million, £69.4 million and £68.9 million of our capital expenditure in 2018, 2017 and 2016,
respectively. Our capital expenditure for 2016 included purchases of software assets, however, beginning in
2017, we no longer account for purchases of software as property, plant and equipment, classifying software as
intangible assets instead. Including the impact of purchases of software assets, our total capital expenditure for
2018 and 2017 would have been £142.5 million and £180.6 million, respectively.

Excluding the impact of acquisitions and related commissioning costs (in particular, in 2017, the purchase
of the LaSalle manufacturing facility, which was accounted for as an asset purchase and not the acquisition of a
business, and related commissioning costs which continued into 2018), our capital expenditure would have
amounted to £111.8 million (excluding £1.8 million of commissioning costs in relation to the LaSalle
manufacturing facility which were capitalised in 2018), £116.8 million and £95.7 million in 2018, 2017 and
2016, respectively.

For the year ending 31 December 2019, we expect capital expenditure (including the impact of purchases of
software assets) to be between £170 million and £190 million, consisting of an estimated £60 million of
maintenance capital expenditure in relation to Drax Power Station, additional capital expenditure of £30 million
to £35 million in relation to DGEL, an estimated £40 million of efficiency improvements, including a turbine
upgrade on our second biomass unit and an upgraded IT platform in our B2B Energy Supply segment and capital
expenditure incurred to ensure the B2B Energy Supply segment’s compliance with its obligations to provide
smart electricity meters to customers, an estimated further £35 million to £45 million for strategic capital
expenditure, including biomass self-supply capacity expansion and development of gas options through our
OCGT power plants and coal-to-gas conversion project at Drax Power Station and an estimated £5 million to £10
million of other general capital expenditure.

In the medium term, we expect that our capital expenditure will primarily depend on whether and when we
decide to develop our pipeline of gas generation projects. Our options range from the development of up to four
299MW rapid-response OCGT projects requiring £80 million to £90 million spread over three to four years per
development, to projects to repower one or both of our coal-fired units at Drax Power Station to 1.8GW CCGT
units (with an initial estimated cost of approximately £600 million per unit, provided in the related planning
application for the projects, spread over a number of years), to an opportunity to develop our Damhead Creek II
site into a 1.8GW CCGT plant, with a broadly similar cost to repowering one of our coal units to gas. All projects
are in the early stages of development and, accordingly, actual costs may vary. Each of these projects would
require an appropriate level of support through the Capacity Market (if and when re-established) to provide a
baseline of expected revenue sufficient to justify a positive investment decision.

(1) The Senior Facilities provide for up to £350 million of senior secured borrowings, comprised of a £315 million committed
multicurrency revolving credit facility and a £35 million term loan facility. As at 31 December 2018, the Senior Facilities had been
utilised in respect of letters of credit with a total value of £31.8 million, and the index-linked term loan facility of £35 million was fully
drawn. The carrying value of the term loan at 31 December 2018 is £37.1 million which includes £2.1 million indexation.

(2) The Existing Notes are comprised of the 2022 Notes and the Initial Notes. The aggregate principal amount of 2022 Notes and Initial
Notes outstanding as of 31 December 2018 was £350.0 million and £235.3 million, respectively, the latter of which represents the
pound sterling equivalent of the $300 million aggregate amount of the Initial Notes calculated using a currency exchange rate of
$1.2751 to £1.00, which was the market rate on 31 December 2018, sourced from Reuters, used for the preparation of its balance sheet
contained in the 2018 Drax Group Audited Financial Statements. During 2018, the Group entered into a cross-currency interest rate
swap, fixing the sterling value of the principal repayments in respect of the Initial Notes. If US dollar balances relating to the Initial
Notes are translated at the hedged rate, rather than the rate prevailing at 31 December 2018, our net debt would have been reduced by
£22.0 million.

Commitments to purchase fuel reflect long-term forward purchase contracts with a variety of international
suppliers, primarily for the delivery of sustainable wood pellets for use in electricity production at Drax Power
Station over the period from 2019–2027. To the extent these contracts relate to the purchase of wood pellets or
coal from domestic sources, they are not reflected elsewhere in the Drax Group Audited Financial Statements
owing to application of the “own-use” exemption from recognition of the financial instruments concerned.

The above table does not include approximately £5 million in the aggregate in minimum lease payments
under non-cancellable operating leases attributable to DGEL at 31 December 2018.

**Contingent Assets and Liabilities**

On 15 November 2018 the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union found in favour of a
claim against the European Commission, annulling the Commission’s state aid approval of the UK Capacity
Market. This ruling imposed a standstill period on the Capacity Market, with payments under existing contracts
and future capacity auctions suspended indefinitely until re-approval. Following this ruling, we ceased to accrue
Capacity Market income in our Power Generation business. Any revenue up to 30 September 2018 was received,
but from this date no amounts have been recognised.

The Department for Business, Energy, Innovation and Skills (DBEIS) has indicated its intent, in a
consultation document dated 19 December 2018, to work with the European Commission to achieve a
reinstatement of the Capacity Market as soon as possible. Furthermore, DBEIS has indicated that, upon
reinstatement, it expects to make back payments to generators who have complied with their capacity agreements
during the standstill period. At the date of signing these accounts, we have complied with our capacity
obligations in full. However, reinstatement remains conditional upon EU state aid re-approval and accordingly at
the date of these accounts remains uncertain.

If the Capacity Market is reinstated and payments are backdated, we will receive income of £7 million in
respect of payments due to our Power Generation business which would become payable in respect of the year
ended 31 December 2018. Any backdated Capacity Market payments due to DGEL relating to the period
following the Capacity Market suspension but prior to the acquisition date (1 October to 31 December 2018) will
be passed directly to DGEL’s former parent.

Should 100 per cent. of the contracted Capacity Market payments for DGEL not be received in respect of
the period 1 January to 30 September 2019, a risk sharing mechanism may result in further payments being made
either to or from Drax in respect of the DGEL Acquisition in an amount up to £26 million. See “Summary—
_DGEL Acquisition”._

As at 31 December 2018, we had contingent liabilities in respect of letters of credit issued on behalf of
certain members of the Drax Group by a number of banks in an amount of £31.8 million (as at 31 December
2017: £35.7 million).

Certain members of the Drax Group also guarantee obligations in the form of surety bonds with a number of
insurers amounting to £63.7 million as at 31 December 2018 (2017: £41.3 million).

**Pensions**

We currently operate a defined benefit and four defined contribution pension schemes. The Power
Generation business operates a defined benefit scheme within the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme framework
under which participating members are entitled to a pension on retirement based on their final pensionable salary
(the “DPG ESPS”). This scheme has been closed to new members as from 1 January 2002. As part of the DGEL
Acquisition, employees with defined benefit pension rights were transferred to Drax. These employees continue
to participate in the ScottishPower pension scheme whilst we set up a new pension scheme (the “Drax 2019
**Scheme”) for these employees to transfer to, which will include assets and liabilities for past service benefits.**
The Drax Power Limited Plan, Haven Power Personal Pension Plan, Opus Energy Group Personal Pension Plan
and Drax Biomass Inc. 401(k) Plan are defined contribution schemes, which provide a retirement benefit that is
dependent upon actual contributions made by us and members of the scheme.

120


-----

Payments to defined contribution schemes are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered a
service that entitles them to the contributions. For the defined benefit pension scheme, the cost of providing
benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the
end of each year. Remeasurement of the obligation, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset
ceiling (if applicable) and the return on scheme assets (excluding interest), is recognised immediately in the
balance sheet with a charge or credit to the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which it occurs.
Defined benefit costs, including current service costs, past service costs and gains and losses on curtailments and
settlements are recognised within the income statement as part of operating and administrative expenses in the
period in which they occur. The net interest expense is recognised within finance costs.

The below table sets out the costs for the DPG ESPS for years ended 31 December 2016, 2017 and 2018,
respectively. We note that this table is exclusive of any costs attributable to employees of DGEL Group with
defined benefit rights, which costs are set out in a separate table below.

(1) Current service cost does not include costs in respect of the Scottish Power pension scheme, which historically have ranged from
£2 million to £3 million for the years ended 31 December 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively.

(2) On 26 October 2018, the High Court issued a judgment confirming that defined benefit schemes should be amended to equalise benefits
in relation to guaranteed minimum pensions for men and women. It is not yet agreed how benefits will be equalised in practice;
however, on the grounds that implementation will not lead to any further obligations, our actuarial advisers have initially estimated that
the liabilities of the scheme will increase by £0.6 million as at the date of the court ruling. This has been reflected as a past service cost
in 2018.

The last funding valuation of the DPG ESPS was carried out as of 31 March 2016. The below table sets out
the difference between the present value of the defined benefit obligations and the fair value of the DPG ESPS
assets as at 31 December 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively, and does not include our share of the ScottishPower
Pension Scheme. This difference is recognised in our balance sheet. As a result of the completion of the
valuation, we entered into an agreement with our pension trustees to make deficit repair contributions, totalling
£56 million, from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2025. The agreement also establishes a legally binding journey
plan, which is a mutually agreed plan between us and the pension trustees that seeks to resolve the technical
funding deficit to achieve self-sufficiency using a combination of cash, investment return, change in contractual
provisions and liability management exercises, targeting financial self-sufficiency for the scheme by 2025.

Our share of the ScottishPower Pension Scheme assets and liabilities for the employees to be transferred
into the Drax 2019 Pension Scheme has been calculated for inclusion in the consolidated balance sheet, and
results in a pension scheme surplus of £3.8 million. By adding this amount to the net surplus of £18.9 million
recognised in relation to the DPG ESPS, we recognised a retirement benefit surplus of £22.7 million on our
balance sheet as at 31 December 2018 compared to a deficit of £1.2 million as at 31 December 2017. This
increase in retirement benefit surplus is largely accounted for by an increase in the discount rate used to calculate
future DPG ESPS liabilities to 3.0 per cent. (31 December 2017: 2.6 per cent.) following lower inflation
expectations, which has decreased the value of the DPG ESPS liabilities by £23 million.

**Dividend Policy**

We have a clear capital allocation policy which we have applied throughout 2018. In determining the rate of
growth in dividends from one year to the next the Board will take account of contracted cash flows, the less

121


-----

predictable cash flows from our commodity based business and future investment opportunities. If there is a
build-up of capital, the Board will consider the most appropriate mechanism to return this to shareholders.

On 20 April 2018, we commenced a £50 million share buy-back programme, designed to reduce share
capital and return funds to shareholders. At 31 December 2018, this was substantially complete and we had
bought back £47 million of shares, at an average price of 361 pence per share, which are held in a separate
treasury share reserve. The programme was subsequently completed in January 2019.

At the Annual General Meeting on 17 April 2019 Drax Group plc’s shareholders passed a resolution to
approve payment of a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2018 of 8.5 pence per share (£33.6 million),
payable on or before 10 May 2019. This brings the total dividend payable in respect of 2018 to £56 million. Drax
Group plc paid dividends to its shareholders in an aggregate amount of £50.0 million in respect of 2017 and
£11.0 million in respect of 2016. Our current dividend policy is to pay a dividend consistent with maintaining our
credit rating and investing in our business, and we expect it to grow from the level announced with regards to the
year ended 31 December 2018 (£56.0 million).

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk**

Our activities expose us to a variety of financial risks including commodity price risk, interest rate risk,
foreign currency rate risk, inflation risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk and credit risk. Our overall risk
management programme focuses on the unpredictability of commodity and financial markets and seeks to
manage potential adverse effects on our financial performance.

We use derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposure. Risk management is overseen by
risk management committees, which seek to identify, evaluate and hedge financial risks in close coordination
with our trading and treasury functions under policies approved by the Board.

Except as the context otherwise indicates, the sensitivity analyses discussed under this heading
“Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk” do not include or otherwise account for any
operating results or other financial information from the DGEL Group.

**_Commodity Price Risk_**

We are exposed to the effect of fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly the price of electricity, the
price of gas, the price of coal, the price of sustainable biomass, the costs of transporting biomass such as oil and
freight, and the price of CO2 emissions allowances. Price variations and market cycles have historically
influenced our financial results and are expected to continue to do so.

We have a policy of securing forward electricity sales, purchases of fuel and CO2 emissions allowances
when profitable to do so and in line with specified limits under approved policies. All commitments to sell
electricity under fixed price contracts are designated as cash flow hedges as they reduce our cash flow exposure
resulting from fluctuations in the price of electricity.

We purchase sustainable biomass, coal and other fuels under either fixed or variable priced contracts with
different maturities principally from a number of international sources. We consider all such contracts to be
economic hedges.

When there is less liquidity in the forward wholesale electricity market, we use gas sales as a proxy for
power to mitigate the risk of electricity price fluctuations. We also purchase gas on the wholesale market to meet
the demand of our B2B Energy Supply customers and, following our acquisition of CCGT assets as part of the
DGEL Acquisition, as a fuel for our gas-fired generation portfolio.

We purchase CO2 emissions allowances under fixed price contracts with different maturity dates from a
range of domestic and international sources. All commitments to purchase CO2 emissions allowances under fixed
price contracts are designated as cash flow hedges as they reduce our cash flow exposure resulting from
fluctuations in the price of CO2 emissions allowances.

We purchase guarantee of origin (GoO) certificates from various EU countries. In addition to being used for
fuel labelling purposes, GoOs also exempt our B2B Energy Supply segment from financial obligations under
various low carbon subsidy schemes, such as SS-FiT and the CfD Regime. These certificates ordinarily cost less
than the financial obligations that they offset, creating value and reducing our cost of sales.

If commodity prices had been 5.0 per cent. higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, our loss
after tax for 2018 would increase/decrease by £6.6 million (2017: profit after tax would increase/decrease by

122


-----

£1.5 million, 2016: increase/decrease by £3.4 million), mainly as a result of our exposure to oil derivatives. If
commodity prices had been 5.0 per cent. higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, our hedge
reserve (including any hedge reserve attributable to the DGEL Group as at 31 December 2018) at the end of 2018
would increase/decrease by £18.9 million (2017: increase/decrease by £5.6 million, 2016: increase/decrease by
£36.3 million), mainly as a result of the changes in the fair value of financial coal and electricity derivatives.

The sensitivity analysis above has been determined based on the exposure to commodity prices for
outstanding monetary items at 31 December 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The analysis is based on our
commodity financial instruments held as at 31 December 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

**_Foreign Currency Risk_**

We are exposed to foreign currency risk in connection with coal purchases in US dollars, biomass purchases
in US dollars, Canadian dollars and euro, freight and other associated transportation costs (e.g. oil) in US dollars
and emissions allowances purchases in euro. Foreign currency exchange contracts are entered into to hedge this
exposure. As our biomass transformation plans have progressed, we have entered into an increasing volume of
foreign exchange contracts.

In addition, in order to optimise the cost of funding, we have issued foreign currency denominated debt in
the form of our USD $300 million 2025 fixed rate notes. We utilise derivative contracts to manage exchange risk
on foreign currency debt.

Our current policy is to hedge material transactional exposures using a variety of derivatives to fix the
sterling value of foreign currency cash flows, except where there is an economic hedge inherent in the
transaction. We enter into derivative contracts, including forwards and options, to manage our anticipated foreign
currency requirements over a rolling five-year period.

We also have a limited exposure to translation risk in relation to our net investment in our US subsidiary,
Drax Biomass Inc.

If pound sterling exchange rates had been 5.0 per cent. stronger/weaker against other currencies in 2018 and
all other variables were held constant, our profit after tax for 2018 would increase/decrease by £112.3 million/
£124.7 million (2017 loss after tax: decrease/increase by £351.1 million/£285.5 million). This is mainly
attributable to our exposure to foreign currency exchange contracts entered in relation to fuel purchase contracts.

If pound sterling exchange rates had been 5.0 per cent. stronger/weaker against other currencies in 2018 and
all other variables were held constant, our other equity reserves (including any other equity reserves attributable
to the DGEL Group as at 31 December 2018) would decrease/increase by £160.6 million/£183.6 million, (2017:
decrease/increase by £111.1 million/£122.8 million) as a result of the changes in the fair value of foreign
currency exchange contracts.

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

We have limited exposure to interest rate risk, principally in relation to cash and cash equivalents and
floating rate debt instruments. At 31 December 2018, we had no floating rate debt instruments drawn. We have
taken out a fixed to fixed cross-currency interest rate swap to hedge the future cash flows associated with the
USD $300 million 2025 Senior Secured Notes, effectively converting them to sterling fixed rate cash flows.

The return generated on our cash balance, or on amounts drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility, are also
exposed to movements in short-term interest rates. We manage cash balances to protect against adverse changes
in rates while retaining liquidity.

If interest rates had been 1.0 per cent. higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, our profit
after tax and net assets for 2018 would decrease/increase by £1.0 million (2017: profit after tax would decrease/
increase by £2.2 million) as a result of the changes in interest payable during the period.

The sensitivity analysis above has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for non-derivative
instruments as at 31 December 2018 and 2017, respectively. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared
assuming the amount of the liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.

**_Counterparty Risk_**

As we rely on third-party suppliers and counterparties for the delivery of fuel, a large portion of our
sustainable biomass and other goods and services, we are exposed to the risk of non-performance by these thirdparty suppliers and counterparties. If a large supplier falls into financial difficulty and/or fails to deliver against
the contracts, there would be additional costs associated with securing fuel from other suppliers.

123


-----

We enter into fixed price and fixed margin contracts for the sale of electricity to a number of counterparties.
The failure of one or more of these counterparties to perform their contractual obligations may cause us financial
distress or increase our risk profile. In 2018, one customer in our Power Generation segment represented 10 per
cent. or more of total revenue for the year, generating £555.8 million. In 2017, we did not have any individual
customers representing 10 per cent. or more of total revenue for the year.

**_Credit Risk_**

We are exposed to credit risk with respect to our investments of cash and cash equivalents, other short term
investments, the debtors of our trade and other receivables as well as the counterparties to our derivative financial
instruments.

Our Power Generation and B2B Energy Supply segments are exposed to different levels and concentrations
of credit risk, largely reflecting the number, size and nature of their respective customers. Our Pellet Production
segment only sells products intra-group.

The B2B Energy Supply segment has the most significant credit risk of our operating segments, with a high
number of customers of varying sizes operating in a variety of markets. In particular, Opus Energy carries lower
concentrations but higher levels of credit risk owing to a customer base comprised largely of smaller retail and
commercial entities. Impairment losses in our income statement increased by £12.7 million, or 67.9 per cent.,
from £18.7 million in 2017 to £31.4 million in 2018 reflecting an increase in bad debt charges experienced by the
B2B Energy Supply segment primarily due to the challenging market for many of our customers.

In the B2B Energy Supply segment, credit risk is managed by checking a company’s creditworthiness and
financial strength both before commencing trade and during the business relationship. Credit risk is monitored
and managed by business sector. In addition the B2B Energy Supply segment extended its trade credit insurance
programme for large customers to further mitigate its credit risk.

For the Power Generation segment, credit risk arises from treasury, trading and energy procurement
activities, as well as through the sale of byproducts from generation activities. Wholesale counterparty credit
exposures are monitored by individual counterparty and by category of credit rating, and are subject to approved
limits. We use master netting agreements to reduce credit risk and net settle payments with counterparties where
net settlement provisions exist, allowing us to offset amounts we owe to counterparties by amounts they owe to
us. In addition, we employ a variety of other methods to mitigate credit risk, including margining, various forms
of parent company guarantee, deed of charge, cash collateral and letters of credit. The majority of the Power
Generation business’s credit risk is with counterparties in related energy industries or with financial institutions.
In addition, where deemed appropriate, we have historically purchased credit default swaps.

The investment of surplus cash is undertaken with the objective of ensuring sufficient liquidity at all times,
so that funds are available to meet liabilities as they fall due, while securing a return from invested funds and
preserving the capital value of those funds within Board-approved policies. These policies manage credit risk
exposure by setting out minimum rating requirements, maximum investment limits with any one counterparty
and maturity profile requirements.

Our gross exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the
balance sheet date, as summarised in the following table:

**Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments**

The Drax Group Audited Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. In connection
with the preparation of the Drax Group Audited Financial Statements, the directors of Drax Group plc are
required to make assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported

124


-----

amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions,
estimates and judgments on historical experience, trends and other factors that management believes to be
relevant at the time the Drax Group Audited Financial Statements are prepared. On a regular basis, management
reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that the Drax Group Audited
Financial Statements are presented fairly and in accordance with IFRS. However, because future events and their
effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from its assumptions and estimates, and
such differences could be material. For a complete discussion of all of our critical accounting estimates and
judgments, see the section captioned “Judgements and estimates” in the 2018 Drax Group Audited Financial
Statements on page F-11.

Management believes that the following accounting policies and estimates are the most critical to aid in
fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require management’s most difficult,
subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are
inherently uncertain.

**_Accounting Treatment Applied to Capacity Market_**

On 15 November 2018 the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union found in favour of a
claim against the European Commission, annulling the Commission’s state aid approval of the UK Capacity
Market. This ruling imposed a standstill period on the Capacity Market, with payments under existing contracts
and future capacity auctions suspended indefinitely until reapproval. The Government have since announced that
they expect the Capacity Market to be reinstated during 2019, and that back-dated payments will be made to
generators who have complied with their capacity obligations during the standstill period. Following the ruling,
we ceased to accrue Capacity Market income in the Power Generation segment. Revenue accrued but unpaid
during the period from 1 October to 31 December 2018 was derecognised due to the current uncertainty over the
recovery of these amounts (totalling £7 million). Reflecting previous Government consultations and
announcements, Capacity Market costs have been accrued in the B2B Energy Supply segment in full.

As we expect the Capacity Market to be reinstated during 2019, with back-payments made to generators, the
suspension has not had a material impact on estimates of future cash flows for the purpose of impairment
analyses in the Power Generation segment, including the OCGT development projects.

**_Certain Remeasurements and Exceptional Items_**

Exceptional items are those transactions that, by their nature, do not reflect our trading performance in the
period, including asset obsolescence charges, acquisition and restructuring costs and refinancing costs.

For a transaction to be considered exceptional, management considers the nature of the transaction, the
frequency of similar events, previous precedent and commercial context. Exceptional items are approved by the
Audit Committee.

Certain remeasurements comprise fair value gains and losses on derivative forward contracts to the extent
those contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, or hedge accounting is not effective, which under IFRS are
recorded in revenue or cost of sales. We regard all of our forward contracting activity to represent an economic
hedge. The impact of excluding these fair value remeasurements is to reflect commodity sales and purchases at
contracted prices (the price paid or received in respect of delivery of the commodity in question), taking into
account the impact of financial trading (such as forward foreign currency purchases), in the adjusted results.

Upon adoption of the IFRS 9, we have recognised fair value gains and losses on certain foreign exchange
forward contracts through other comprehensive income. These gains and losses were previously recognised in the
income statement. As a result, results for the year ended 31 December 2017 have been restated.

**_Accounting Treatment Applied to Acquisition of LaSalle Pellet Production Assets_**

We acquired the assets at the LaSalle pellet production plant on 13 April 2017. Having assessed the
circumstances, notably that the plant was acquired without employees, input or output contracts and required
significant investment prior to commissioning, we concluded that the transaction represented an asset purchase
and not the acquisition of a business. Accordingly, the assets have been recognised as additions to property, plant
and equipment in the year. Had business combination accounting been applied, the assets and liabilities of the
plant would have been consolidated line-by-line into the Group’s financial statements, with any difference
between the consideration paid and the fair value of the net assets acquired recognised as goodwill or a gain on
bargain purchase.

125


-----

**_Accounting Treatment Applied to Acquisition of DGEL_**

We acquired DGEL on 31 December 2018. Having assessed the circumstances, we concluded that the
transaction represented the acquisition of a business and not an asset purchase. Accordingly, the transaction has
been treated as a business combination in the financial statements.

**_Property, Plant and Equipment_**

Property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight line basis over its useful economic life. Estimated
useful lives are based on past experience, future replacement cycles and other available evidence; however, a
degree of judgment is required. Useful economic lives are reviewed annually. We reduced the useful lives of
coal-specific generation assets in our Power Generation business from 1 January 2017.

**_Acquired Assets and Liabilities_**

Assets and liabilities acquired through the DGEL Acquisition have been recognised at their fair value in our
consolidated balance sheet. The fair values of the property, plant and equipment have been calculated based on
their depreciated replacement cost, before adjusting to reflect either a premium for immediate availability or a
provision for economic obsolescence, as appropriate.

In addition, the terms of the DGEL Acquisition include a risk-sharing mechanism with the vendor that may
result in a change to the overall level of consideration payable in the event UK Capacity Market payments are not
received during 2019. A further payment may be made by the vendor, or by us, as applicable. The value and
beneficiary of the further payment is dependent upon the gross profit achieved by the DGEL business in 2019
and is capped at £26 million, as described under “Summary—DGEL Acquisition”.

As we believe that the Capacity Market will be reinstated during 2019, with back-payments made to
generators, the fair value of the contingent payment at 31 December 2018 is considered to be £nil. The
contingent arrangement could increase or decrease the fair value of the acquisition consideration in these
financial statements by up to £26 million.

**_Asset Impairment_**

We conduct impairment tests annually for goodwill and for other fixed assets (or, where appropriate, groups
of assets known as cash-generation units (“CGUs”)) when an indicator of possible impairment exists. We
consider the smallest collection of assets that generate independent cash flows to be our operating entities (Drax
Power, Haven Power, Drax Biomass, Opus Energy and the OCGTs) and accordingly consider the Drax Group to
be comprised of five CGUs. The assets of DGEL have been recognised on our consolidated balance sheet as at
31 December 2018 at fair value and are therefore not included in the impairment review at 31 December 2018. If
an indication of a potential impairment exists, the recoverable amount of the asset or CGU in question is assessed
with reference to the future cash flows expected to be derived from the continuing use of the asset or CGU or the
expected price that would be received to sell the asset or CGU to another market participant. If the recoverable
amount is less than the current carrying amount within the financial statements, a provision is made to reduce the
carrying amount of the asset or CGU to the recoverable amount. The assessment of the present value of future
cash flows on which such a review is based is dependent upon a number of assumptions. In particular, expected
future cash flows are based upon the reasonable estimates of future prices, output, costs and economic support
for renewable energy production by management.

In 2015, our market capitalisation fell materially below the carrying value of our net assets. While the
shortfall has reduced considerably during 2017 and 2018, this remained the case as at 31 December 2018. In
addition, commodity markets continued to be weak, we perceived levels of regulatory uncertainty to be high and
the volatility of the pound sterling against both the euro and the US dollar in 2018 indicated a potentially material
increase in the long-term costs of fuel for the Power Generation segment, which are primarily priced in these
currencies. Accordingly, an impairment review of the Drax Power CGU was undertaken as at 31 December 2018.
A review of other CGUs suggested no indicators of impairment and no impairment charge was taken.

**_Derivatives_**

Derivative financial instruments are recorded in the Drax Group Audited Financial Statements at fair value.
The assessment of fair value depends upon assuming a market price for the instrument in question. We base our
assessment of market prices upon forward curves that are largely derived from readily obtainable quotations and
third-party sources. However, any forward curve is based at least in part on assumptions around future

126


-----

transactions and market movements. Where derivative instruments extend beyond the liquid portion of the
forward curve, the level of judgment increases as the number of observable transactions decreases. Where
derivative financial instruments include options, these are valued using an option pricing model. Inputs to the
model include market commodity prices, forward price curves, the term of the option, discount rates and
assumptions around volatility based on historical movements. These inputs include assumptions around future
transactions and market movements and are therefore subjective.

**_Revenue Recognition_**

The nature of some of our activities, particularly within the B2B Energy Supply segment, results in revenue
being based on the estimated volumes of power supplied to customers at an estimated average price per unit.
Assumptions that underpin these estimates are applied consistently and comparison of past estimates to final
settlements suggests a high degree of accuracy. However, given the level of judgment involved, actual outcomes
may vary from initial estimates.

**_ROCs_**

The carrying amount of ROC assets generated by the Group’s Power Generation business in the Group’s
balance sheet is stated at the lower of their deemed cost at the point of generation and expected realisable value,
taking into account anticipated sales prices, and agreed forward sale contracts, where appropriate. ROC
valuations also include an estimate of the future benefits that may be obtained from the recycle fund at the end of
the compliance period. Such estimates are subject to assumptions about likely levels of renewable generation and
supply over the compliance period as well as estimates of likely future sales prices and thus subject to
uncertainty.

**_Pensions_**

We record a liability in our balance sheet for our obligation to provide benefits under an approved defined
benefits pension scheme less the fair value of assets held by the pension scheme. The actuarial valuation of the
scheme assets and liabilities is performed annually and depends on assumptions regarding interest rates, inflation,
future salary and pension increases, mortality and other factors.

An actuarial gain on our defined benefit pension scheme has resulted in an accounting surplus arising on our
defined benefit pension scheme at 31 December 2018. The terms of the Trust Deed allow us to recover any
surplus once the liabilities of the scheme have been settled; accordingly, the surplus has been recognised in full
as a non-current asset on the balance sheet. The net surplus in 2018 includes an initial estimate of amounts due in
respect of the GMP to equalise pension benefits for men and women, following a High Court ruling on
26 October 2018.

**_Taxation_**

In accounting for both current and deferred tax we make assumptions regarding the likely treatment of items
of income and expenditure for tax purposes. These assumptions are based on interpretation of relevant legislation
and, where required, consultation with external advisers.

**Recent Accounting Announcements**

A number of new and amended standards became effective for the first time in 2018. See Note 8.2 to the
2018 Drax Group Audited Financial Statements. We adopted the following from 1 January 2018:

   - IFRS 2—Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions—effective for annual
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.

   - IFRS 9—Financial Instruments—effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January
2018.

   - IFRS 15—Revenue from Contracts with Customers—effective for annual reporting periods beginning on
or after 1 January 2018.

   - IFRIC 22—Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration—effective for annual reporting
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.

On transition to IFRS 9, the key change in the Group’s accounting policy for financial instruments is to
recognise the ‘cost of hedging’ initially in a reserve, rather than the income statement. Amounts are subsequently

127

reclassified from the cost of hedging reserve and recognised in cost of sales in the same period as the hedged
item. This change in policy has been applied retrospectively with comparative information for the period
beginning 1 January 2017 being adjusted as though the cost of hedging approach had always been applied for
those derivatives that existed at or since 1 January 2017. Prior year comparatives have not been restated for other
aspects of IFRS 9, as the effect is not material.

Fair value gains and losses on cash flow hedges are now recognised in other comprehensive income when
they will be recycled directly to the income statement. Gains and losses relating to fuel purchases, which will be
recycled to inventory in the balance sheet, are recognised directly in the hedge reserve.

In respect of accounting for trade and other receivables, the Group has applied IFRS 9’s simplified approach
to provisioning and has calculated this using lifetime expected losses. This calculation has had no material
impact on the financial statements.

Other than the adoption of IFRS 9, these updates and amendments have not had a material impact on the
financial statements of the Group.

The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective are disclosed below. We intend to
adopt these standards, if applicable, when they become effective:

   - IFRS 16 (amended)—Leases—effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January
2019.

  - IFRS 10 (amended)—Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 (amended) Investments in
Associates and Joint Ventures (2011)—effective date deferred indefinitely.

   - IFRIC 23—Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments—effective for annual reports beginning on or after
1 January 2019.

   - IAS 40 (amended)—Investment Property—effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after
1 July 2018.

   - IAS 28 (amended)—Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures—effective from 1 January 2019.

   - IAS 19 (amended)—Employee Benefits—effective from 1 January 2019.

   - IFRS 3 (amended)—Business Combinations—effective from 1 January 2020.

   - Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (amended)—effective from 1 January 2020.

   - IAS 1 (amended)—Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 8 (amended) Accounting Policies,
Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors—effective from 1 January 2020.

   - IFRS 17—Insurance contracts—effective from 1 January 2021.

We adopted IFRS 16 with effect from 1 January 2019. The adoption of this standard will impact our
accounting for lease contracts.

We concluded a preliminary assessment that indicates that a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease
liability of approximately £20 million will be recognised on transition to the new standard in 2019. This value is
lower than the value of non-cancellable minimum lease payments owing to the existence of short-term and lowvalue leases, and the effect of discounting.

The preliminary assessment indicates that £18 million of the existing lease obligations relate to short-term
and leases of low value assets. The effect of discounting has been estimated for the purpose of this analysis. The
anticipated effect on profit or loss (compared to 2018 results for lease contracts in existence at the balance sheet
date) is a reduction in administrative and operating expenses of approximately £5 million, offset by increases in
depreciation of approximately £4 million and finance costs of approximately £1 million.

Due to the timing of the transaction, we have not yet completed any detailed analysis of lease contracts
acquired as part of the DGEL Acquisition for this purpose.

Adoption of the other standards in future periods is not expected to have a material impact on the financial
statements of the Drax Group.

**The UK Electricity Industry**

The principal sectors of the UK electricity industry are:

   - Generation: the production of electricity;

   - Transmission and distribution: the transfer of electricity across the high-voltage electricity transmission
network (the “Transmission System”) and the delivery of electricity from the Transmission System
through low voltage local distribution networks to customers (the “Distribution System”);

   - Wholesale: the buying and selling of wholesale electricity by traders, generators, suppliers and other
wholesale market participants; and

   - Supply: the supply of electricity by authorised suppliers to customers.

**_Overview of the Generation Sector_**

In 2018, approximately 45 per cent. of the electricity produced in the UK was generated by power stations
which produce heat by burning fossil fuels such as coal (approximately 4 per cent.), oil (less than 1 per cent.) or
natural gas (approximately 40 per cent.). Additionally, 20 per cent. of the electricity produced in the same period
in the UK was generated by nuclear power stations and 33 per cent. was generated from a range of renewable
energy sources, such as burning biomass, and from water, solar and wind. Pumped-storage facilities provided
approximately 1 per cent. of electricity in the same period. Incineration of household and industrial waste and
burning gases emitted from landfill sites are also used to generate electricity. This diversity of electricity
generation is a key contributor to security of supply.

_Coal and oil-fired power stations_

Until 1996, coal and oil-fired power stations represented the largest proportion of electricity generation
capacity in the UK. Since then, the trend in generation has been the growth of gas-fired and renewable generation
and the displacement of coal and oil-fired generation, with the share of generation from gas increasing to
approximately 40 per cent. in 2018.

In November 2015, the Government announced its intention to phase out electricity generation from coal by
2025 in order to reduce overall CO2 emissions, and has stated that the capacity reduction from the closure of coal
plants by 2025 should be replaced by less carbon-intensive energy sources, such as gas. In January 2018, the
Government restated its intention and announced the introduction of an emissions intensity limit, which, when
enacted, will make generation from unabated coal units uneconomic. In 2016 and 2017, coal plants with an
aggregate capacity of 5.4GW were closed in the UK. The 2GW Eggborough coal plant in Yorkshire closed in
September 2018 and the 2GW Cottam coal plant in Nottinghamshire is due to close in September 2019, after
which there will be only six active coal-fired power plants remaining in the UK.

_Gas-fired stations_

There are two primary types of gas-fired station: combined cycle gas turbine stations (“CCGT”) and open
cycle gas turbine stations (“OCGT”). In an OCGT power station, the hot gases created by natural gas or gas-oil
combustion are used to drive a turbine which provides the power to generate electricity. In CCGT power stations,
the exhaust from the gas turbine is sent through a boiler to produce steam to drive a steam turbine generator,
producing additional electricity from the same fuel. CCGTs are generally fueled by natural gas, although some
stations have the capability to burn gas-oil.

129


-----

Modern OCGT and CCGT plants in the UK are generally capable of varying output upon shorter notice than
existing coal-fired units, and hence are more responsive to short-term demand changes. Since 1990, CCGT
power stations have provided the vast majority of new thermal generating capacity in the UK due to their greater
efficiency compared to OCGT power stations. However, in recent years, the growth in inflexible, intermittent
renewable capacity has led to a need for more flexible thermal generation to respond to fluctuations in
intermittent output and, accordingly, many new thermal power stations in development are smaller OCGT power
stations which are cheaper to build and able to react more quickly to fluctuations in electricity demand.

Gas was the dominant fuel type in the UK energy mix in 2018 with over 129TWh of generation from
gas-fired plant, more than the generation from nuclear and wind combined.

_Nuclear power stations_

Nuclear power stations in the UK are designed to operate for sustained periods at relatively constant output
levels and are not well suited to varying output quickly. Their low variable (as opposed to fixed) costs also mean
that they have a commercial incentive to generate as much electricity as possible, and therefore continue to
generate electricity during periods when market prices are low. While in 2018 nuclear power stations accounted
for 20 per cent. of the electricity generated in the UK, a significant number of existing nuclear plants in the UK
are due to be retired by the end of the 2020s.

_Biomass-fired generation_

Biomass is biological material obtained from living, or recently living, organic matter (such as plants and
trees) that can be converted into electricity, fuel and heat. Biomass generation is considered a supply of
renewable energy because sourced and burnt biomass can be replaced through re-plantings and the CO2 that is
emitted from burning the harvested biomass can be absorbed by the new plant growth through the process of
photosynthesis. When biomass is sourced sustainably, the conversion of coal-firing power stations to burning
biomass, or co-firing biomass with fossil fuels, can offer a relatively quick, cost-effective way to reduce carbon
emissions from electricity generation in the short to medium term.

There is a variety of sources of biomass, from forestry residues (branches, tops and other low-grade wood)
to dedicated energy crops. Biomass is the fourth largest fuel source in the world after oil, coal and gas.

One of the types of sustainable biomass feedstock comes in the form of pellets produced from thinnings,
branches, tops and other low-grade wood fibre, together with sawmill chips and sawdust. Co-firing and converted
coal plants usually require high-grade ‘clean’ wood pellets, with a high energy density to enhance plant
efficiency.

A generator’s technical specification for industrial wood pellets is influenced by the combustion technology
(the design of boiler, burners and other equipment) and the logistics facilities (transport off/on-site and storage
capacity) associated with the plant where it is intended to be used. The combustion technology determines the
limitations of tolerable chemical composition and the logistics facilities influence the physical quality
requirements.

Biomass is the only low-carbon technology capable of providing flexible, reliable electricity and system
support services at scale, which gives it an advantage over intermittent forms of renewable electricity generation.
This form of technology is in the process of being adopted and developed in Japan, South Korea and Western
Europe.

_Other renewables_

Apart from biomass, electricity in the UK is generated from other renewable energy sources including wind
(both onshore and offshore), solar/photovoltaic, hydro, bioenergy (including landfill gas, sewage sludge
digestion, heat pumps and deep geothermal energy) and energy from waste combustion (both household and
industrial) technologies. Some of these energy sources, in particular wind and solar, generate electricity only on
an intermittent basis.

_Energy storage technologies_

Energy storage technologies can be used by generators to provide a flexible, reliable source of electricity
supply and to provide system support services, including grid balancing services. These features are likely to be
increasingly important with the UK energy sector’s move away from baseload generation in favour of flexible,
intermittent supply.

130


-----

_Pumped storage_

Pumped storage is currently the dominant method of storing electricity at grid scale, accounting for
approximately 95 per cent. of installed storage capacity in the world. It is the only storage technology that forms
a notable proportion of the UK’s energy mix. Pumped-storage sites are based around two reservoirs at different
altitudes. Water is released from the upper reservoir to the lower reservoir during periods of high electricity
demand with the downflow directed through a turbine which drives a generator to create electricity. The water is
then pumped back to the upper reservoir when low-cost, off-peak electric power is available to run the same
turbines which also act as pumps. Unlike coal and nuclear stations, pumped-storage stations can generate power
in minutes, allowing for quick reactions to variance in grid demand.

_Battery storage_

The advancement of battery storage technology has increased rapidly in the last few years. Whilst still a
nascent technology at large-scale, it is likely to play an increasingly broad role in the energy markets with a range
of applications and has the potential to have a significant impact on the energy sector. On the supply side, large,
grid-scale battery storage allows electricity to be generated when it is most efficient and cost effective, stored and
then released to the grid during periods of high electricity demand. On the demand side, advances in battery
technology may make it increasingly economical for I&C customers (and to a lesser extent, domestic customers)
to use storage to reduce their consumption levels at peak demand and to store excess electricity from their own
embedded generation.

**_Contribution to generation by fuel type_**

According to DBEIS’s figures for the third quarter of 2018, generation from coal and gas represented
approximately 3 per cent. and 39 per cent. of the electricity generated in the UK, respectively. In the
corresponding period, generation from nuclear fuel and renewable sources contributed approximately 23 per cent.
and 33 per cent. of electricity generation, respectively. Renewable sources consist of wind and solar (20 per cent.
of total generation), bioenergy (12 per cent. of total generation, including biomass) and other renewables (1 per
cent. of total generation).

**Transmission and Distribution Sector**

_Overview of the transmission and distribution sector_


The Transmission System carries electricity long distances around the UK at high voltages. It includes the
overhead lines, underground cables and substations which connect the large generation assets and interconnectors
to the distribution system. The Transmission Owner owns and operates the Transmission System in Great Britain,
and the System Operator co-ordinates and directs electricity flows on to and over the Transmission System,
balancing generation supply and user demand.

The Distribution System carries a lower voltage than the Transmission System through networks of
overhead lines, underground cables and substations. The Distribution System takes over the role of transporting
electricity from the Transmission System and delivers it to customers at a voltage they can use. Whereas large
electricity producers are connected directly to the national Transmission System, smaller-scale power stations
can be connected directly to the Distribution System on a regional basis. These smaller-scale power stations
currently receive various financial benefits (“embedded benefits”) as a result of their direct connection to the
Distribution System. In June 2017, Ofgem announced the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority’s decision to
reduce by up to 93 per cent. the level of embedded benefits for smaller embedded generators in order to prevent
market distortion and protect customers. This decision came into force in April 2018.

The Transmission System is linked by interconnectors to the Transmission Systems of France, the
Netherlands, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and, following completion of Nemo Link in January 2019,
Belgium. These interconnectors provide an additional 5GW of capacity in aggregate. Interconnectors connect the
UK to other countries’ electricity systems via subsea cables, allowing market participants to trade electricity
between the UK and those countries. European legislation requires nearly all interconnection capacity, with some
exemptions for long-term interconnection contracts, to be allocated to the wholesale market by way of auction.

In May 2014, the Government introduced the “Cap and Floor” regulatory regime to encourage investment in
electricity interconnectors. Interconnectors developed under this regime will earn revenue from the allocation of
capacity to users who want to flow electricity between the UK and its neighbouring countries. In the scenario
where an interconnector does not earn sufficient revenue from its operation, the gap between its revenue and the
floor level will be transferred from the System Operator, which will recover cost through the transmission
charges to users of the electricity Transmission System in Great Britain. Alternatively, should the interconnector
earn in excess of the cap, the surplus will be transferred back to the System Operator.

The pilot Cap and Floor project, Nemo Link, a 1GW subsea cable between Herdersbrug on the Belgian cost
and Richborough in Kent, UK, became operational in January 2019. In 2015 applications for a further five
interconnector investment projects were successfully awarded under the Cap and Floor regime, and these projects
are expected to become operational between 2020 and 2022. In January 2018, the GridLink, NeuConnect and

132


-----

NorthConnect interconnector projects were granted in principle awards under the Cap and Floor regime and will
progress to the final project assessment.

_Ancillary Services_

Due to the growing dependency on intermittent renewable energy, Ancillary Services contracts are offered
to electricity generators. This provides system support to the System Operator as it maintains a reliable system
through the procurement of balancing, frequency response and reactive power. As more conventional power
stations (typically thermal plants) reach the end of their useful lives, there are fewer market participants capable
of providing Ancillary Services.

Following the increase in system volatility, the System Operator has a growing need for system support
services. For example, in June 2017, the System Operator published a report stating that it predicted that within
five years over 60 per cent. of settlement periods for electricity may require corrective action to manage grid
frequency changes.

The System Operator includes the total cost of delivering Ancillary Services within the Balancing Services
Use of System charged to generators and suppliers (“BSUoS”), consisting of the internal and external costs borne
by the System Operator in order to balance the system.

**Wholesale**

_Overview of the wholesale electricity market_

The wholesale market consists of electricity generators producing electricity and selling their output to
electricity suppliers who in turn sell electricity to customers. Market participants tend to be focused on either the
sale of electricity from generation or the purchase of electricity for supply; however, certain market participants
have an interest in both, or alternatively act as intermediaries with no underlying generating assets or supply
business. Wholesale trades are entered via a number of platforms, including bilaterally, through brokered
platforms or on exchanges. Wholesale trades involve various time frames, from contracts for several years ahead
to same-day trading markets and can involve the delivery of electricity for short (half-hours) or long (seasons)
fixed periods.

The wholesale electricity market trades across three sub-markets:

   - the long-term forward market, allowing contracts to be struck up to several years ahead of delivery in
response to market participants’ requirements;

   - the short-term market, operated predominantly through electricity exchanges, which gives market
participants the opportunity to fine tune their contractual positions; and

   - the real-time market, through which the System Operator accepts offers and bids for electricity to enable
it to balance supply and demand on the system.

Energy cannot be easily stored in large volumes at present (with the exception of the storage capacity
supplied by a limited number of pumped storage facilities and given the infancy of large-scale battery storage
technology), and so, to ensure a secure supply of electricity to end users, the volume of generated electricity must
match the volume being consumed. The System Operator matches, on a real-time basis, the generation and
consumption of electricity in Great Britain to ensure the stability of the electricity system and maintenance of
satisfactory voltage and frequency. Where necessary, the System Operator pays sources of generation or
consumption to increase or decrease their generation or consumption.

Electricity is traded in 30-minute blocks and each generator and supplier (except for certain smaller market
participants) has metering that measures, or estimates, its total generation or aggregate consumption in each 30minute block. Generators and suppliers (together with other entities) trade voluntarily with each other until the
hour before the start of a 30-minute block (a point in time referred to as “gate closure”). At gate closure, ideally
the volume of electricity that generators have contracted to generate and that suppliers have contracted to
consume should be equal, resulting in a balanced electricity system. After gate closure, it is the System
Operator’s responsibility to ensure that the electricity system is balanced.

Generators and suppliers of electricity are incentivised to contract accurately for the volume of electricity
they intend to generate or consume in any 30-minute block. Any imbalance in volume between generators and
suppliers results in an “imbalance charge” on the difference between the contractual volume and the metered
volume in that 30-minute block. This imbalance charge is generally at a less favourable (and less certain) price

133


-----

than the wholesale market price for that particular 30-minute block, which further incentivises generators and
suppliers to contract as accurately as possible. Imbalance charges are intended to reflect the costs incurred by the
System Operator on behalf of the electricity industry when it has to increase or reduce electricity generation or
consumption to balance the electricity system.

_Wholesale prices_

The market price for wholesale electricity is affected by a number of factors, including the prices of
underlying commodities such as oil, natural gas, coal and biomass; the cost of carbon in the form of emission
allowances under the EU ETS and Carbon Price Support; the availability and form of generating capacity on the
electricity system; the physical positions taken by individual market participants; and wider economic conditions.

A power station needs to achieve enough revenue per MWh to cover its variable costs, including fuel,
carbon and some variable operation and maintenance costs, to be economically viable to operate in the short
term. Electricity prices are set by the intersection of demand and supply, which is demonstrated by the “merit
order” principle. The merit order describes the short-run marginal cost of available electricity generation in
ascending order for a particular market, against the corresponding amount of energy that will be generated.

Power stations available to generate can be modelled, according to their different costs of generation, as a
stack, which is overlaid with forecast demand for electricity. The available power stations are drawn on to supply
electricity to fulfil this demand, starting with the power stations that have the lowest cost of generation. At the
point in the demand stack where forecast demand intersects with available supply, the power station supplying
electricity at the point of intersection is known as the “marginal plant”. The marginal price at which the marginal
plant is willing to generate therefore dictates the prevailing market price.

The fuel type of the marginal plant is the fundamental driver of the market price. A power station’s cost of
generation is determined largely by the cost of the type of fuel used, which cost can be susceptible to market
forces and can fluctuate widely. Some power stations have negative costs of generation, such as those which use
wind or solar, since the subsidies provided to renewable generators are greater than their minimal cost of
generation.

A power station’s cost of generation is also affected by its efficiency. Among power stations that depend on
the same source of fuel, the range of efficiencies fluctuates depending on each power station’s technology and
level of underlying investment. The cost of generation can therefore vary significantly between plants, despite
the same type of fuel being used.

In the illustrative example of a demand stack below for Winter 2019, if demand were forecast as 56GW, a
coal-fired power station would be the marginal plant and would set the market price. If, however, demand was
forecast between 23GW and 52GW, a CCGT power station would be the marginal plant and would set the
market price.

The price for generated electricity can therefore fluctuate in line with the merit order, reflecting different
efficiencies, fuel costs and renewable capacity available in the market.

134


-----

**Supply**

Total electricity demand in the UK is approximately 300 TWh each year, with approximately one-third
relating to domestic demand and two-thirds to non-domestic demand. As of June 2018, there were approximately
28 million retail electricity meter points and 23 million retail gas meter points in the domestic market and
approximately 2.5 million retail electricity meter points and 1.5 million retail gas meter points in the
non-domestic market.

In the domestic market, contracts for electricity supply are often combined with domestic gas supply in dual
fuel contracts. The types of these contracts are varied but tend to be simple rolling tariff or fixed-term contracts,
sometimes with an automatic roll over into an open-ended, variable price contract at the end of the fixed term.

The non-domestic market can broadly be divided into two sub-sectors: the SME sector comprising smaller
companies and micro-enterprises; and the I&C sector. Contract types and pricing structures vary greatly,
particularly in the larger I&C market, where contracts are often bespoke.

As of October 2015, there were approximately 1.8 million SME electricity meters and approximately
0.9 million I&C electricity meters, with 37TWh and 151TWh electricity consumption, respectively. Compared to
the I&C segment, the SME market has a lower energy consumption per meter and higher gross margins per
MWh.

Customers may require that all, or a defined proportion, of the electricity for which they contract is
generated from renewable sources. The fungible nature of electricity makes it impossible to trace a particular
volume of electricity back to its source of generation, so instead the provenance of the renewable electricity is
demonstrated by the supplier acquiring various renewables certificates. The extra cost of renewable electricity is
ordinarily passed through to the customer as part of the contract (whether expressly stated or otherwise) and so
electricity sold pursuant to these products tends to be more costly than the corresponding volumes of
non-renewable electricity. The extra cost of renewable electricity, however, is also mitigated, and often offset, by
various exemptions from charges applied to non-renewable electricity.

**Privatisation and Market Evolution**

The UK electricity market was privatised in 1990, introducing competition among those companies that
succeeded the nationalised Electricity Boards into both the generation and, to a limited extent, the supply
markets. Competition in the supply market increased in stages until it was fully developed by 1999, at which
point no geographical franchises remained.

Following a period of consolidation among suppliers and generators and, in many cases, subsequent
acquisition by large overseas utilities groups, the wholesale market became dominated by the “Big Six”
vertically-integrated energy companies which owned large market shares in both generation and supply: British
Gas (owned by Centrica), EDF Energy, npower (owned by Innogy SE), E.ON (now focused on retail supply after
spinning off and selling its conventional generation assets as Uniper), SSE and Scottish Power (owned by
Iberdrola, S.A.). As of January 2019, these companies together supplied energy to approximately 75 per cent. of
domestic customers in the UK. On the supply side, over recent years, the Big Six have lost market share in the
non-domestic segment to other energy generators and stand-alone suppliers, including to Drax through Haven
Power and Opus. As of June 2018, the Big Six held less than 70 per cent. market share in the large-scale nondomestic segment compared to 82.4 per cent. in October 2012. In response to the changing regulatory
environment and increased competition, the Big Six are reducing their level of vertical integration. For example,
E.ON completed a demerger in 2016 which hived off its thermal generation business into a separate group,
Uniper, and a plan to merge the supply businesses of Innogy (npower) and SSE into a separate entity was formed
in 2018 only to be abandoned later in the year due to challenging market conditions. A wider asset swap deal
involving Innogy’s parent RWE and E.ON has also been signed and is pending regulatory approval.

**Electricity Market: Regulatory Context**

**_Capacity constraints_**

The UK electricity market is experiencing significant structural change. As additional intermittent
renewable generation capacity is commissioned, the market share of such capacity is expected to increase while,
at the same time, a substantial proportion of conventional electricity generation comes offline. While some
retirements are attributable to the end of operating life, in the case of coal, the prohibitive costs of complying
with emissions targets and other environmental regulations have reduced their economic viability. The feasibility
of projects has been further affected by the low wholesale price environment that has been experienced in the
energy market from 2014 until relatively recently and a Capacity Market structure that has favoured lowest capex
and low load factor generation, resulting in no significant new thermal plants successfully clearing the auctions.

As shown on the below graph, the average De-rated Reserve Margin for the last five years was 7.4 per cent.

**UK Generation: Spare Electricity Capacity**

Due to Government initiatives implemented in an effort to meet EU regulation and recent international
developments (such as during the COP-21 conference in 2015), a significant share of the UK’s CO2 intensive
generation capacity is expected to be taken offline, as the UK’s power stations age and as EU environmental
legislation, notably the Industrial Emissions Directive (“IED”), impose stricter standards. This primarily relates
to coal-fired and oil-fired plants, which may not be able to comply with new regulation in respect of CO2
emissions in certain circumstances. The IED was enacted to reduce emissions of SO2, oxides of nitrogen and dust
from large combustion plants. A number of coal-fired and oil-fired plants that did not comply with the IED’s
predecessor, the Large Combustion Plant Directive, were required to close by the end of 2015, driving the need
for new generation plants to be commissioned in order to maintain the UK’s security of electricity supply. The
Best Available Techniques Reference document for Large Combustion Plants developed under the IED imposes
requirements on generators that will further reduce air emission limits when it enters into force no later than
mid-2021.

DBEIS forecasts that approximately 4GW of existing nuclear power (approximately 8 per cent. of peak
demand) will be taken out of production by 2024. DBEIS projections also suggest an increase in generation
capacity of 32GW from all technologies by 2035 compared to 2017, including an increase in nuclear generation
capacity of 5GW.

The UK is currently in the process of developing new nuclear capacity with the decision on Hinkley Point C
approving what will be the first nuclear power station built in the UK since 1995. Hinkley Point C will have
capacity of 3.2GW, with total expected costs of approximately £20 billion with a secured CfD strike price of

136


-----

£92.5/MWh (as of 2012, subject to adjustment for consumer price inflation) for a term of 35 years following the
commissioning of each generation unit. However, according to news sources, Hinkley Point C is running
significantly over budget and behind schedule (as of July 2017, by £1.5 billion and 15 months, respectively).
Furthermore, plans to build a nuclear power station at Moorside in Cumbria were halted after NuGeneration
Limited, a subsidiary of Toshiba Corporation, announced liquidation in November 2018 and in January 2019,
Horizon Nuclear Power Limited, a subsidiary of Hitachi Group, suspended works on its Wylfa Newydd plant.
Together the failure to develop these new plants in substitution of existing retiring plants would result in a 9GW
shortfall in nuclear generation capacity.

**Global and European Context For Renewable Energy**

The global and national markets for renewable energy are policy-driven markets resulting from initiatives
designed to generate economic incentives for the reduction of greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, thereby
mitigating the onset of climate change and helping to improve security of energy supply.

At an international level, the regulation of GHG, including CO2, is directed by the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (the “UNFCCC”) and the Kyoto Protocol to that Convention (the
“Kyoto Protocol”). The Kyoto Protocol came into force in 2005, and provides an international framework for
the reduction of GHG emissions, legally committing the ratifying countries to making these reductions.

The UK is a party to the UNFCCC and has signed and ratified the Kyoto Protocol as part of the EU
commitment for the reduction of GHG emissions. The first commitment period for the Kyoto Protocol ended in
2012. A second commitment period was agreed at the Doha Conference in December 2012 (the “Doha
**Amendment”) and runs from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2020. In 2015, the UNFCCC’s 195 member**
countries agreed, at the COP-21 conference, to sign the Paris Agreement, which committed them to the target of
holding the increase in the global average temperature to below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue
efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C, which effectively committed the world to becoming carbonneutral after 2050. The Paris Agreement entered into force on 4 November 2016. In August 2017, the US
formally notified its intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement effective from November 2020. However,
other signatory countries have not followed suit, with many re-affirming their commitments.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has calculated that 70-85 per cent. of global electricity will
need to come from renewables by 2050 if the target set out in the Paris Agreement of limiting the worldwide
temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels is going to be achieved. Given that most renewable
generation is intermittent in nature, the remaining generation will need to be supported by flexible,
complementary renewable or low carbon sources such as biomass, hydro and pumped storage.

**European Clean Energy Legislative Framework**

In 2008, following the international commitments made under the Kyoto Protocol, the European
Commission presented the second Strategic Energy Review package, a set of energy and climate change
measures for the EU known as the “20-20-20” initiative, aimed at achieving a 20 per cent. reduction in GHG
emissions, a 20 per cent. share for renewables in final energy consumption, and improving energy efficiency by
reducing energy demand by 20 per cent. by 2020.

One of the main pieces of legislation supporting renewable generation at the EU level is the Renewable
Energy Directive (2009/28/EC) (the “Renewable Energy Directive”). Under the Renewable Energy Directive,
EU Member States are required to adopt national targets for renewables that are consistent with reaching the
European Commission’s overall EU target of a 20 per cent. share of energy from renewable sources relative to
final energy consumption from all sources by 2020. In December 2018, the Recast Renewable Energy Directive
((EU) 2018/2001) (“RED II”) came into force, introducing a binding EU-level target for a minimum 32 per cent.
share of energy from renewable sources in gross final consumption of energy by 2030. To meet these overall
targets, EU Member States are asked to set their own national targets. As in many sectors, it is difficult to predict
the impact of Brexit on energy regulation.

**The Push Towards Renewable Energy**

According to DBEIS, the increase in lower carbon technologies in the UK will be largely driven by the
capacity growth in wind, solar, nuclear and gas. To meet the UK’s target of 15 per cent. primary consumption
from renewable sources, without compromising the security of supply in the system, the UK electricity system
may become increasingly reliant upon the construction of new CCGTs and OCGTs, expand in non-intermittent
renewable energy (e.g., biomass) and depend on increased imports of electricity through interconnectors.

The desire to address climate change, along with supply pressures, has led to a number of regulatory and
market initiatives in the UK. In particular, successive Governments have been supportive of the growth of
renewable energy, as demonstrated by the legislation passed and policies issued in recent years.

_The EU Emissions Trading System_

In 2005, the EU ETS, a cap-and-trade scheme for EU Allowances (“EUAs”) was introduced. The system
operates by placing a cap on the total CO2 emissions from industrial sectors and energy-intensive industries
which are covered by the scheme. At the end of each year of the scheme, each installation needs to submit a
number of EUAs, equal to its CO2 emissions in the period. The scheme is now in its third phase, which runs from
2013 to 2020 (Phase One ran from 2005 to 2007, and Phase Two ran from 2008 to 2012).

The fourth phase, which runs from 2021 to 2030, is currently under review on the basis of the European
Commission’s legislative proposal presented in July 2015. The revision suggests a more aggressive pace of
emission cuts, declining the total emission allowances at an annual rate of 2.2 per cent. compared to 1.7 per cent.
currently. Additionally, it is proposed to better target carbon leakage rules and encourage low-carbon innovation
and modernisation of the energy sector. The eventual application to the UK of this fourth phase is uncertain given
the impact of Brexit.

The largest sector covered by the EU ETS is the electricity sector. The marginal cost of a thermal nonrenewable generator is therefore increased by its cost of purchasing EUAs to cover any carbon emissions over
each compliance period. As such, while non-renewable generation is the price-setter, the value of emissions is
reflected in the price of wholesale electricity, as adjusted for the carbon intensity of that form of electricity
generation. The wholesale electricity price is therefore generally considered to include the cost of carbon
emissions, in addition to fuel and other costs incurred by the generator.

The ability to trade excess emission allowances is an incentive to companies to reduce overall emissions by
investing in more efficient technology or shifting to less carbon-intensive energy sources, in return for receiving
additional revenue. Consequently, the carbon price fluctuates based on the supply and demand of emission
allowances. Historically, in depressed economic conditions, the market was oversupplied with unused emission
allowances, trading at a significantly lower price, and thereby minimising any disincentive for the energy market
to generate electricity from more carbon-intensive coal-fired plants. The market price of emissions allowances
increased significantly in 2018 relative to 2017 in anticipation of the introduction of the Market Stability Reserve
in January 2019 which aims to address the current surplus of allowances by reducing the supply of allowances to
be auctioned. New market entrants and the switching of generation from gas to coal by some generators due to
high gas prices also contributed to the increased market price of emissions allowances.

The details of the UK’s future legislative and regulatory framework in relation to carbon emissions and
carbon pricing is currently unclear as a result of Brexit. In particular, the UK’s status as a participant in the EU
ETS post-Brexit is unclear. The EU ETS is currently an important part of the UK’s total carbon price (along with
the Carbon Price Support). If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement as to the terms of its withdrawal (i.e. a
“no deal” scenario), the Government has confirmed that the UK would cease to participate in the EU ETS and a
carbon emissions tax would be introduced to help meet the UK’s legally binding carbon reduction commitments
under the Climate Change Act 2008. Beginning in 2019 (at a time to be yet established by the UK Government),
a rate of £16 would be applied to each tonne of carbon dioxide emitted over and above an installation’s emissions
allowance, which would be based on the installation’s free allowance allocation under the EU ETS. When added
to the current Carbon Price Support, this would effectively increase the UK’s total carbon emissions tax to
£34 per tonne, compensating for the loss of the EU ETS.

The Government has indicated that it is continuing to develop options for long-term carbon pricing,
including remaining in the EU ETS, establishing a UK ETS (linked to the EU ETS or standalone) or a carbon tax.

**UK Clean Energy Legislation**

The Renewable Energy Directive sets a target for the UK of 15 per cent. for primary energy consumption
from renewables by 2020. The Government released a Renewable Energy Roadmap (last updated in November
2013) designed to achieve that objective. It follows on from the Renewable Energy Strategy issued in June 2009,
the UK’s National Renewables Energy Action Plan submitted to the European Commission in July 2010 and the
original Renewable Energy Roadmap published in July 2011. The 2011 Roadmap highlighted eight technologies
which the Government expects to provide over 90 per cent. of the UK’s 2020 15 per cent. renewable energy
target. These technologies include onshore and offshore wind, biomass electricity, biomass heat, marine (wave
and tidal), ground source heat pumps, air source heat pumps and renewable transport.

138


-----

During the last decade, the UK energy market has changed significantly due to the increase in intermittent,
renewable generation technology, the increase in the amount of self-supply and embedded generation and the
closure of significant volumes of thermal plants. This trend is expected to continue, as illustrated in the chart
below:

**Change in UK Generation Capacity**

Source: Digest of UK Energy Statistics and Future Energy Scenarios and National Grid


A large proportion of renewable generation is intermittent in nature and, accordingly, the Government
estimates that approximately 30 per cent. of the UK’s electricity capacity will need to come from renewable
sources by 2020 in order to ensure that the 15 per cent. overall renewable primary energy consumption target
under the Renewable Energy Directive is met. As such, the Government has introduced incentive and support
schemes to help achieve that target.

**_Renewable energy supplier schemes in the UK_**


To incentivise the move to electricity generation from renewables, the UK has introduced a number of
support measures, principally:

(i) the Climate Change Act 2008 (“CCA”);


(ii) the RO Scheme;

(iii) the Carbon Price Floor;


(iv) the CfD Regime, including Investment Contracts; and


(v) the Small-Scale Feed-in Tariffs (“SS-FiT”) scheme.

Both the Carbon Price Floor and the CfD Regime were measures introduced under the wider proposals for
Electricity Market Reform discussed below.


_The Climate Change Act 2008_

The CCA was introduced to establish a framework to develop an economically credible emissions reduction
path. The CCA commits the UK to an 80 per cent. reduction in GHG emissions by 2050, relative to 1990 levels.
The CCA also established the Committee on Climate Change (“CCC”), which advises the Government and
devolved administrations on progress towards this target. The CCA requires the Government to set legally
binding carbon budgets (a cap on the amount of GHG emitted in the UK over a five-year period). These budgets
are established to serve as a pathway to the final legally binding target for 2050, to reduce emissions by at least
80 per cent. compared to 1990 levels. In June 2016, the Government has committed to CCC’s fifth carbon budget
to reduce UK GHG emissions in 2030 by 57 per cent. relative to 1990 levels. The CCC is expected to publish


139


-----

new advice to the Government and devolved administrations on the UK’s long-term climate change targets in
May 2019.

The CCC’s advice to the Government on carbon budgets and targets is presented to the UK Parliament by
the Government with the ultimate aim of enacting the advice into law.

The international, supranational and national commitments described above are enshrined in law and
underpin the UK’s efforts to mitigate climate change through the deployment of renewable energy. To facilitate
investment in renewable energy and hence meet these legal commitments, the Government has developed
support regimes which sit within and alongside the UK electricity market.

_The Renewables Obligation_

The RO Scheme is a market-based mechanism which has been the main source of financial support from the
Government to large-scale renewable electricity generation in the UK since 2002. The powers required to
establish the RO were included in the Utilities Act 2000, and the detailed mechanics are defined in Renewables
Obligation Orders, which are implemented periodically and the most recent of which came into force on 1 April
2014.

As a result of the proposed transition to the CfD Regime under the Electricity Market Reform, the
Renewables Obligation Closure Order came into force on 9 September 2014, which has closed the RO to new
generation capacity that seeks to be accredited on or after 1 April 2017. As of 1 April 2017, existing projects
already accredited under the RO Scheme (all biomass units at Drax Power Station other than the unit benefitting
from the CfD, our Lanark hydro plant and approximately 28MW of capacity at our Galloway hydro plant) are
expected to remain under the RO Scheme for the remainder of their period of support until at least 2027 (unless
they move onto the CfD Regime instead). See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—The
_reduction or abandonment of governmental support for generation of electricity from biomass or other relevant_
_changes in governmental energy policy may materially adversely affect our business, operations, financial_
_condition and results of operations”._

_Operation of the renewables obligation_

The RO operates in England and Wales, with parallel obligations in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The RO
places an obligation on licensed electricity suppliers either to source a proportion of the electricity they provide
to customers from eligible renewable sources or to make a buy-out payment. The sourcing of renewable energy is
demonstrated by the supplier presenting ROCs (equivalent in number to the supplier’s individual obligation) to
the administrator of the RO Scheme, Ofgem.

ROCs are issued by Ofgem to renewable generators for each MWh of renewable electricity generated in
different proportions based on the type of technology used. Electricity suppliers can source ROCs from
renewable electricity generators. ROCs are tradable commodities that have no fixed price and therefore the
amount an electricity supplier pays for a ROC is a matter for negotiation between the supplier and generator.

If a supplier fails to purchase sufficient ROCs to fulfil its obligation to source renewable electricity, then it
must make a buy-out payment for each of the ROCs it should otherwise have submitted. Buy-out payments are in
turn recycled back to the suppliers in proportion to the amount of ROCs submitted by those suppliers. As such,
the price of ROCs is inversely related to the amount of renewable energy produced: the greater the shortfall
below the target, the greater the buy-out payments to those who did submit ROCs.

DBEIS sets the level of the obligation to source renewable electricity each year using a headroom
calculation. The headroom calculation provides a set margin between the predicted generation (supply of ROCs)
and the level of the obligation (demand for ROCs). This helps reduce the possibility of supply exceeding the
obligation in any given year and therefore the market value of a ROC being diminished. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Fluctuations in the demand for and supply of ROCs could result in_
_the revenues we receive from the sale of ROCs to third party suppliers being substantially lower than_
_anticipated”._

The RO provides for the price of buy-out payments to increase with the retail price index each year,
beginning at £30/MWh in 2002 and now at £48.78/MWh for the compliance period ending on 31 March 2020.

Each RO compliance period begins on 1 April and lasts one year. Suppliers must comply with their
obligation by submitting ROCs for that compliance period (or ROCs for the immediately preceding compliance
period that were not previously submitted) by the September following the end of the compliance period. Ofgem
then collects all the buy-out payments and makes the payment to suppliers approximately one month later. If

140


-----

Ofgem experiences a shortfall in the value of buy-out payments received in excess of £15.4 million during any
given compliance period due to supplier failure then a mutualisation process is initiated whereby the remaining
suppliers are collectively obligated to make up the shortfall.

There is a delay of approximately three months between the generation of a unit of renewable electricity and
the accreditation of the associated ROC in Ofgem’s Renewables and Combined Heat and Power Register. After
this accreditation, the ROC can be transferred.

From the generator’s perspective, the revenue received for each unit of electricity sold under the RO
comprises three main elements, which together constitute the RO all-in price. Each of these three elements has an
independent value and can be sold separately. The three elements are:

   - the revenue realised in the wholesale electricity market: the market price of electricity generated;

   - the revenue realised for selling the ROC: a fixed amount paid by a supplier for the ROC in question
(traditionally a percentage of the buy-out payment avoided by the supplier as a result of having acquired
the ROC instead); and

   - the revenue realised from recycling: a share of the buy-out fund which is recycled back to suppliers and
then typically passed on to generators under the terms of the sale of ROCs.

The price realised for each of these elements must be bilaterally negotiated between the relevant generator
and its counterparty, or counterparties, in the market. Historically, the price of ROCs has been similar to, and
followed the price of, buy-out payments.

_Grandfathering of support under the Renewables Obligation_

A banding system was introduced to regulate the RO in April 2009. This system provides that the numbers
of ROCs received by a generator per MWh of electricity produced differs depending on the type of renewable
generation technology deployed, the principle being that less developed technologies should receive a greater
number of ROCs to encourage their development. However, to mitigate the disturbance that could arise from
banding (and changing ROC awards for projects already in operation or under construction), the banding levels
for most technologies are grandfathered. Grandfathering is a Government policy that allows, once a generating
station is accredited and receiving support under the RO, the level of support received to remain unchanged for
the lifetime of its support. Grandfathering gives generators sufficient certainty of income to make investment in
new renewable generation capacity.

The latest comprehensive banding review occurred in 2012 and provided a level of 1.0 ROC for every MWh
of renewable generation from converted biomass units and 0.9 ROC for every MWh of renewable generation
from high-range, or enhanced, co-firing units. Enhanced co-firing units are defined as units co-firing at least
85 per cent. biomass with fossil fuels such as coal. In April 2013, grandfathering was extended to the biomass
conversion and mid-range co-firing bands and also to the high-range co-firing band in April 2014. For these
bands, grandfathering operates so that, once the generating station has been accredited under the RO,
grandfathering applies to the level of support at the date that the combustion unit moves into the mid-range,
high-range or biomass conversion band. Grandfathering then applies for so long as the combustion unit stays in
that band and ceases to apply as soon as the combustion unit moves into another band. A combustion unit is
treated as moving into a new band from the moment it starts generating electricity in respect of which ROCs
under that new band are issued. However, since 12 December 2014, new biomass conversion units and
combustion units already receiving support under the RO Scheme that move for the first time into the mid-range
co-firing, high-range co-firing or biomass conversion bands, will no longer be covered by the Government’s
grandfathering policy.

In July 2018, the Renewables Obligation (Amendment) Order 2018 came into force, establishing an annual
cap of ROCs received at the power station level for biomass-fired generation facilities. For each power station
with existing grandfathered units, the cap is equal to (i) the forecast level of ROCs to be generated from existing
grandfathered units (such forecast to be determined by DBEIS in line with its RO headroom calculation detailed
above); plus (ii) a unit allowance of 125,000 ROCs per annum per non-grandfathered unit. If and to the extent
that a power station receives fewer ROCs from its grandfathered units than DBEIS forecast for the relevant year,
then this shortfall in ROCs may instead be issued with respect to biomass-fired generation from the
non-grandfathered units in excess of the 125,000 ROCs per annum allowance. This allows generators to flex
generation between grandfathered and non-grandfathered units within the confines of the overall power station
cap, thereby reducing the impact that unplanned outages may have on their ability to generate renewable
electricity and reveive ROCs.

141


-----

_The Renewables Obligation after 2017_

The RO closed to newly accredited renewable generation on 1 April 2017, following which generators are
not able to apply for support under the RO in respect of any new renewable generation (subject to certain grace
periods for certain projects and earlier closure dates for certain projects). All renewable generation plants which
have been accredited before this time are able to continue to receive ROCs based on their grandfathered bands (if
grandfathered) and the headroom principle continues to apply. The Government has recently confirmed that the
RO regime will apply a RO cap at the Power Station level across all RO accredited units, rather than impose a
cap on RO support for future biomass unit conversions. See “—UK clean energy legislation—Grandfathering of
_support under the Renewables Obligation”._

From 1 April 2027 to 31 March 2037, the current buy-out fund system is no longer intended to be in effect,
and all accredited projects that are still receiving ROCs at that time (for many projects, these are scheduled to end
in 2027) will simply receive a fixed payment of 110 per cent. of the buy-out price for their ROCs from a central
body. This procedure is still being finalised. The 2027 buy-out price will be fixed at this point but will continue
to be indexed to the retail price index throughout the remaining 10 years of the RO.

_Climate Change Levy_

The Climate Change Levy (“CCL”) is a tax on energy (electricity, gas, solid fuels) being supplied to
non-domestic customers in the UK, introduced in 2001. Non-domestic customers—to which the CCL applies—
are in the following sectors: industry, commerce, agriculture or public services. The objective of the CCL is to
create an incentive for efficiency in energy usage and reduce CO2 emissions. In its initial form, the CCL
exempted electricity generated from renewable and approved combined heat and electricity schemes. This
exemption was, however, removed from the regime in 2015. Until 1 August 2015, generators of renewable
source electricity received from Ofgem a levy exemption certificate (“LECs”) for each MWh of renewable
source electricity produced. Renewable energy generators could sell their LECs to electricity suppliers who
presented these to HMRC as proof that the electricity they supplied is CCL-exempt. CCL-accredited generators
with remaining LECs have to retire those that are not associated with export to the national transmission and/or
distribution network. On 13 February 2018 Ofgem published guidance on how to retire these certificates.

_Carbon Price Floor_

The Carbon Price Floor was designed to incentivise investment in low-carbon electricity generation by
providing greater support and certainty to the carbon price in the UK’s electricity generation sector. It was
introduced in response to fluctuations in the price of carbon (in the form of EU ETS allowances) which resulted
in uncertainty for investors in low-carbon technologies. With effect from April 2013, the UK implemented a
system of Carbon Price Support which is intended to give investors long-term visibility of a rising carbon price in
the UK, which will be reflected in the future price of UK electricity.

The Carbon Price Support had an original starting level of £4.94/tonne of CO2 for 2013/14. It was originally
expected that the Carbon Price Support level would rise to £30/tonne of CO2 by 2020; however, it is currently
capped at £18/tonne of CO2 until it is uprated with inflation in 2020/2021. In January 2019, the Government
reaffirmed that the UK will maintain a total carbon price (the combination of the Carbon Price Support and the
EU ETS) at around the current level until unabated electricity generation from coal has ended.

_Small-Scale Feed-in Tariffs_

The SS-FiT scheme is a Government programme designed to promote the uptake of a range of small-scale
renewable and low-carbon electricity generation technologies and is available through licensed electricity
suppliers. The SS-FiT scheme requires tariff payments on both generation and supply of renewable and
low-carbon electricity to be made by certain suppliers. Tariff payment rates are index-linked and therefore
increase or decrease with inflation. On 18 December 2018, the Government declared that the scheme would be
closed to new applications beginning 1 April 2019.

**Overview of Electricity Market Reform**

The Electricity Market Reform package was announced in 2010 and has been implemented steadily over
time. Electricity Market Reform was designed to decarbonise electricity generation in the UK, secure the UK’s
energy supply in a capacity-constrained market place and minimise the cost of electricity to customers.

The four main components of the Electricity Market Reform package are:

   - the Carbon Price Support: the implemented tax upon fossil fuels used to generate electricity, set at a price
per tonne (see “—UK clean energy legislation—Carbon Price Floor”);

142


-----

   - CfDs: long-term contracts to support investment in new renewable energy projects;

   - the Capacity Market: this involves the award of Capacity Market agreements to generators which receive
payments in return for committing to generate at times of system stress; it also aims to encourage
investment in demand-side response capacity; and

   - the Emissions Performance Standard (“EPS”): this will cap the amount of carbon emissions that a new
fossil fuel generation plant can emit.

The budget for low-carbon electricity investment across the various support schemes was originally
controlled by a Government framework, the Levy Control Framework. However, in Autumn 2017, the
Government announced a new Control for Low Carbon Levies, which replaced the existing Levy Control
Framework. The LCL Control covers all existing and new low-carbon electricity levies, including the RO
Scheme, the CfD Regime and SS-FiT and affirms the current subsidy support for existing projects, but based on
the current projection of levy spend on such low carbon schemes, it is anticipated that there will be no new low
carbon electricity levies until 2025. Calls for evidence for a review of the Capacity Market and EPS components
of the Electricity Market Reform package (discussed below) were issued in 2018 and the results of the formal
review are expected to be released in summer 2019.

_Contracts for Difference_

In 2011, the Government announced its intention to move from the RO to a scheme based on CfDs in
“Planning our electric future: a White Paper for secure, affordable and low-carbon electricity”. CfDs were
introduced to provide efficient and long-term support for low-carbon generation, and to increase revenue
certainty for generators.

A CfD provides a variable top-up to the wholesale electricity price that a generator can theoretically achieve
by selling its electricity in the wholesale market. The CfD is entered into between a renewable electricity
generator and the Low Carbon Contracts Company Limited, a limited company owned by the Government (the
“LCCC”), as CfD counterparty, under which payments are made by reference to a fixed price for each MWh of
electricity produced by the generator, known as the strike price. The generator sells the electricity in the
wholesale market outside the CfD. When a specified market reference wholesale electricity price (which, for a
baseload generator is calculated as the average market wholesale electricity price based on season-ahead prices)
is:

   - below the strike price, if the generator generates, the generator receives a top-up payment from the LCCC
for the difference between the market reference wholesale electricity price and the strike price;

   - above the strike price, if the generator generates, the generator must pay back to the LCCC the difference
between the market reference wholesale electricity price and the strike price.

Strike prices under a CfD are indexed for inflation (UK CPI). The LCCC is funded by electricity suppliers,
which pass the cost on to customers.

As a result, the generator has stability in respect of the price of the electricity that it generates from
renewable sources for the term of the CfD, normally expected to be 15 years. The Government intends that the
stabilisation of revenue under CfDs will increase the rate of investment and lower the cost of capital, thereby
reducing costs to customers.

CfDs are awarded through “allocation rounds”, each of which has a pre-determined budget for CfDs divided
into three “pots”, one each for established technologies, less-established technologies and biomass conversions,
respectively.

The first allocation round of CfDs concluded in February 2015 and resulted in the procurement of 2.1GW of
capacity at an annual cost of £315 million. The second allocation round of CfDs (Pot 2) concluded in September
2017 and resulted in 3.3GW of capacity at an annual cost of £176 million. Biomass conversion projects were not
eligible to bid in the second allocation round of CfDs. A third allocation round is planned for May 2019.

_Investment contracts_

To bridge the temporal gap between the RO Scheme and the awarding of CfDs under the CfD Regime, the
Government decided to issue an early form of CfDs called Investment Contracts pursuant to the FIDeR regime in
advance of the full implementation of the CfD Regime. Investment Contracts were introduced to avoid any major
hiatus in investment during the changes to the market under the Electricity Market Reform ahead of

143


-----

implementation of CfDs. Investment Contracts were awarded if the Government considered that, without the
Investment Contract, there was a significant risk that the electricity generation to which that Investment Contract
relates would not occur or would be significantly delayed.

In April 2014, DECC announced that eight renewable electricity projects received Investment Contracts,
with strike prices based on December 2013 strike prices. We received one of these Investment Contracts in
respect of our third biomass unit providing a visible earnings stream out to 2027.

_Capacity Market_

The Capacity Market is designed to help address concerns about the future security of electricity supply. In
Capacity Market auctions, participants bid for Capacity Market agreements under which they commit to generate
at times of system stress. Under a Capacity Market agreement, a generator is entitled to fixed monthly payments
which provide guaranteed revenue for the investors of generation plants. Generators are, however, subject to
penalties if they do not deliver energy during a system stress event, which occurs when the System Operator has
to resort to emergency actions in order to balance supply. A forecast of future demand is made four years in
advance. The net capacity required to meet a Government-set reliability standard will then be procured through a
Capacity Market auction.

Generation units which benefit from a CfD or an Investment Contract or which receive support under the
RO Scheme are not eligible to participate in the Capacity Market at the same time. Consequently, our biomass
units and Lanark hydro facility and approximately 28MW of capacity at our Galloway hydro facility are not
eligible for the Capacity Market, but the rest of our CCGT, Cruachan pumped storage and hydro power plants, as
well as our two remaining coal-fired units at Drax Power Station participated in the Capacity Market until its
suspension on 15 November 2018 (discussed below).

Capacity Market auctions are run under a descending clock format, starting with offers of £75/kW and
gradually reducing until the minimum price is reached at which the supply of capacity offered by bidders is equal
to the volume required. Capacity Market agreements at the clearing price are offered to those generators and
demand-side responders that were successful in the auction. The length of agreement can vary depending on the
nature of the project, with new plants being entitled to long-term agreements (15 years), to encourage investment
in new generation assets; refurbished plants being offered three-year agreements; and existing generators and
demand-side responders being offered one-year contracts. During the delivery year, capacity providers will
receive monthly payments for their agreed obligation at the auction clearing price. Providers are expected to be
available to respond with their agreed generation volumes or to reduce their demand when called on by the
System Operator at times of system stress.

The Government has acknowledged with respect to previous T-4 Capacity Market Auctions that clearing
prices were not sufficient to incentivise new electricity generating capacity to be built, in particular the inability
to secure proposals of new, large-scale, lower emission gas generation. In response, the Government has
proposed to introduce several changes to the Capacity Market. To reduce “speculative bids”, in 2016 the
Government doubled the level of credit cover per MW each bidder must have in place for the capacity it
proposes, and raised termination fees for plants that wished to exit the Capacity Market mechanism prior to the
end of its existing Capacity Market agreements. Furthermore, the System Operator revised upward its demand
target for the upcoming auctions, leading to the market anticipating higher capacity payments outturn.

The T-4 Capacity Market Auction in December 2016 secured 52.4GW of capacity for delivery in 20202021, at a clearing price of £22.50/kW (in 2015/2016 prices). Although higher than expected, consensus views
the clearing price as insufficient to trigger investments in new gas-fired generation. The first Capacity Market
agreements awarded in a T-4 Capacity Market Auction had been intended to begin in Winter 2018/19, but, citing
a need for additional security of supply in Winter 2017/18, the System Operator held a T-1 Capacity Market
Auction earlier than scheduled in January 2017 with the stated aim of procuring capacity for the immediately
following winter. This auction secured 54.4GW of capacity for delivery at a clearing price of £6.95/kW
(kilowatt). The T-1 Capacity Market Auction, which concluded in February 2018, secured a further 5.78GW of
capacity for delivery in Winter 2018/19 at a clearing price of £6.00/kW. The T-4 Capacity Market Auction in
February 2018 for delivery in 2021/2022 secured 50.4GW at a clearing price of £8.40/kW (in 2016/2017 prices),
representing a significant reduction on previous T-4 Capacity Market Auction clearing prices, and the T-1
Capacity Market Auction in February 2018 for delivery in 2018/2019 secured 5.8GW at a clearing price of
£6.00/KW (in 2018 prices). DBEIS has consulted on plans to hold a T-3 Capacity Market Auction for the
2022/23 delivery year to replace the T-4 Capacity Market Auction which had been scheduled for 2019.

On 15 November 2018, the General Court of the European Union issued a ruling annulling the European
Commission’s 2014 decision not to undertake a more detailed investigation of the Government’s scheme

establishing the Capacity Market (the “Capacity Market Ruling”). The Capacity Market Ruling imposed a
“standstill period” while the European Commission completes a further “phase two” state aid investigation into
the Capacity Market. In the wake of the Capacity Market Ruling, a separate judicial review proceeding has been
brought in the UK by an industry participant challenging actions taken by the Government in respect of the
Capacity Market during the standstill period. Payments to generators scheduled under existing Capacity Market
agreements and the holding of future Capacity Market auctions have been suspended. It is not possible to predict
with certainty the duration of the European Commission’s re-investigation. The duration of the current
suspension of payments and auctions is therefore uncertain; however, consistent with statements made by the
Government, we currently anticipate that the Capacity Market will be re-established on the same or similar terms
during 2019. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—The Capacity Market in the UK
_is currently suspended and its future is uncertain”._

DBEIS has indicated its intent, in a consultation document dated 19 December 2018, to work with the
European Commission to achieve a reinstatement of the Capacity Market as soon as possible and has confirmed
an intention to hold a replacement T-1 Capacity Market Auction in summer 2019, for delivery in 2019/20
(notwithstanding the current suspension of the Capacity Market). Furthermore, DBEIS has indicated that, upon
reinstatement, it expects to make back payments to generators who have complied with their Capacity Market
agreements during the standstill period. However, reinstatement remains conditional upon EU state aid reapproval.

The tables below summarise the terms of recent Capacity Market auctions conducted prior to the Capacity
Market Ruling.

_The Emissions Performance Standard_

The Energy Act 2013 introduced the EPS, which limits emissions from new fossil fuel power stations with
an electricity generating capacity above 50MW and received development consent after 18 February 2014. The
EPS will effectively ensure that no new coal-fired power stations may be developed, unless equipped with carbon
capture and storage (“CCS”) technology. CCS technology enables CO2 emissions from industrial plants to be
captured and stored permanently deep underground, thereby removing carbon emissions created by power
stations from the atmosphere.

The operator of any new fossil fuel plant at or over 50MW will have a total tonnage allowance of CO2
within which it must ensure that emissions from the plant remain. The EPS has initially been set at an annual
limit equivalent to 450g of CO2 per kWh for a baseload (continuously operating) generating plant. The limit is
intended to be reviewed every three years, but plants operating at that point will remain subject to that standard
until 2045.

The Energy Act 2013 and the Emissions Performance Standard Regulations 2015 also set out detailed
circumstances in which the EPS may be modified or suspended in order to maintain the UK’s security of supply,
and provide powers for an appropriate national authority to establish a monitoring and enforcement regime.

**OUR BUSINESS**

**Overview**

We are an innovative electricity generation and supply business with operations in the UK and the US
working to enable a zero-carbon, lower-cost energy future. Our business comprises three segments with an
integrated strategy where we source and produce fuel in the form of sustainable wood pellets, generate
electricity, and supply electricity, gas and services to end customers.

We are a power generator with generation sites across the UK with a total generation capacity of
approximately 6.5GW. Our generation portfolio consists of Drax Power Station and the generation assets of
DGEL, which we acquired through the DGEL Acquisition in December 2018. Drax Power Station is our single
largest generation asset and is comprised of our four biomass and two coal generation units and our remaining
generation assets comprise a diversified portfolio of pumped storage, hydro and gas generation assets. Our
generation assets are located in England and Scotland, and we have options to develop a further 6.6GW of
generation capacity in the UK.

We own and operate Drax Power Station which is the largest power plant in the UK by generation capacity
with an installed capacity of approximately 4.0GW. Drax Power Station is a critical part of the UK’s energy
infrastructure, generating approximately 5 per cent. of the UK’s total electricity, and approximately 12 per cent.
of the UK’s renewable electricity for the twelve months ended 31 December 2018. Based on the 2017-2018
compliance period, Drax Power Station is also the UK’s largest single-site generator of renewable energy. Drax
Power Station provides flexible and reliable generation and produced 18.3 TWh of electricity in 2018, of which
75 per cent. was generated from sustainable biomass, making us a core part of the UK’s decarbonisation strategy.
In August 2018, we completed the conversion of a fourth coal-fired generation unit at Drax Power Station to
biomass-fired generation at a cost of approximately £30 million (which was lower than the cost of converting
each of the previous three biomass-fired generation units). Our four biomass-fired generation units receive
regulatory support, leading to enhanced earnings streams with a significant component of stable and predictable
revenue extending to 2027. Our biomass-fired generation assets are served by an efficient and reliable biomass
supply chain comprising dedicated port handling infrastructure and rail paths, thereby enhancing security of
supply of fuel for our electricity generation activities. Currently, our two coal-fired generation units provide
important support services to the UK’s electricity system, including greater reliability and flexibility at times of
low De-rated Reserve Margins and system stress.

On 31 December 2018, we acquired ScottishPower’s multi-site, multi-technology 2.6GW portfolio of
pumped storage, hydro and gas-fired generation assets for £687 million (based on total consideration of
£702 million, less customary net debt and working capital adjustments), which we renamed Drax Generation
Enterprise Limited (“DGEL”). DGEL owns and operates the Cruachan pumped storage power plant, hydro
power plants at Galloway and Lanark and four CCGT power stations in Southern and Northern England. This
portfolio of generation assets significantly diversifies our generation capacity, expands our flexible, low-carbon
and renewable generation business model and increases our ability to provide system support services to the UK
energy system. Our acquisition of DGEL accelerates our development from a single-site generation business into
a multi-site, multi-technology national power generator.

We are further responding to the growth in intermittent renewable capacity on the electricity grid by
developing a pipeline of flexible power options, including options to develop up to four 299MW rapid-response
standalone OCGT projects and options to repower one or both of our remaining coal-fired generation units at
Drax Power Station to gas-fired generation with supporting battery storage technology. In addition, our newly
acquired Damhead Creek site benefits from an option for the development of a further CCGT asset, Damhead
Creek II, which would provide us with an additional 1.8GW of gas generation capacity. Each of these projects
has the potential to provide flexible and reliable electricity to the UK electricity system and further diversify our
future energy generation capability. However, each project is subject to a positive investment decision and would
require appropriate support through the Capacity Market. In November 2018, payments under the Capacity
Market were suspended following a ruling by the General Court of the European Union. We expect that this issue
will be resolved and that the Capacity Market will be re-established on the same or similar terms during 2019,
consistent with the position expressed by the Government. For further information on the Capacity Market, see
“Industry Overview—Overview of Electricity Market Reform—Capacity Market” and “Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to Our Business and Industry—The Capacity Market in the UK is currently suspended and its future is_
_uncertain”._

Our B2B Energy Supply segment, comprising Haven Power and Opus, is the fifth largest supplier of
electricity to businesses in the UK by volume supplied as of 31 October 2018 and the largest provider of
renewable energy to businesses. As of 31 December 2018, we supplied over 396,000 electricity and gas meters

146


-----

and, in 2018, we supplied 20.9 TWh of electricity and gas. Our B2B Energy Supply segment had an 11 per cent.
share of the B2B electricity market as at 31 October 2018 and provides us with a direct route to market for much
of the electricity we generate. We believe that B2B counterparties place fewer credit restrictions on us than
wholesale market counterparties and selling to this market provides us with a more diversified counterparty base
with less concentrated counterparty credit risk.

We produce compressed wood pellets from sustainable sources in three plants in the southern US and use
those pellets as fuel for our biomass-fired generation, which provided 18.0 per cent. of our biomass need in the
year ended 31 December 2018. Following the successful commissioning in 2018 of our third wood pellet
manufacturing facility, our LaSalle facility located in Urania, Louisiana, all three of our wood pellet
manufacturing facilities have the capability to manufacture wood pellets at their nameplate capacity. We
produced 1.35 million tonnes of wood pellets in 2018 representing a 64 per cent. increase on production in 2017
and are increasing capacity at our LaSalle and Morehouse facilities by 175,000 tonnes in aggregate by 2021
(which would represent a 13 per cent. increase on our current production capacity when the incremental capacity,
is fully commissioned), which we anticipate will incur a small fraction of the equivalent cost of building a new
pellet production plant. In addition to self-supply from our manufacturing facilities, we have a network of third
party suppliers of wood pellets and to this end we have entered into long-term contracts with other wood pellet
suppliers in North America and Europe to support a long-term, stable supply of biomass.

Drax Group plc is listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange under stock ticker “DRX”, and
is part of the FTSE 250 Index. Drax Group plc’s market capitalisation as at 25 April 2019 was approximately
£1,366.7 million. As at 31 December 2018, our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA was £249.6 million at market
close and our consolidated net debt as at 31 December 2018 was £319.1 million (noting that if our US dollar
balances relating to the Initial Notes are translated at the hedged rate, rather than the rate prevailing at
31 December 2018, our net debt would have been reduced by £22.0 million). We acquired DGEL on
31 December 2018 and paid the initial consideration due to the vendor on 2 January 2019 using a combination of
£550 million drawn under the 2018 Bridge Facility and £137 million of cash reserves. Accordingly, no profit or
loss has been recognised in respect of DGEL in 2018, and neither the drawing under the 2018 Bridge Facility nor
the reduction in cash in respect of the consideration paid are reflected in our consolidated net debt as at
31 December 2018. Pro forma for the Transactions, our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended
31 December 2018 was £326.8 million and our consolidated net debt as at 31 December 2018 was £1,023.6
million. See “Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data” and “Presentation of Financial
_Information and Other Information”._

The three segments of our business are:

   - Power Generation: Through our Power Generation segment, we play a significant role in providing
reliable, renewable baseload electricity generation capacity as well as important system support services,
enhancing the security of the UK’s electricity supply and supporting the UK’s transition to a low-carbon
future. Following the DGEL Acquisition, Drax is the third largest generator in the UK when taking
account of anticipated output (as published by the System Operator):

In 2018, Drax Power Station generated approximately 5 per cent. of the UK’s electricity needs and its
four sustainable biomass-fired generation units generated approximately 12 per cent. of the UK’s
renewable electricity. In 2017 and 2018, approximately 65 per cent. and 75 per cent., respectively, of
electricity generated by Drax Power Station was from sustainable biomass rather than coal. In 2018, less
than 6 per cent. of our revenue was attributable to sales of electricity generated by our coal-fired
generation units at Drax Power Station. All six generation units at Drax Power Station are the largest in
their class in the UK. Each generation unit can be operated flexibility and independently.

Drax Power Station benefits from regulatory support via the index-linked CfD and RO regimes which
provide Drax Power Station with financial support to facilitate the production of electricity. Following the
conversion of our fourth coal-fired generation unit at Drax Power Station to biomass-fired generation in
August 2018, we are able to optimise our generation in a way that maximises the revenue associated with
generating the ROCs available to Drax Power Station as a whole under the RO Scheme. Under the current
RO Scheme, three of our generation units converted to biomass are eligible to receive ROCs until March
2027. For further information on the RO Scheme and the CfD Regime, see “Industry Overview—
_Overview of the Electricity Market Reform—Contracts for Difference” and “Industry Overview—UK_
_Clean Energy Legislation—The Renewables Obligation”._

On 31 December 2018, we acquired DGEL, ScottishPower’s 2.6GW portfolio of pumped storage, hydro
and gas-fired generation assets. DGEL includes the Cruachan pumped storage power plant, hydro power

147


-----

plants at Galloway and Lanark and four CCGT power stations in Southern and Northern England.
Cruachan provides over 35 per cent. of the UK’s pumped-storage capacity and is capable of generating
440MW of large-scale storage and flexible electricity continuously for 16 hours. It also provides
contracted Ancillary Services to the UK electricity system and important system support services through
the balancing market, in addition to merchant power generation. The Galloway and Lanark hydro power
plants are capable of generating up to a combined 126MW of stable renewable electricity. Lanark
(17MW) receives regulatory support from the RO Scheme, and Galloway (109MW) receives regulatory
support from the RO Scheme with respect to approximately 28MW of its generating capacity, in addition
to which it operates a reservoir and dam system providing power storage capabilities and opportunities
for peaking and system support services. Our CCGT power stations at Damhead Creek (805MW), Rye
House (715MW), Shoreham (420MW) and Blackburn Mill (60MW) provide baseload and peak power
generation, in addition to other system support services. The multi-site, multi-technology nature of this
2.6GW portfolio of generation assets significantly diversifies our generation capacity, expands our
flexible, low-carbon and renewable generation model and increases our ability to provide system support
services to the UK energy system. The System Operator has a growing need for system support services
and we have a number of contracts in place with the System Operator to supply such services.

Furthermore, we are progressing the development of options for four new 299MW OCGT plants in
England and Wales. As part of the DGEL Acquisition, the Group also acquired a permitted option for the
development of a 1.8GW CCGT plant at Damhead Creek (Damhead Creek II). Each of these plants has
the potential to provide flexible and reliable electricity to the UK electricity system and diversify our
future energy generation capability subject to a positive investment decision and appropriate support
through the Capacity Market (if and when re-established). If commissioned, each of these plants would
provide fast, flexible gas generation to support the UK electricity system at times of peak demand.

We are also developing options to repower one or both of our remaining coal-fired generation units to gas
and build supporting battery storage at Drax Power Station. The project could replace the existing
c.1.3GW of coal-fired generation capacity with up to 3.6GW of gas generation capacity (capable of
running in either open cycle and combined cycle modes) and up to 200MW of supporting battery storage,
subject to a positive investment decision, obtaining consent and other approvals and the award of one or
more 15-year Capacity Market agreements or similar support in future Capacity Market auctions subject
to the Capacity Market being re-established.

- B2B Energy Supply: We supply electricity to businesses through Haven Power and electricity and gas to
businesses through Opus. Both Haven Power and Opus provide us with a credit-efficient route to market
for a proportion of the electricity we generate and the ROCs that our Power Generation segment earns.
The majority of Haven Power’s sales volumes are with larger I&C customers, while Opus is focused on
SMEs. Our B2B Energy Supply segment is the fifth largest supplier of electricity to businesses in the UK
by volume supplied as of 31 October 2018 and the largest provider of renewable energy to businesses. In
2018 we supplied 17.9 TWh of electricity, representing an 11 per cent. share of the B2B electricity
market.

- Pellet Production: Through our Pellet Production segment based in the US Gulf region, we manufacture
and supply compressed wood pellets from sustainably managed forests. We take low-grade wood and
residues from other wood processing and forestry industries and transform them into pellets that can be
transported cost-effectively to Drax Power Station to generate low-carbon energy. We operate three wood
pellet manufacturing facilities in the US Gulf region: Amite BioEnergy in Gloster, Mississippi,
Morehouse BioEnergy in Bastrop, Louisiana and LaSalle BioEnergy in Urania, Louisiana. In 2018, our
wood pellet manufacturing facilities produced approximately 1,351,000 tonnes of sustainable biomass,
representing 18.0 per cent. of our internal requirements for generation from sustainable biomass,
compared to production of approximately 822,000 tonnes being 12.3 per cent. of our internal
requirements in 2017. This increase was driven by the successful commissioning of our LaSalle facility
which has annual nameplate production capacity of 450,000 tonnes and achieved full production ahead of
schedules in 2018, an increase in annual production capacity of 75,000 tonnes at each of our Amite and
Morehouse facilities in 2017. This nameplate capacity of 1,500,000 tonnes gives us the capability to
supply a greater share of our internal requirements for generation from sustainable biomass in 2019. We
aim to increase the share of internally sourced pellets to up to 30 per cent. in the future, as part of our
broader initiative to reduce operating costs by leveraging the vertically integrated nature of our
operations. To that end, we are increasing capacity at our LaSalle and Morehouse facilities by 175,000
tonnes in aggregate by 2021. All three of our wood pellet manufacturing facilities are certified under the

148


-----

Sustainable Biomass Program, an industry standard, demonstrating that their biomass is legally and
sustainably sourced. We operate a 2,700,000 tonne port facility in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, which
includes two 40,000 tonne storage domes to transport pellets from our own manufacturing facilities and
from approved third party suppliers to the UK for use by our Power Generation segment. The port facility
can load more than 15,000 tonnes of pellets per day and can accommodate 60,000 tonne Panamax
Vessels. In 2018, we also started construction of a new rail spur linking our LaSalle facility to the
regional rail network and our port facility at Baton Rouge, which will increase transportation efficiency
and economies of scale and reduce the cost and carbon footprint of our operations.

**Our History**

Drax Power Station was originally built, owned and operated by the Central Electricity Generating Board
and was constructed in two phases, with the first three electricity generation units installed by 1974 and the
second three units installed by 1986. In 1988, flue-gas desulphurisation (“FGD”) equipment was fitted to all six
units, enabling Drax Power Station to operate within sulphur dioxide (“SO2”) emissions restrictions.

Drax Power Station was transferred to National Power as part of the structuring and privatisation of the UK
electricity supply industry under the Electricity Act 1989. In 1999, National Power sold Drax Power Station to
AES Corporation, which financed the acquisition partly with bank debt.

In 2003, we underwent a restructuring, with AES Corporation withdrawing from its ownership position. The
creditors voted to retain their interest and the final restructuring proposal was implemented in December 2003,
with Drax Group Limited as the ultimate holding company and our creditors as owners of Drax Group Limited.

In 2005, we completed a refinancing and Drax Group plc’s ordinary shares were listed and admitted to
trading on the London Stock Exchange on 15 December 2005.

In 2009, we acquired Ipswich-based Haven Power, which was launched in 2006 specifically to serve the
electricity needs of SME customers and to provide an alternative to the large multinational electricity suppliers.
Since 2009, Haven Power has grown its SME business and established a business in the large I&C sector.

In 2015, we commissioned two wood pellet manufacturing facilities in the US Gulf region as well as the
port facility in Baton Rouge, Louisiana required to load and ship wood pellets to Drax Power Station.

In December 2016, we acquired four OCGT projects, comprising sites at Eye (Suffolk), Hirwaun (South
Wales), Millbrook (Bedfordshire) and Abergelli (Swansea).

In February 2017, we acquired Opus, a UK business-to-business supplier of electricity and gas which is
focused on the SME market.

In April 2017, we acquired a third wood pellet manufacturing facility in Urania, Louisiana.

In December 2018, we acquired ScottishPower’s 2.6GW portfolio of pumped storage, hydro and gas-fired
generation assets located in Scotland and England, accelerating our development from a single-site generation
business into a multi-site, multi-technology national electricity generator.

**_Transition from Coal-fired Generation_**

_Conversion to Sustainable Biomass_

Since 2012, we have transformed Drax Power Station into a predominantly biomass-fuelled generator,
having converted four of our six generation units to burn sustainable biomass instead of coal. The first of Drax
Power Station’s six generation units was converted to run on sustainable biomass in April 2013 with support
under the RO Scheme. The second unit was fully converted to sustainable biomass in October 2014 (with support
under the RO Scheme). A third unit, fully converted to generate using sustainable biomass on 21 December 2016
under the CfD Regime after the European Commission granted state aid approval of our CfD for this unit
conversion.

In August 2018, we completed the conversion of a fourth coal-fired generation unit at Drax Power Station to
biomass-fired generation at a cost of approximately £30 million (which was lower than the cost of converting
each of the previous three biomass-fired generation units).

We receive one ROC per MWh of electricity generated from those units that are supported by the RO
Scheme. In July 2018, the Renewables Obligation (Amendment) Order 2018 came into force, establishing an
annual ROC cap at the power station level across all RO accredited biomass-fired generation units equal

149


-----

to DBEIS’s estimate of the number of ROCs to be received by each grandfathered biomass-fired unit (the first
and second converted units at Drax Power Station) plus 125,000 ROCs for each non-grandfathered unit (the
fourth converted unit at Drax Power Station). Though we may not always reach the annual station-level ROC
cap, the conversion of this fourth generation unit to biomass gives us the flexibility to optimise our generation
across all RO-accredited units at Drax Power Station in a way that maximises the number of ROCs we receive
within the aggregate cap providing valuable operating redundancy. For example if output from either of the first
two converted units at Drax Power Station were to be lower than DBEIS’s estimated output (for example due to
an outage, any issues with the biomass supply chain or market conditions), we could increase electricity
generation under the fourth converted unit in excess of 125,000 MWh to make up for such shortfall. Our third
converted biomass-fired generation unit benefits from the CfD Regime, under which payments are made to us, or
we make payments, by reference to a fixed price for each MWh of electricity produced, known as the strike
price. As a result, we have certainty in respect of the price of the electricity that we generate from that unit for the
term of the CfD. For further information on the RO Scheme and the CfD Regime, see “Industry Overview—UK
_Clean Energy Legislation—The Renewables Obligation” and “Industry Overview—Overview of Electricity_
_Market Reform—Contracts for Difference”._

In April 2018, we joined the Powering Past Coal Alliance, to support the Government in promoting reduced
coal use globally. The Powering Past Coal Alliance is a UK-Canadian initiative which seeks to end the use of
coal by 2030 in developed countries.

_Acquisition and Development of Other Non-Coal Generating Assets_

Since 2016, we have been diversifying our portfolio of generation assets, with the aim of expanding our
generation capacity in order to become a multi-site, multi-technology national power operator.

In December 2016, we acquired four OCGT projects, comprising sites at Eye (Suffolk), Hirwaun (South
Wales), Millbrook (Bedfordshire) and Abergelli (Swansea). Each of these plants has the potential to provide
flexible and reliable electricity to the UK electricity system and diversify our future energy generation capability
subject to a positive investment decision and appropriate support through the Capacity Market, if and when reestablished.

In December 2018, we acquired ScottishPower’s 2.6GW portfolio of pumped storage, hydro and gas-fired
generation assets located across Scotland, Northern England and Southern England. The acquisition of these
generation assets has further extended and broadened our generation capacity and capability, expanding our
flexible, low-carbon and renewable generation model and increases our ability to provide system support services
to the UK energy system. Our Cruachan pumped storage power plant and CCGT power stations increase our
capability to provide more of the flexibility increasingly required by the UK energy system to enable higher level
of intermittent renewable generation while delivering higher-quality contract-based revenues, and accelerated our
development from a single-site generation business into a diversified national power generator.

Furthermore, we are developing options to repower one or both of our remaining coal-fired generation units
to gas and build supporting battery storage at Drax Power Station. This project could replace the existing
c.1.3GW of coal-fired generation capacity with up to 3.6GW of gas generation capacity (capable of running in
either open cycle and combined cycle modes) and up to 200MW of supporting battery storage, subject to a
positive investment decision and appropriate support through the Capacity Market, if and when re-established.
This repowering and storage project would further enhance our flexible generation capacity and complete our
transition away from coal generation entirely.

In addition, our newly acquired Damhead Creek site benefits from an option for the development of a
further CCGT asset, Damhead Creek II, which would provide us with an additional 1.8GW of gas generation
capacity. This project has the potential to provide flexible and reliable electricity to the UK electricity system and
further diversify our future energy generation capability, however it is subject to a positive investment decision
and would require appropriate support through the Capacity Market, if and when re-established.

**Strengths**

**_We are a critical part of the UK’s energy infrastructure._**

We are a nationally critical low-carbon energy group and a fundamental part of the UK’s energy
infrastructure. Our current portfolio of generation assets (including those acquired in the DGEL Acquisition)
produced approximately 7 per cent. of the UK’s electricity requirements in 2018 (compared to the UK’s average
De-Rated Reserve Margin for the last five years of 7.4 per cent.), demonstrating that we are a critical participant
in the overall UK energy landscape.

In 2018, our current portfolio of generation assets, taking into account our acquisition of ScottishPower’s
portfolio of pumped storage, hydro and gas-fired generation assets on 31 December 2018, produced
approximately 13 per cent. of the UK’s renewable electricity.

Our primary generation facility, Drax Power Station, is the largest power station in the UK by generation
capacity, with approximately 4.0GW of installed capacity primarily from four biomass-fired units and two coalfired units. Through our biomass-fired generation units, Drax Power Station is also the largest single-site

151


-----

renewable energy generation asset in the UK. Our generation units at Drax Power Station are also the most
efficient units in their class in the UK, enabling them to run profitably at times when others cannot. Each of the
generation units at Drax Power Station can be operated independently and has the flexibility to generate
electricity at varying levels of output, enabling these generation units to provide a range of generation and system
support services to the electricity network.

Our acquisition of ScottishPower’s 2.6GW portfolio of pumped storage, hydro and gas-fired generation
assets has further extended and diversified our generation capacity and capability, expanding our flexible, lowcarbon and renewable generation model and increasing our ability to provide system support services to the UK
energy system. Following the DGEL Acquisition, Drax is the third largest generator in the UK when taking
account of anticipated output (as published by the System Operator). Our pumped storage, hydro and CCGT
assets increase our capability to provide the flexibility increasingly required by the UK energy system to enable
higher levels of intermittent renewable generation in the UK energy market while delivering contract-based
revenues.

**_We are a key player in the UK’s transition to a lower carbon economy._**

The UK electricity market has been experiencing a period of significant structural change. In the last
decade, there has been an increase in inflexible, renewable generation technology, combined with the closure of
significant volumes of thermal plant which historically have been able to provide the grid with a combination of
both baseload and flexible generation. We are strategically placed to fill this gap and support this longer-term
transition to a low-carbon, lower-cost UK electricity system through our portfolio of lower-carbon and renewable
generation assets, and in particular our ability to provide up to 2.5GW of reliable baseload generation via our
four biomass units at Drax Power Station after converting these units from coal in anticipation of coal generation
being phased out in the UK.

Looking forward, as the UK is expected to phase out coal-fired generation by 2025, gas-fired generation
will be the key transitional generation technology in addition to biomass generation that enables and supports this
long-term transition. As part of this transition, we are developing a pipeline of options, which could include
repowering the remaining two coal-fired generation units at Drax Power Station to gas, leveraging expertise from
prior conversions and using existing infrastructure at Drax Power Station. If developed, each repowered unit will
deliver stable, contract-based earnings and extend the operating life of Drax Power Station through the late
2030s, whilst each providing 1.8GW of generation capacity. Our pipeline of options also includes further gas
generation opportunities ranging from the development of up to four 299MW rapid-response OCGT projects to
developing our Damhead Creek II site into a 1.8GW CCGT plant. These options and the development
opportunities they represent will ensure that we continue to play a key role in the UK’s transition to a lower
carbon economy. See “Business—Principal Activities and Markets—Power Generation—Gas development
_projects”._

**_We are a leading provider of system support services to the UK electricity system._**

The transformation of the UK electricity market set out above will also result in an increased need for
system support services to be provided the UK electricity grid. Our recent acquisition of DGEL further improves
our position to take advantage of these changing dynamics.

Between 2012 and 2018, 20GW of flexible, thermal generation capacity was decommissioned and replaced
by more than 30GW of intermittent renewable generation. This trend is expected to increase and the UK has a
stated target to increase the proportion of its electricity generation from wind to 30 per cent. by 2030 and a wider
commitment to reducing carbon emissions by 80 per cent. by 2050 (compared to 1990 levels).

However, intermittent renewable generation is dependent on favourable weather conditions and so is less
able to respond to fluctuations in electricity demand. For example, recent extreme weather events (for example,
changes in the behaviour of the polar vortex) and corresponding peaks in demand in recent years have
demonstrated the limitations of intermittent generation. In Winter 2016/2017 and Winter 2017/2018, the UK and
Europe experienced extended periods of very low temperatures coupled with little to no wind, putting strain on
UK and European system infrastructure and leading to elevated electricity prices generally and large spikes in the
electricity price during certain periods.

To achieve the UK’s 2050 commitment and support the increase in intermittent wind and solar generation
there will be a need for complementary flexible generation assets that can provide system support services and
alter their generation profiles at any point in time to support the changing levels of intermittent generation. The
flexible, responsive and reliable characteristics of our biomass, gas, hydro and pumped storage generation assets

152


-----

allow us to meet the continually increasing need for system support services arising from the increase in
intermittent generation in the system both generally and at times of system strain, and play an important role in
the UK’s security of energy supply. The reduction in thermal generation capacity in the UK outlined above
means that there are fewer operators and plants available for the long term to provide such services, and even
fewer who can do so in a low carbon way that we are able to offer through our biomass units, hydro and pumped
storage assets.

Our pipeline of gas generation options will, if developed, enable us to provide additional system support
services further strengthens our position as a leading provider of such services. In addition, these options will be
able to provide various Ancillary Services and deliver further flexible generation in support of the UK electricity
system.

**_Our earnings benefit from a high degree of stability and visibility._**

Our earnings have a high degree of stability and visibility as a result of:

   - earnings from our biomass-fired generation units under the CfD Regime and RO Scheme (see below), the
latter of which allows us to flexibly optimise our generation across our RO-accredited units, reducing our
operational risk;

   - Capacity Market payments and Ancillary Services contracts for a range of our generation assets;

   - a naturally hedged portfolio of generation assets and businesses through the value chain;

   - a robust hedging policy; and

   - retail margins.

We expect our Adjusted EBITDA to continue to be derived predominantly from non-commodity exposed
sources of earnings in the future. As a consequence of this, the volatility of our earnings which characterised our
cash flows in previous years should be substantially reduced. We now have long-term visibility of our cash
flows, underpinned by a more diverse generation portfolio and operational flexibility.

_Long-term contracted Government revenues_

Generation from Drax Power Station’s existing biomass generation units benefits from a UK legislative and
contractual framework designed to support renewable energy sources. One of our biomass-fired generation units
receives support through the CfD Regime, while our other three biomass-fired generation units are supported
under the RO Scheme. Our support under both regimes extends to 2027. As a renewable fuel, biomass is exempt
from the EU ETS and Carbon Price Support.

Our CfD is a private law contract between Drax Power and a Government-owned entity, the Low Carbon
Contracts Company Limited. Under our CfD we are paid any shortfall, and repay any excess, between a strike
price and a market reference price calculated as the average market price for electricity in the UK market over a
given period. Our CfD is indexed to the UK consumer price index and extends to March 2027. It provides an
effective hedge against the electricity price at current market prices and thereby supports earnings stability and
visibility for our business.

The RO Scheme, established in 2002 to encourage the development of large-scale renewable electricity
capacity in the UK, places an obligation on licensed electricity suppliers either to source a proportion of the
electricity they provide to customers from eligible renewable sources or to make a payment equal to the buy-out
price. The buy-out price increases in line with UK retail price index each year. The sourcing of renewable energy
is demonstrated by the supplier presenting ROCs (equivalent in number to the supplier’s individual obligation) to
the administrator of the RO Scheme, Ofgem. ROCs are issued by Ofgem to renewable generators for each MWh
of renewable electricity generated in different proportions based on the type of technology used. Electricity
suppliers can source ROCs from renewable electricity generators. ROCs are tradable certificates with no fixed
price and therefore the amount an electricity supplier pays for a ROC is a matter for negotiation between the
supplier and generator. As a result of the RO Scheme, our Power Generation segment receives ROCs that, as a
vertically-integrated renewable energy generator, we can use in our B2B Energy Supply segment or sell to third
parties. A proportion of the underlying electricity produced by our ROC-accredited units is sold on a forward
basis in order to improve the stability and visibility of our cash flows.

We currently receive one ROC for each MWh of generation from three of our biomass-fired generation
units, on top of the purchase price for the sale of electricity produced. ROC support for two of these units is

153


-----

grandfathered by the Government at the level of one ROC for each MWh of generation until March 2027. Our
most recently converted biomass-fired generation unit does not benefit from grandfathering but is still eligible to
receive ROCs until March 2027. See “Industry Overview—UK Clean Energy Legislation—Grandfathering of
_support under the Renewables Obligation”._

The RO Scheme was changed in July 2018, enabling us to optimise generation across the RO-accredited
generation units of Drax Power Station (whether grandfathered or not) subject to an overall cap at the power
station level (see “Industry Overview—UK clean energy legislation—Grandfathering of support under the
_Renewables Obligation”). The flexibility afforded by the cap mitigates operational risks across our biomass-fired_
generation units, allowing us to increase generation in one unit to cater for unplanned outages in another, thereby
enabling us to deliver a more consistent earnings profile from biomass generation.

Our hydro facilities also receive support under the RO Scheme. We receive one ROC for each MWh of
generation at our Lanark hydro facility, and our Galloway hydro facility receives regulatory support from the RO
Scheme with respect to approximately 28MW of its 109MW generating capacity at a rate of one ROC for each
MWh of generation.

_Generation Capacity and System Support_

With increasing levels of intermittent generation, we are continuing to indentify opportunities to create value
from our ability to flexibly operate our generation assets according to prevailing market conditions, such as shortterm power and balancing market activity, the provision of Ancillary Services and the use of out-of-specification
fuels in our coal-fired generation assets. Our acquisition of ScottishPower’s 2.6GW portfolio of pumped storage,
hydro and gas-fired generation assets has further extended and diversified our flexibility of generation and ability to
provide Ancillary Services to support the UK electricity system. To capture value in this market we focus resources
on optimising availability and flexibility of our coal, biomass, gas, hydro and pumped storage generation assets.

The System Operator is required to balance supply and demand and to ensure the secure and stable operation
of the Transmission System. In addition to its operation of the Balancing Mechanism, it routinely contracts with
generators to provide system support services. We are able to provide Ancillary Services to the System Operator,
such as “frequency response” (altering output to ensure the frequency of electricity in the Transmission System is
within statutory limits) and “reactive power” (enabling the System Operator to manage the voltage profile of the
Transmission System within certain parameters) services and our newly-acquired assets extend the range of services
we can offer (such as Spin Gen from our Cruachan pumped storage power plant, which enables generation to
commence at short notice if required by the System Operator). We have a diverse portfolio of biomass, gas, pumped
storage and hydro generation units which are located across the UK that means we are well placed to offer a range
of Ancillary Services. We believe that the size and flexible characteristics of the generation assets we currently
operate are well suited to offer these services, providing an opportunity for further contract-based revenues. In
addition, we are developing a pipeline of options which would be well suited to provide these Ancillary Services to
further support the UK electricity system. These options include the repowering of the remaining two coal-fired
generation units at Drax Power Station to gas which, if both developed, would increase the installed capacity of
Drax Power Station to approximately 6.5GW; the development of up to four 299MW rapid-response OCGT
projects; and the opportunity to develop our Damhead Creek II site into a 1.8GW CCGT plant, each of which
options would also improve our ability to provide many of these services.

The UK has established a Capacity Market system to support security and reliability of supply for the end
consumer. The Capacity Market guarantees selected generators a fixed price for maintaining a specified generation
capacity for a given period of time through an auction system. Generators receive either a one-year Capacity Market
agreement or 15-year Capacity Market agreement depending on whether they are entering the auction for existing or
potential new plants, respectively. Existing plants requiring significant refurbishment may also be eligible for threeyear Capacity Market agreements. In November 2018, the General Court of the European Union imposed a
“standstill period” in respect of the Capacity Market while the European Commission completes a full “phase two”
state aid investigation into the Capacity Market. Payments to generators under existing Capacity Market agreements
and the holding of future capacity auctions have been suspended. Although there is no guarantee that the Capacity
Market will be reinstated, we expect that the Capacity Market will be re-established on the same or similar terms in
2019, consistent with the position expressed by the UK Government. However, in the event that it is not, the DGEL
Acquisition Agreement includes a risk-sharing mechanism whereby if any contracted Capacity Market payments for
the period from 1 January to 30 September 2019 are not received in respect of the DGEL Assets, then a further
payment of up to £26 million would be made by either us to the previous shareholder of DGEL or vice-versa,
depending on DGEL’s 2019 gross profit. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—The
_Capacity Market in the UK is currently suspended and its future is uncertain” and “Summary—DGEL Acquisition”._

154


-----

Subject to reinstatement of the Capacity Market, we also expect to be able to participate in future Capacity
Market auctions based on the capacity of our CCGT power stations, the Cruachan pumped storage power plant,
the Galloway hydro power plant and our coal units at Drax Power Station. We currently have index-linked
Capacity Market agreements for our two coal-fired generation units and the three small ancillary gas turbines
located at Drax Power Station, which are expected to result in contract-based revenues of approximately
£83 million between October 2018 to 30 September 2022 in aggregate, and similar agreements for certain of our
pumped storage, hydro and CCGT assets acquired in connection with the DGEL Acquisition, which are expected
to result in contract-based revenues in excess of £156 million in aggregate between October 2018 to
30 September 2022, in each case, subject to the re-establishment of the Capacity Market. To the extent that our
coal-fired generation units are converted to gas-fired generation, we expect that any conversion will only take
effect after our obligations under existing Capacity Market agreements (which currently run to 30 September
2022) have been fulfilled.

_A naturally hedged portfolio of generation assets and businesses through the value chain_

The DGEL Acquisition accelerated our development from a single-site generation business into a multi-site,
multi-technology operator. Our ability to generate using a range of different technologies with different dispatch
economics and provide a range of Ancillary Services means we are less exposed to risks inherent to single
technologies and movements in individual commodity prices. For example, at a generation level, a fall in gas
prices, which would typically cause wholesale electricity prices to decrease and reduce margins for our
generation from biomass, could be mitigated by an increase in gas-fired generation.

At an operational level, we trade our generation assets as a single portfolio, leveraging our established
expertise to optimise the running of our assets to maximise returns.

We operate an integrated value chain across our three core segments enabling us to optimise the timing and
delivery of pellets produced to meet our biomass generation requirements at Drax Power Station and in turn our
Generation Segment provides low-carbon and renewable electricity to our B2B Supply Segment for onward
supply to customers.

_Hedging policy_

The earnings of our Power Generation segment are further supported by our robust hedging policy under
which we sell electricity generated up to two years ahead. This allows us to secure a margin on such electricity at
times when bark spreads, clean spark spreads or dark green spreads are attractive, thereby increasing visibility
with respect to our future Power Generation segment earnings. As of 20 February 2019, we had contracted fixed
price power sales (including both forward sold electricity and gas proxy hedges) of approximately 16.3 TWh, 8.9
TWh and 3.4 TWh for delivery in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.

Our business is subject to risks due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, in particular, the weakening
of sterling relative to other operational currencies. Most of the biomass we purchase is priced in US dollars,
Canadian dollars or euro. We operate a robust hedging policy with a five-year hedging period to manage the risk
of a change in the relative values of the US dollar, Canadian dollar or euro, or relative to other currencies
(including the pound sterling), which may increase our suppliers’ cost of business and ultimately our cost of
goods sold with respect to biomass.

_Retail_

Opus enjoys good customer retention levels and the potential for further growth, for example by allowing
our Group to provide a dual fuel offering, while Haven Power is well established in the I&C market and is
seeking to increase its number of SME customers. Our B2B Energy Supply segment provides a broad offering in
the SME market, which is generally characterised by higher gross margins per MWh compared to the I&C
market. Our B2B Energy Supply segment provides a direct route into the market for a significant amount of the
electricity we generate and a significant proportion of the ROCs issued to us.

_Increased control over fuel input costs via an integrated biomass supply chain_

Our wood pellet manufacturing facilities have a combined annual nameplate capacity of 1,500,000 tonnes,
comprising capacity of 525,000 tonnes at each of our Amite and Morehouse facilities and 450,000 tonnes of
capacity at our LaSalle facility, which was fully commissioned ahead of schedule in 2018. Our US port facility in
Baton Rouge, Louisiana has an annual export capacity of 2,100,000 tonnes (with the scope to expand further to
3,000,000 tonnes) and exceeds our current self-supply, enabling us to consolidate supply from third parties to
drive further supply chain efficiencies. Our US operations are strategically located near one another for
operational efficiencies, including optimising the time and cost of wood pellet deliveries to our Baton Rouge port
facility.

In 2018, our wood pellet manufacturing facilities produced approximately 1,351,000 tonnes of wood pellets
and our US port facility shipped 1,582,000 tonnes of wood pellets to Drax Power Station. In 2018, wood pellets
manufactured at our own facilities accounted for 18.0 per cent. of the biomass used at Drax Power Station
(compared with 12.3 per cent. of self-supply in 2017 and 7.7 per cent. in 2016) with the balance sourced from
third party suppliers based in North America and Europe under a series of predominantly long-term contracts
from sources also certified as sustainable. We aim to increase the share of internally sourced pellets to up to
30 per cent. in the future. To further this aim, we are developing options to increase capacity at our LaSalle and
Morehouse facilities by 175,000 tonnes in aggregate by 2021.

Our ability to source an increasing proportion of our biomass requirements internally via self-supply allows
us to better manage the quality of feedstock and the timing of deliveries. This enables us to optimise generation
and reduce the risk of fuel shortages and supply chain issues curtailing generation from Drax Power Station and
to better ensure a stable cost of biomass, thus reducing exposure to commodity price fluctuations. At the same
time, we maintain the flexibility to participate in the biomass spot market when prices are attractive.

Our exposure to commodity prices is managed through a commercial hedging strategy, which seeks to enter
into forward sales of electricity and purchases of associated fuel and the carbon emissions allowances.
Additionally, to manage currency risks associated with our biomass purchase contracts, which are mainly in US
dollars, we actively hedge our position through a rolling five-year hedging strategy.

**_Strong financial metrics and conservative financial policies._**

We have a conservative financial policy and have maintained a low leverage since we listed on the London
Stock Exchange in December 2005.

Our reported net leverage at the end of the last three calendar years has been between 0.7x and 1.6x. After
the completion of the Opus Acquisition in February 2017, our consolidated pro forma net leverage as at
31 December 2016 only increased to 2.7x, decreasing to 1.6x by 31 December 2019; after the completion of the
DGEL Acquisition in December 2018, our consolidated pro forma net leverage as at 31 December 2018 was
3.1x, albeit we are targeting a reduction in net leverage to 2.0x by 31 December 2019. See “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Significant Factors affecting Results_
_of Operations” for a discussion of factors affecting comparability of 2016, 2017 and 2018. We are committed to_
maintaining leverage at a level that is consistent with our current crossover credit rating, which supports our
trading strategy.

We have a strong cash conversion profile with an average annual operating cash conversion for the last three
calendar years of over 133 per cent., reflecting our excellent financial discipline and ongoing low maintenance
capital expenditure requirements.

We announced a new dividend policy in June 2017, which will pay a sustainable and growing dividend
consistent with our commitment to a strong balance sheet and our ambitions for growth.

We are focused on targeted selective investments which we expect to help us to continue to diversify our
earnings and cash flow sources within the framework of our conservative financial policy.

In addition to capital expenditure to secure operational performance, we expect our future maintenance
capital expenditures to include investments to upgrade our facilities to, among other things, comply with
applicable regulatory regimes, which we expect to translate into greater operating cash flow going forward. See
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Capital and
_Operating Expenditure”._

We have robust credit policies in place to limit the amount of concentration risk we have with any
counterparty (noting that the counterparty’s appetite to trade with us is itself based on its assessment of our credit

156


-----

profile). Sales to the B2B Energy Supply segment (as opposed to third parties) further reduce our concentration
risk by spreading the Power Generation segment’s exposure to third-party credit risk across a wider customer
base.

**_Our proven pioneering management team has led our business through an evolving regulatory and_**
**_commodity market environment._**

We and our management team have proven experience in leading our business through an evolving
regulatory and commodity market environment and are complemented by a skilled operating team who are at the
forefront of biomass conversion technology, including the mechanical, engineering, electrical and civil works
required for such conversion. We have successfully transformed a pure coal generation business into a diversified
and vertically-integrated generator and supplier of flexible, low-carbon and renewable electricity. As a result of
this transformation, we are an industry-leader with extensive experience and operational knowledge of biomass
and its related supply chain logistics and are highly experienced in the successful delivery of large-scale
conversion of generation from coal. We have also gained significant experience in successfully integrating
businesses into our existing operations, putting us in a strong position to capitalise on our acquisition of Opus
and the DGEL Assets.

We believe the project to convert the first three of our generation units to biomass remains Europe’s largest
decarbonisation project, which was delivered on time and within budget. This experience enabled us to deliver
the low-cost conversion of a fourth biomass-fired generation unit in August 2018 and will position us to deliver
on our pipeline of options to convert either one or both of our two remaining coal-fired generation units to gas
generation, develop a 1.8GW CCGT plant at our Damhead Creek II site and/or develop our OCGT assets (in each
case, subject to a positive investment decision and appropriate support through the Capacity Market).

Our operational experience in handling biomass is also market-leading. We have developed innovative fuelhandling systems, logistics and storage solutions for biomass fuel as well as a bespoke technically-advanced
covered rail wagon with a specialised door design and a patented product flow control system to manage biomass
during discharge.

Further, we have developed an in-depth understanding of the scientific and technological effects of burning
a range of biomass fuels, as well as of the critical combustion characteristics of such fuels.

We have also put in place a biomass sustainability policy, which includes comprehensive carbon footprinting across our biomass supply chain, regular independent supplier audits and the use of third party
sustainability certification. All our biomass is procured in accordance with this sustainability policy.

**Strategy**

Our strategy is to deliver a stronger, more predictable, long-term financial performance for the Group along
with greater diversification in the markets in which we operate. By doing so, we seek to enable a zero-carbon,
lower-cost energy future.

**_Maintain stable earnings visibility by focusing on contractual revenue streams._**

Historically, the vast majority of the Group’s earnings were derived from the operation of Drax Power
Station as a merchant plant, selling wholesale power independently to third parties. Accordingly, the Group’s
earnings were volatile and exposed to commodity price or merchant risk. In recent years, the Group’s earnings
have diversified and the Group’s exposure to commodity price risk has substantially reduced.

In the Power Generation segment, we intend to maintain our visibility of future earnings and cash flows
through the contracted earnings of Capacity Market and Ancillary Services payments. We expect this, combined
with the support we receive under the CfD Regime and RO Scheme, will result in a reduced level of commodity
markets exposure and increased stability and visibility of earnings.

We have secured index-linked Capacity Market agreements for our two coal-fired generation units and the
three small ancillary gas turbines located at Drax Power Station, which are expected to result in contract-based
revenues of approximately £83 million between October 2018 to 30 September 2022 in aggregate and similar
agreements for certain of our pumped storage, hydro and CCGT assets, which are expected to result in contractbased revenues in excess of £156 million in aggregate between October 2018 to 30 September 2022, in each
case, subject to the re-establishment of the Capacity Market.

We are developing a pipeline of options, which could include repowering the remaining two coal-fired
generation units at Drax Power Station to gas, leveraging expertise from prior conversions and using existing

157


-----

infrastructure at Drax Power Station. If developed, each repowered unit will deliver stable, contract-based
earnings and extend the operating life of Drax Power Station through to the late 2030s whilst providing 1.8GW
of generation capacity. Our pipeline of options also includes further gas generation opportunities ranging from
developing our Damhead Creek II site into a 1.8GW CCGT power station to the development of up to four
299MW rapid-response OCGT plants. We believe that additional rapid response power plants will be required to
keep the UK’s electricity system stable in the future. If commissioned, our four new 299MW OCGT plants in
England and Wales will have the potential to provide fast, flexible gas generation to support the UK electricity
system at times of peak demand, will diversify our future energy generation capability and, subject to receipt of
appropriate support through the Capacity Market (if and when the Capacity Market is re-established), will
provide stable contract-based revenues. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—The
_Capacity Market in the UK is currently suspended and its future is uncertain”._

With increasing levels of intermittent generation, we are continuing to identify opportunities to create value
from our ability to flexibly operate our generation assets according to prevailing market conditions, such as
short-term power and balancing market activity, the provision of Ancillary Services and the increased margin
achieved from coal-fired generation due to the use of out-of-specification fuels. Our recent acquisition of
ScottishPower’s 2.6GW portfolio of assets significantly strengthens our offerings in this area and we focus
resources on optimising availability and flexibility of our coal, biomass, CCGT and pumped storage generation
assets to capture value in these markets. The flexible, dispatchable and responsive nature of our generation assets
positions us well to compete in the market and the development of our OCGT plants, our coal-to-gas conversion
project at Drax Power Station and our Damhead Creek II CCGT development project would further bolster our
offering in this market. With the changing grid dynamic, this market could grow significantly.

**_Profitably grow our B2B Energy Supply segment._**

One of our objectives is to increase the proportion of revenue and earnings generated by our B2B Energy
Supply segment by increasing our focus on the SME market, which generally has higher margins than the I&C
market, and by evaluating options for further margin enhancement, such as product alternatives and efficiency
enhancement.

We have a strong platform for growth in the B2B Energy Supply segment. Our B2B Energy Supply segment
is the fifth largest supplier of electricity to businesses in the UK by volume supplied as of 31 October 2018 and
the largest provider of renewable energy to businesses. As of 31 December 2018, we supplied over 396,000
electricity and gas meters and, in 2018, we supplied 17.9 TWh of electricity, of which 69 per cent. was from
renewable generation, representing an 11 per cent. share of the B2B electricity market. As the power system
transforms, we will be working closely with our customers to help them adapt to more decentralised and
decarbonised power. We consider this a significant opportunity for the Group in the medium and long term and
we expect our B2B Energy Supply segment to continue to deliver new products and services and enhanced
market coverage, driving market share growth across both the I&C and the SME markets.

**_Expand wood pellet self-supply and increase operational and supply chain efficiencies._**

Our target is to supply Drax Power Station with up to 30 per cent. of its annual demand for sustainable wood
pellets from our own production in the future. Our wood pellet manufacturing facilities supply all of their output
to Drax Power Station and supplied 18.0 per cent. of our internal requirements for generation from sustainable
biomass in 2018. We expect output to increase throughout 2019, following the successful commissioning in 2018
of our third wood pellet manufacturing facility at LaSalle. All three of our wood pellet manufacturing facilities
have the capability to manufacture wood pellets at their nameplate capacity (a total of 1,500,000 tonnes). We are
developing options to increase capacity at our LaSalle and Morehouse facilities by 175,000 tonnes in aggregate
by 2021, which would represent a 13 per cent. increase on our current production capacity when the incremental
capacity is fully commissioned. Our wood pellet manufacturing facilities are strategically located close to one
another in the US Gulf region for operational and supply chain efficiencies. We intend to continue consolidating
supply from third parties at our Baton Rouge port facility to utilise unused export capacity and to drive further
supply chain efficiencies.

We have continued to identify opportunities to improve efficiencies in our supply chain. For example, we
are building and commissioning a new rail spur linking our LaSalle facility to the regional rail network and our
port facility at Baton Rouge, which will increase transportation efficiency and economies of scale and reduce the
cost and carbon footprint of our operations. We expect further efficiencies from our collaboration with Hunt
Forest Products, a biomass fibre supplier, which commissioned the construction of a sawmill next to our LaSalle
facility in January 2019. We anticipate this collaboration will reduce our raw material transport costs and overall
biomass cost.

158


-----

More generally, we are actively focused on increasing the proportion of good quality wood pellets received
at Drax Power Station and reducing the amount of wood pellet degradation or “fines”. We have a number of
active internal workstreams to reduce fines and our progress on this front is a key focus for the Group.
Separately, we have a series of Group-wide initiatives to reduce the cost of our biomass supply chain with a view
to improving margins from biomass generation in the short term and positioning our Generation Segment to be
able to deliver profitable biomass generation without subsidy if no further subsidy regimes are put in place from
2027.

We further intend to optimise supply chain and logistics operations for our Power Generation segment, and
to utilise the flexibility of self-supply to manage production, to allow it to benefit from attractively priced
biomass cargoes in the spot market.

**_Continue to focus on operational excellence._**

We continually work to improve our performance across all segments. Having established ourselves as a
leader in managing sustainable biomass-based electricity generation across the entire value chain, we aim to
leverage this expertise to continue developing our business.

We continue to focus on engineering excellence and improving the efficiency and economic life through
investment in our asset base. For example, over the next three years we plan to continue to invest in replacing
and upgrading the high-pressure turbines in our biomass-fired units to improve efficiency, reduce maintenance
costs and increase unit flexibility. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operations—Results of Operations—Capital and Operating Expenditure”._

We are focused on improving the operational gains from our wood pellet manufacturing facilities,
responding to planned and unplanned events at Drax Power Station through seamless teamwork to maintain high
availability and ensuring an excellent standard of customer service at our B2B Energy Supply segment. Safety
and sustainability remain at the centre of our operational philosophy, recognising that excellent safety
performance at our generating assets and our wood pellet manufacturing facilities drives efficiency and improves
the productivity of our assets, and we are a consistent top quartile performer for safety performance. All of our
biomass is procured in line with our industry-leading sustainability criteria, ensuring that the wood pellets we use
for electricity generation are sustainable and low carbon.

**Principal Activities and Markets**

Our three principal activities are:

   - the generation of electricity, which is carried out through our Power Generation segment;

   - the supply of electricity (predominantly low-carbon and renewable energy) and gas to business customers
in the business-to-business market, which is carried out through our B2B Energy Supply segment; and

   - the production and supply of sustainable wood pellets at our processing facilities in the US, which is
carried out through our Pellet Production segment.

**_Power Generation_**

We currently generate the majority of our electricity via our core asset, Drax Power Station, which is owned
by Drax Power. In December 2018, we diversified our generation capacity by acquiring a 2.6GW portfolio of
pumped storage, hydro and gas-fired generation assets from ScottishPower.

_Drax Power Station: General_

Drax Power Station is located in North Yorkshire, on the banks of the River Ouse, between the towns of
Selby and Goole. The Drax Power Station site, comprising approximately 1,850 acres, is close to supplies of
cooling water and has convenient road and rail access to nearby port capacity.

Drax Power Station is the largest power station in the UK, with approximately 4.0GW of connected
installed capacity from its six main generation units, each of which can be operated independently. Between 2008
and 2012, all the high pressure and low pressure turbines at Drax Power Station were upgraded to increase the
efficiency of generation and reducing fuel consumption and carbon emissions. We plan to upgrade the high
pressure turbines in our biomass units in the next three years to further increase efficiency and reduce
maintenance costs. Between 2013 and 2016, three of the six generation units were converted to run on
sustainable biomass, with a fourth unit converted in August 2018 at a cost of approximately £30 million (which

159

is lower than the cost of converting each of the previous three biomass fired generation units). Three ancillary
OCGT generation units, each with a capacity of 32MW, provide standby power to start up the main generating
plant and to supply electricity to the Transmission System if necessary. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our
_Business and Industry—The reduction or abandonment of governmental support for generation of electricity_
_from biomass or other relevant changes in governmental energy policy may materially adversely affect our_
_business, operations, financial condition and results of operations”._

Drax Power Station’s main generation units are able to burn a range of fuels, with four units currently
running on sustainable biomass in the form of wood pellets and two units currently burning coal and coal
derivatives, such as petroleum coke and coal mining residue “pond fines” (waste by-products of the quarrying
process). We are developing options to repower these two remaining coal-fired generation units to gas and build
supporting battery storage. This project could replace the existing c.1.3GW of coal-fired generation capacity with
up to 3.6GW of gas generation capacity (capable of running in either open cycle and combined cycle modes) and
up to 200MW of supporting battery storage, subject to a positive investment decision, obtaining consent and
other approvals and the award of 15-year Capacity Market agreements or similar support in future Capacity
Market auctions subject to the Capacity Market being re-established. See “Risk Factors—Risk Factors Relating
_to Our Business and Industry—The Capacity Market in the UK is currently suspended and its future is_
_uncertain”. This repowering and storage project would further enhance our flexible generation capacity and_
complete our transition away from coal generation entirely. In the years ended 31 March 2017 and 31 March
2018, for each MWh of electricity generated from sustainable biomass, Drax Power Station emitted 36g of CO2
over the full carbon lifecycle (the UK limit for 2015-2020 is 79g of CO2 per MWh of electricity generated),
86 per cent. less CO2 compared to electricity generated from Drax Power Station’s coal fired units. This
calculation compares the supply chain emissions for all biomass used by us against the CO2 emissions which
would have been created through the combustion of coal. For the purposes of this calculation, the biogenic CO2
emissions from burning sustainable biomass at Drax Power Station are considered to be zero in line with the
methodology developed by the UNFCCC and reflecting that the CO2 released in the process of burning
sustainable biomass has been absorbed from the atmosphere during the growth of the feedstock. We currently
have four generation units converted to biomass, which are capable of burning approximately eight million
tonnes of sustainable biomass per year. For further information on carbon emissions, see “Industry Overview—
_Electricity market: regulatory context—The EU Emissions Trading System” and “Industry Overview—UK clean_
_energy legislation”._

The UK electricity market that we operate in is changing. A greater amount of intermittent generating
capacity is becoming available to the market and at the same time older and less efficient thermal plants with the
ability to generate electricity more consistently are withdrawing. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change has stated that 70-85 per cent. of global electricity will need to come from renewables by 2050 if the
target of limiting the worldwide temperature increase to 1.5°C is going to be achieved, and given that most
renewable generation is intermittent in nature. In this context, there is a greater need for forms of generation
which are flexible and responsive to the needs of the electricity grid. In this context, there is a greater need for
forms of generation which are flexible and responsive to the needs of the electricity grid. Generation systems that
are able to turn up at times of peak demand and turn down at times of excess supply provide certainty of
electricity availability and flexibility, if necessary. All generation units at Drax Power Station are capable of
operating independently and flexibly with a high level of availability, making them an important component of a
stable, secure and well-functioning electricity grid.

_DGEL: General_

On 31 December 2018, we acquired ScottishPower’s portfolio of pumped storage, hydro and gas-fired
generation assets for initial consideration of £687 million (based on total consideration of £702 million, less
customary net debt and working capital adjustments), which we renamed Drax Generation Enterprise Limited.
The acquisition of these assets enables us to meet the growing need for forms of generation which are flexible
and responsive to the needs of the electricity grid, and to diversify our generation capacity in order to become a
multi-site, multi-technology national power operator.

This portfolio of long life renewable assets and flexible gas generation assets diversifies our generation
capacity, and delivers increased visibility of long term earnings and a high proportion of non-commodity related
earnings. Our ability to generate using a range of different technologies with different dispatch economics and
provide a range of Ancillary Services means we are less exposed to risks inherent to single technologies and
movements in individual commodity prices. For example, at a generation level, a fall in gas prices, which would
typically cause electricity prices to decrease, could be mitigated by an increase in gas-fired generation.

The Cruachan pumped storage hydro power plant is located in Argyll and Bute, Scotland. The Cruachan
power plant is built into the hollowed-out rock of the mountain, Ben Cruachan. It uses electricity from the grid at
times of low demand to pump water from Loch Awe to its storage reservoir part way up the mountain and also
collects water from the surrounding hills. At times of peak demand, water is released from the reservoir through
the station’s turbines to generate electricity. Cruachan, which provides over 35 per cent. of the UK’s pumpedstorage capacity, can provide long-duration storage with the ability to achieve full load in 30 seconds, which it
can maintain for over 16 hours, making it a strategically important asset remunerated by a broad range of noncommodity based revenues. Cruachan’s four electricity generation units have a total capacity of 440MW, two of
which generate up to 120MW, and the other two up to 100MW. Cruachan has four primary modes of operation:
generating (supplying electricity to the transmission system), pumping (taking electricity from the transmission
system), spin gen (spinning without waterflow, to ready the system to generate electricity at short notice) and
Spin Pump. The facility can deliver a range of balancing services and Ancillary Services, including frequency
response or generating or absorbing reactive power.

The Galloway and Lanark hydro power plants are located in south-west Scotland. Galloway and Lanark are
distribution-connected stations capable of generating up to a combined 126MW of stable renewable electricity.
Lanark (17MW) benefits from index-linked ROC revenues extending until 2027. Galloway (109MW) benefits
from index-linked ROC revenues until 2027 with respect to approximately 28MW of its generation capacity, in
addition to which it operates a reservoir and dam system providing power storage capabilities and opportunities
for peaking and system support services.

Our CCGT power stations at Damhead Creek (805MW), Rye House (715MW) and Shoreham (420MW) are
all located in the South-East of England and are together capable of generating up to 1,940MW of electricity.
These assets provide baseload and peak power generation in addition to other system support services, and
benefit from grid access income associated with their location in the South-East of England where energy
demand is highest. Given their location, these assets allow us to deliver electricity whilst incurring lower
distribution charges. Damhead Creek has held frequency response contracts with the System Operator and is
regularly used in the Balancing Mechanism for energy and system services. In addition to these stations, we also
own a small CCGT power station at Blackburn (60MW) in Northern England.

The rapid-start facilities in our generation portfolio means that we have the ability to bring significant
capacity on-line at short notice, allowing us to take advantage of higher electricity prices and provides particular
Ancillary Services to the System Operator.

As part of the DGEL Acquisition we also acquired a biomass-from-waste pellet production facility in
Daldowie. Situated in Uddingston, near Glasgow, the facility processes sludge from a wastewater treatment plant
and converts it into dry, low-odour fuel pellets. The facility can produce approximately 50,000 tonnes of pellets
per annum that can be used as a sustainable fuel source.

Integration of the DGEL Assets into the Drax portfolio is progressing well and joint executive steering
committees are regularly held to ensure a smooth transition.

_Thermal generation process_

To generate electricity from either sustainable biomass or coal, the underlying fuel is pulverised into a
powder and then blown into boilers, where the fuel is burned. The heat generated by the boiler turns demineralised water into super-heated steam at 568 degrees Celsius, which is fed at high pressure through a series
of turbines. The shafts of these turbines are coupled to large cylindrical electromagnets known as rotors, which
produce electricity as the turbine rotates. The electricity generated is then increased from 23.5kV to 400kV,
allowing for the export of electricity onto the Transmission System. The electricity is eventually reduced to 230V
for use by customers.

The de-mineralised water in the boilers forms part of a closed system and, once turned into super-heated
steam and fed through the high-pressure turbines, is returned to the boiler for reheating before passing through
further intermediate and low pressure turbines to increase the overall efficiency of the generation process.
Subsequently the steam is condensed and recycled back into the boiler. Excess heat in the form of water vapour
is released into the atmosphere by way of cooling towers.

Our CCGT power stations produce electricity by using both a gas and a steam turbine in tandem to produce
electricity. The gas and steam turbines are powered from the same source of fuel. The fuel is combusted, with the
resulting heat converted into mechanical energy, which in turn drives electrical generators. After completing its
cycle (in the first engine), the temperature of the working fluid in the system is still high enough that a second
subsequent heat engine extracts energy from the heat produced by the first engine. By combining these multiple
streams of work upon a single mechanical shaft turning an electric generator, the overall efficiency of the CCGT
is higher than OCGT units.

Due to Drax Power Station’s design, each unit can operate full time as a baseload generator, or can turn up
or down or be taken off line and put back on line with minimal effect on the operating capabilities of the other
units. Similarly, the two gas units at our 805MW Damhead Creek CCGT power station and three gas turbines at
our 715MW Rye House CCGT power station can each turn up or down or be taken off line and put back on line
with minimal effect on the operating capabilities of the other respective gas turbine(s) at those stations. At Drax
Power Station and each of our CCGT power stations, generation increases when demand is high, units are
available and it is economic for a unit, whether coal, gas or sustainable biomass, to run. In the competitive UK
wholesale electricity market, the economics of running a unit are determined by the short-run marginal cost of
each technology, which is based on the variable cost of generating a unit of electricity for the relevant half-hour.

When there is demand for electricity, the generators that are available with the lowest short-run marginal
cost operate until the projected demand in that half-hour is met, subject to balancing actions taken by the System
Operator. Due to the higher cost of carbon in the form of the total carbon price, the cost of coal generation is
higher than it has been historically. As such, Drax Power Station’s coal-fired generation units are not expected to
deliver baseload electricity for significant lengths of time prior to their closure or repowering, and are
increasingly run to provide electricity to the grid when there are low levels of generation from intermittent
sources of energy (e.g., during low-wind periods) or in the balancing mechanism to provide system support
services. In contrast, the biomass-fired generation units, which benefit from renewable energy support under
either the RO Scheme or the CfD Regime, are predominantly delivering either baseload electricity or electricity
in peak periods when optimal to do so within the ROC cap under the RO scheme. For further information on the
RO Scheme see “Industry Overview—UK Clean Energy Legislation—The Renewables Obligation”.

Our gas-fired power stations have a lower-cost of carbon than coal units and therefore tend to operate more
frequently, albeit none are expected to deliver baseload electricity for significant periods of time. Our CCGTs at
Damhead Creek and Shoreham are expected to run most days through the year at times when electricity demand
is high, whereas Rye House (which has a lower efficiency) is expected to provide system support services or to
run for short periods in the balancing mechanism (for example on low wind days).

In order to further enhance our flexible generation capacity and complete our transition from coal generation
to using lower-carbon and renewable fuel sources, we are developing an option for up to 3.6GW of gas

162


-----

generation on the site of our two remaining coal units at Drax Power Station. This would utilise existing
infrastructure to deliver a lower-cost solution for new gas-fired generation (capable of running in either open
cycle or combined cycle modes) and reduce carbon emissions versus coal, with a wide operating range covering
baseload and peaking generation, in addition to system support services. Within this development we are
including an option for up to 200MW of supporting battery storage capability through which we could provide
immediate system support services to the electricity system and customers. The development is approaching the
final stages of the Development Consent Order examination phase and could participate in future Capacity
Market auctions, seeking 15-year Capacity Market agreements or similar support, subject to the Capacity Market
being re-established. Furthermore, we are progressing the development of options for four new 299MW OCGT
plants in England and Wales. Each of these plants has the potential to provide flexible and reliable electricity to
the UK electricity system and diversify our future energy generation capability subject to a positive investment
decision and appropriate support through the Capacity Market, if and when re-established. As part of the DGEL
Acquisition, the Group also acquired a permitted option for the development of a 1.8GW CCGT plant at
Damhead Creek with all necessary consents, which would also need to be underpinned by a 15-year Capacity
Market agreement or similar support to be developed, subject to the Capacity Market being re-established. For
further information on the Capacity Market, see “Industry Overview—Overview of Electricity Market Reform—
_Capacity Market”._

_Pumped storage generation process_

Our Cruachan pumped storage facility uses off-peak electricity from the grid at times of low demand, when
electricity prices are generally lower, to pump water from Loch Awe to its storage reservoir on Ben Cruachan
mountain. Water is also collected from the surrounding hills. At times of peak demand, when electricity prices
are generally higher, water is released from the reservoir through the station’s turbines to generate electricity.
Cruachan’s total capacity of 440MW is split between four units, two of which generate up to 120MW, and the
other two up to 100MW. Cruachan has four primary modes of operation, generating (supplying electricity to the
transmission system), pumping (taking electricity from the transmission system), Spin Gen and spin pump
(spinning without waterflow, to ready the system to pump water at short notice). The facility can deliver a range
of balancing and Ancillary Services, including “frequency response” (altering output to ensure the frequency of
electricity in the Transmission System is within statutory limits) or generating or absorbing “reactive power” (the
means by which system voltage is maintained within acceptable levels). The plant can switch between the modes
to meet commercial requirements or as required by the System Operator.

_Hydro generation process_

Our Lanark and Galloway hydro power plants have a combined capacity of 126MW, using the energy from
flowing water to generate electricity and deliver baseload electricity, since they have no fuel costs and can
therefore be run in a cost-efficient manner even at times of minimum demand.

Our Lanark facility is powered by three waterfalls, and uses weirs to divert water from the river to generate
electricity. Our Galloway facility was the first large-scale integrated hydro complex to be built in Great Britain
and consists of six power stations, eight dams and a network of tunnels, aqueducts and pipelines.

_Availability_

Availability of the generating units at our power stations is influenced by planned maintenance outages, as
well as unplanned or forced outages, which are required from time to time to rectify malfunctions or other
failures. During 2018, Drax Power Station generated approximately 18.3 TWh of electricity compared to 20.0
TWh in 2017, principally due to two unplanned outages on our biomass units in the first quarter of 2018, albeit
the one major planned outage in the year was completed to schedule and allowed for the conversion of a fourth
generation unit from coal-to biomass-fired generation in August 2018.

Our maintenance regime for each unit at Drax Power Station and each of our gas-fired generation units
typically includes a major planned outage once every four years to enable a detailed examination of each part of
the pressure system plant. Planned outages are usually undertaken during the summer months, when electricity
demand is lower. There is consequently an irregular pattern to planned outages at Drax Power Station and
associated expenditure, since typically in two of every four years two units will each undergo a major planned
outage. In anticipation of an end to unabated electricity generation from coal by 2025, we have implemented a
leaner maintance schedule for the two coal fired generation units and deferred certain maintenance work. In
addition, as our CCGT generating units are at the mid-to-end of their life range, it will be necessary upgrade
these facilities to extend their useful economic life and mitigate increased technical risks. See “Management’s

163


-----

_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—_
_Capital Expenditure”._

We will undertake a major planned outage on our fourth biomass-fired generation unit in summer 2019,
followed by a major outage on our second biomass-fired generation unit in autumn 2019. We also expect to
undertake a planned outage at our Rye House CCGT power station and a minor inspection at our Damhead Creek
CCGT power station during 2019. We do not expect these outages will have a notable impact on profitability
given that generation from our biomass units is commercially constrained by the operation of the ROC cap and
the seasonality of the outages, which are concentrated in summer months when electricity demand is lower. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—We are dependent on continued output from our
_facilities, in particular Drax Power Station, and outages at Drax Power Station or any of our other facilities_
_could negatively affect our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations”._

To comply with the Reservoirs Act (Scotland) 2011, our maintenance regime of our hydro assets comprises
a series of planned routine tests of emergency apparatuses associated with dam safety, annual inspections by a
Reservoir Panel Engineer and a 10-year thorough examination by an independent Dam Panel Inspection
Engineer. Our maintenance regime for the traditional turbine generator assets at our hydro facilities typically
includes annual inspections, minor planned outages every four years and major planned outages every 12 years to
complement a routine preventative maintenance regime.

Unplanned maintenance or forced outages occur on all units due to unexpected plant breakdown, such as
boiler tube leaks. Preventative maintenance is carried out to control and reduce forced outage rates. This work
includes the monitoring, inspection and replacement of operating equipment. The frequency of such work is
dependent on the operating and failure history of each equipment type and takes into account historical
maintenance schedules and procedures, manufacturers’ recommendations and statutory inspection requirements.
This approach is typical of the industry.

_Fuel procurement_

Drax Power Station uses sustainable biomass and coal as fuel. In the Power Generation segment, cost of fuel
is the principal driver of total cost of sales and for periods ending prior to 1 January 2019 represents the cost of
purchasing the coal (including the cost of carbon) and sustainable biomass that is used to generate electricity in
Drax Power Station (net of any ROC support earned). Fuel costs increased by £357.2 million, or 26.3 per cent.,
from £1,356.8 million in 2017 to £1,714.0 million in 2018. Our four CCGT power stations acquired as part of the
DGEL Acquisition use gas as fuel. The cost of fuel for these stations includes the cost of purchasing gas,
including the cost of carbon.

_Sustainable biomass_

In 2018, approximately 7 million tonnes of sustainable biomass were burned for electricity generation at
Drax Power Station. Our wood pellet manufacturing facilities supplied 12.3 per cent. and 18.0 per cent. of our
internal requirements for generation from sustainable biomass in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Our three wood
pellet manufacturing facilities have the capacity to supply approximately 20 per cent. of our internal
requirements now that they are capable of operating at their maximum capacity. Our strategic target is to increase
the share of sustainable biomass pellets sourced from our manufacturing facilities to up to 30 per cent. in the
future. To make up the shortfall between our own production capacity for sustainable biomass pellets and our
requirements for sustainable biomass pellets, we have negotiated a portfolio of predominantly long-term biomass
fuel supply contracts. We do not depend on a sole supplier. Two of our wood pellet manufacturing facilities,
Amite and Morehouse, are able to manufacture wood pellets at a capacity of 525,000 tonnes per year and our
LaSalle plant, which was fully commissioned in 2018, is able to manufacture wood pellets at a capacity of
450,000 tonnes per year. Additionally, we are developing options to increase capacity at our LaSalle and
Morehouse facilities by 175,000 tonnes in aggregate by 2020 and 2021, respectively (which would represent a
13 per cent. increase on our current production capacity when the incremental capacity is fully commissioned),
which we anticipate will incur a small fraction of the equivalent cost of building a new pellet production plant.

In addition, where liquidity permits, we purchase supplemental volumes of sustainable biomass on the spot
market each year and also purchase additional volumes for delivery within 18 months of contract execution. Selfsupply enables us to manage biomass supply with our planned outages at Drax Power Station and to benefit from
biomass cargoes in the short-term spot market.

The sustainable biomass pellets sourced by us are required to meet Drax Power Station’s fuel specification
which, in turn, is designed to meet Drax Power Station’s operating requirements and certain sustainability criteria

164


-----

for the electricity produced from them to be eligible for ROCs and CfD support. The RO Scheme and CfD
Regime require, among other things, that the wood pellets are sourced from sustainably managed sources.

In addition to investment in the wood pellet manufacturing process, we also continue to seek to identify
ways of investing in supporting infrastructure to improve the wider efficiency of the facilities. For example, we
have built and commissioned a new rail spur linking our LaSalle facility to the regional rail network and our port
facility at Baton Rouge, which will increase transportation efficiency and economies of scale and reduce the cost
and carbon footprint of our operations. We expect further efficiencies from our collaboration with Hunt Forest
Products, a biomass fibre supplier, which commissioned the construction of a sawmill next to our LaSalle facility
in January 2019. We anticipate this collaboration will reduce our raw material transport costs and overall
biomass cost.

Supply contracts include penalty mechanisms if the fuel does not meet certain technical specifications. We
also impose contractual obligations on our sustainable biomass pellet suppliers requiring them to satisfy the
relevant sustainability criteria and conduct supplier audits using third party auditors. Alternatively, suppliers can
evidence that they comply with the necessary sustainability requirements through Sustainable Biomass Program
(“SBP”) certification, as SBP-compliant material has been benchmarked by Ofgem to fully meet the UK
sustainability requirements. We encourage our suppliers to move towards SBP certification and in 2018 we
exceeded our target of sourcing 90 per cent. SBP-certified biomass fuel. We do not contract with counterparties
who do not meet our biomass sustainability requirements.

Most sustainable biomass pellets used by us are sourced from outside the UK and priced in US dollars,
Canadian dollars or euro. In 2018, 62 per cent. and 17 per cent. of our sustainable biomass supply was imported
from the US and Canada, respectively (compared with 58 per cent. and 24 per cent. in 2017, respectively). The
remainder whilst still priced in US dollars, Canadian dollars or euro, was sourced primarily from Brazil (1 per
cent.) and various European countries, including Latvia (10 per cent.), Estonia (4 per cent.), Portugal (3 per
cent.), and the UK (1 per cent.). For further information with respect to foreign currency exchange exposures
inherent within the cost of biomass, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operations—Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Derivative Financial Instruments”._

_Biomass supply chain_

Biomass pellets are hygroscopic and so readily absorb moisture from the environment. As a result, pellets
must be kept dry and cannot be stored outside. These characteristics required us to develop and construct
specialist storage and transport facilities.

We import wood pellets into the UK via biomass import facilities at each of the ports of Tyne, Hull,
Liverpool and Immingham, together providing a combined total import capacity of more than 11 million tonnes
per year, providing operational flexibility and headroom in excess of our anticipated generation requirements.
Each port contains specialist equipment for the discharge, storage and monitoring and subsequent loading of
wood pellets to rail or road transport for onward haulage to Drax Power Station.

Our total port storage capacity in the UK is approximately 400,000 tonnes. In addition to storage at ports,
we have approximately 250,000 tonnes of additional storage space available close to the ports and over 300,000
tonnes available at Drax Power Station.

Wood pellets are primarily transported from ports to Drax Power Station by rail. Rail paths between UK
ports and Drax Power Station have been secured to meet our requirements and fluctuations in demand allowing
over 130 train-loads of wood pellets per week to be delivered to Drax Power Station. We have, in partnership
with industry specialists, developed a bespoke biomass rail wagon capable of carrying large volumes of biomass
with capacity of almost one-third more than that of a coal rail wagon converted to transport biomass. Each wagon
in our fleet of nine sets of wagons (comprising 225 individual wagons in total) has covers to ensure that the
biomass pellets are kept dry during transit and have fully automated top and bottom doors, which allow loading
and unloading to be carried out while the trains are in motion, increasing efficiency in the rail transport operation.
At our UK and US port facilities and at Drax Power Station, the pellets are stored in technically advanced storage
spaces with dust control infrastructure to reduce the risk of fire and explosions.

The location of our Pellet Production segment assets allows us to leverage the benefits of multiple assets for
operational efficiencies. Our three pellet manufacturing facilities and our Baton Rouge port facility are located
within a 200-mile radius of each other, allowing for flexibility through the outage cycle at the manufacturing
plants, sharing spares of key equipment across the facilities and the efficient use of human capital. The pellet
manufacturing facilities also share logistics connections to our port facility at Baton Rouge and benefit from

165


-----

complementary fibre sourcing, allowing for the optimisation of supply between plants. In 2018, we also relocated
our US head office from Atlanta, Georgia to Monroe, Louisiana, to be closer to our pellet production and port
facilities, providing further efficiencies and operational savings. We have a strategic target to self-supply up to
30 per cent. of our internal requirements for generation from sustainable biomass, but an increase to this level
requires us to acquire existing plants or expand organically.

Beyond our internal production of biomass, we seek to contract with biomass producers in locations that
maximise operational efficiencies and flexibility.

While our own production has increased significantly, we have retained operational flexibility, which means
we are able to take advantage of spot market opportunities and manage the flow of our biomass supply chain as
part of the major planned biomass outage programme in the Power Generation segment. We are generally
protected from short-term volatility in foreign exchange rates, due to having an active rolling five-year foreign
exchange hedging programme with respect to the currencies in which purchases of wood pellets are denominated
(predominantly US dollars, Canadian dollars and euro).

_Coal_

The proportion of our generation from coal and coal derivatives has declined over the past five years as we
converted four of Drax Power Station’s six generation units to run on sustainable biomass and acquired a
diversified portfolio of hydro and gas assets with the DGEL Acquisition. In 2018, 1.96 million tonnes of coal and
coal derivatives were delivered to Drax Power Station, a decline of approximately 80 per cent. since 2013. This
decline is expected to continue over the coming years as we move further away from coal-fired generation and
develop plans to repower the remaining two coal-fired generation units.

We purchase coal on both a forward basis and in the spot market to enable us to take advantage of
favourable market conditions, if available. Due to the lower utilisation of the coal units, we do not keep
significant stockpiles of coal and predominantly purchase coal on a spot basis where there is scope to generate
profitably. Coal is more readily available than sustainable biomass and the storage requirements are less
stringent, so stock can be held in smaller volumes to allow us to take advantage of short-term spot opportunities
in the electricity market with spot purchases and deliveries of coal scheduled throughout the year to supplement
stocks should electricity demand require it.

With increasing levels of intermittent renewables in use in the UK, we are continuing to see opportunities
for system support services in the Balancing Market and Ancillary Services market. Our coal units are currently
well-placed to generate earnings from the Balancing Mechanism (in addition to the provision of Ancillary
Services) by running less often but capturing better prices.

We purchase coal from a range of sources with the objective of managing our commercial and credit
exposure, environmental obligations such as the IED, the Best Available Techniques Reference document for
Large Combustion Plants and diversity of supply. In 2018, approximately 23 per cent. of the coal we used was
sourced from mines in the UK and the remainder was sourced from major supply basins from the US, Colombia
and Russia. The proportion of coal sourced domestically has steadily decreased over recent years due to, among
other things, air emissions and other environmental regulations and declining domestic production volumes. In
the future, we expect that the vast majority of coal will continue to be sourced from international suppliers. For
further information, see “Industry Overview—Electricity market: regulatory context—Capacity constraints”. We
try to avoid buying generic coals where the origin is uncertain, but we continue to source attractively priced fuel
cargoes such as out-of-specification coals (coal that does not meet another buyer’s contracted specification) and
distressed cargoes (cargoes without a buyer) which help keep costs down for the business.

We hedge our exposure against fluctuations in prices in this respect through financial derivatives contracts.
See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Significant
_Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Derivative Financial Instruments”._

_Gas_

Drax’s generation portfolio includes four CCGT power stations at Damhead Creek in Kent (805MW),
Shoreham in West Sussex (420MW), Rye House in Hertfordshire (715MW) and Blackburn Mill in Lancashire
(60MW), contributing a total of 2GW to our total generation capacity.

In 2018, approximately 389 million therms of gas was burned for electricity generation at our CCGT power
stations at Damhead Creek, Rye House, Shoreham and Blackburn.

166


-----

We purchase gas around the time we sell the electricity output of a station and purchase associated
emissions allowances, thus locking in the “clean spark spread” (the difference between the wholesale electricity
price and the cost of gas and carbon, including emission allowances). This may be on a forward basis or in the
spot market. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—
_Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Bark Spread, Clean Spark Spread, Dark Green Spread and_
_Hydro Power”._

In addition to providing baseload and peak generation, all our CCGT assets (other than Blackburn, which is
connected directly to the Distribution System and does not deliver electricity to the Transmission System) have
opportunities for system support services in the Balancing Market and Ancillary Services.

Since acquiring our CCGT power stations on 31 December 2018, we have entered into forward and spot
market purchases of gas on wholesale markets to hedge future gas costs where appropriate.

_Electricity and ROC sales and trading strategy_

Electricity generated by Drax Power Station is sold to the wholesale market and via the B2B Energy Supply
segment. In 2018 and 2017, the Power Generation segment derived revenues of £2,003.8 million and
£1,805.4 million, respectively, from electricity sales. Inter-segment sales from the Power Generation segment to
the B2B Energy Supply segment accounted for £1,020.4 million or 50.9 per cent. and £774.5 million or 42.9 per
cent. of the revenue generated from electricity sales in 2018 and 2017, respectively. In the wholesale market, the
majority of our revenues from the sale of electricity and ROCs is derived from sales to the largest energy
suppliers and financial institutions. These companies tend to have a more robust credit profile than smaller
independent suppliers with investment-grade credit ratings from S&P and/or Moody’s. We have robust credit
policies in place to limit the amount of concentration risk we have with any particular counterparty (noting that
the counterparty’s appetite to trade with us is itself based on its assessment of our credit profile) and sales to the
B2B Energy Supply segment (as opposed to third parties) reduces the Power Generation segment’s exposure to
third parties by spreading exposure across a wider customer base. We derived revenues of £555.8 million and
£240.7 million in 2018 (£319.8 million and £289.0 million in 2017) from our top two customers in the Power
Generation segment, representing approximately 18.8 per cent. and 13.1 per cent. of our consolidated revenue in
2018 and 2017, respectively.

Historically, DGEL has sold all of its electrical output and ROCs to entities controlled by Iberdrola, S.A., its
former parent, at prices reflecting the value achieved by the relevant related party with an external counterparty.
Currently, electricity generated by DGEL is sold to Drax Power and traded as a portfolio with electricity from
Drax Power Station, and our electricity and ROC sales and trading strategy for electricity and ROCs generated by
DGEL is substantially the same as that used for the electricity and ROCs generated by Drax Power Station. A
key element of the attractiveness of the assets acquired in the DGEL Acquisition is that they provide system
support services through the balancing market and the provision of Ancillary Services in addition to merchant
power generation. This positions Drax to capture value by supporting the System Operator in managing the
impact of the UK’s transition to a low-carbon economy, as the share of wind and solar generation increases.

Our margin from wholesale electricity generation is only secured, subject to underlying credit exposure,
when the underlying electricity generated by our generation facilities is sold (and, where applicable, the
associated ROC or CfD payment is received) either on the wholesale markets or through our B2B Energy Supply
segment. This electricity will often be sold on a forward basis, although we retain flexibility to make electricity
sales based on the attractiveness of pricing, liquidity and collateral/credit efficiency. For further information, see
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Significant Factors
_Affecting Results of Operations—Bark Spread, Clean Spark Spread, Dark Green Spread and Hydro Power”._

The price of electricity is affected by fluctuations in both supply and demand, which in turn are affected by,
among other things, weather conditions (particularly the availability of wind generation assets) and fluctuations
in the market price of other commodities. To optimise our electricity trading, we utilise all three sub-markets of
the wholesale electricity market: (i) the long-term forward market, (ii) the short-term market (or spot market),
and (iii) the real-time market (the Balancing Mechanism). For further information, see “Industry Overview—
_Wholesale—Overview of the wholesale electricity market”._

_Trading sustainable biomass units_

Our strategy for trading our sustainable biomass units seeks to mitigate the volumetric and pricing risks
associated with the nascent third party biomass supply market by entering into a long-term fuel hedge on
sustainable biomass fuel costs. Sustainable biomass is predominantly acquired on long-term contracts and the

167


-----

basis risk inherent in that contract (for example, fluctuations in currency arising due to the purchase of volumes
in US dollars and/or fluctuations in fuel or freight costs on transporting the sustainable biomass to the UK) is
hedged to the extent we are able to do so, taking into account market availability. Fibre costs are generally
unhedged due to the lack of available hedging products; however, wherever possible, costs are capped in fibre
contracts. The support provided by ROCs and our CfD is indexed to UK RPI and UK CPI, respectively and so
provides a partial hedge against inflation.

For our three generation units that were converted to biomass under the RO Scheme, the ROCs arising from
the sustainable biomass generation are either utilised by the B2B Energy Supply segment or sold to third parties
(on a forward basis where liquidity and pricing permit). We optimise our ROC assets to manage our day-to-day
working capital position. Where we choose to sell ROCs to accelerate cash flows, we may choose to purchase
ROCs at a later date to meet our obligation, leading to an offsetting charge in cost of sales. ROCs may also be
purchased from the market to be utilised by the B2B Energy Supply segment. For further information on the RO
Scheme and ROCs, see “Industry Overview—UK Clean Energy Legislation—Operation of the Renewables
_Obligation”._

For the generation unit that was converted to biomass and benefits from our CfD, our trading strategy aims
to ensure that the price achieved from such sales is broadly aligned to the CfD reference price.

The Power Generation segment sells a significant proportion of its ROCs to our B2B Energy Supply
segment. In the ROC compliance period from 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018 approximately 6.2 million ROCs
were sold to our B2B Energy Supply segment compared to approximately 7.8 million ROCs earned by Drax
Power Station.

For the sustainable biomass-fired generation unit that receives subsidy support via the CfD Regime, the
mechanics of the CfD provide a quasi-hedge against fluctuations in the long-term electricity price.

_Trading coal units_

Our strategy for trading our coal units is focused on obtaining attractive “dark green spreads” (the difference
between the wholesale electricity price and the cost of coal and carbon, including emission allowances) when
available and having the units available to capture value from providing Ancillary Services and from the
Balancing Mechanism. Ancillary Services are a mix of mandatory services, and bilateral agreements with the
System Operator. We normally seek to keep the capacity of one unit for trading close to the time for physical
delivery, thereby reducing the risk that electricity is not delivered in periods of a forced outage. The generation
capacity of the other coal-fired generation unit is generally offered in mid-term and short-term markets. Our
trading strategy is currently being re-assessed following the DGEL Acquisition. For further information, see
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Significant Factors
_Affecting Results of Operations—Bark Spread, Clean Spark Spread, Dark Green Spread and Hydro Power”._

_Trading gas units_

Our strategy for trading our gas units is focused on obtaining attractive clean spark spreads when available
and having the units available to capture value from providing Ancillary Services and from the Balancing
Mechanism. The generation capacity of the gas generation units is generally offered in mid-term and short-term
markets. For further information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operations—Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Bark Spread, Clean Spark Spread,_
_Dark Green Spread and Hydro Power”._

Our CCGT plant in Blackburn is connected directly to the Distribution System, and therefore qualifies for
“embedded benefits” (financial benefits available to smaller-scale power stations as a result of their direct
connection to the Distribution System).

_Trading hydro power plants_

Our strategy for trading our hydro power plants is to sell electricity based on an average forecast of rainfall
through the year. These sales will then be re-profiled in the short-term markets. The running profile will be
dependent on market prices, rainfall, storage capability and river conditions, based on updated and more accurate
forecast data.

The Lanark hydro power plant receives regulatory support from the RO Scheme, and the Galloway hydro
power station receives regulatory support from the RO Scheme with respect to approximately 28MW of its
109MW generating capacity. Our strategy for trading ROCs generated by these facilities is substantially the same

168


-----

as that used for ROCs generated by our biomass units at Drax Power Station, as described under “—Trading
_sustainable biomass units”._

Our hydro power plants are connected directly to the Distribution System, and therefore qualifies for
embedded benefits.

_Daldowie biomass-from-waste facility_

As part of the DGEL Acquisition, we acquired a biomass-from-waste facility located in Daldowie, Scotland.
Our Daldowie facility has the capacity to produce 50,000 tonnes of dry, low-odour pellets annually, which are
currently sold under a firm offtake agreement that extends to 2026.

_Trading pumped storage units_

Our Cruachan pumped storage power plant receives income from providing a number of Ancillary Services
as well as peak power generation. The asset primarily operates in the short-term markets (including the
Balancing Mechanism) with the aim of locking in spreads between exports onto the grid and importing energy to
pump water back into the reservoir.

_Trading ROCs_

Three of our sustainable biomass-fired generation units and our Lanark and Galloway hydro power plants
receive support under the RO Scheme and Drax Power Station (other than the unit receiving support under the
CfD Regime) is accredited by Ofgem as a qualifying renewable plant. The ROCs issued by Ofgem to Drax
Power Station and the hydro power plants at Lanark and Galloway are held electronically on Ofgem’s registry
and are transferred to purchaser registry accounts when sales are completed.

We are eligible to receive ROCs in respect of our generation from sustainable biomass in our first, second
and fourth converted generation units at Drax Power Station, in respect of our generation at the Lanark hydro
power plants and in respect of approximately 28MW of the Galloway hydro power plant’s 109MW of capacity,
in each case until 2027.

We receive one ROC per MWh of electricity generated from those units that are supported by the RO
Scheme. In July 2018, the Renewables Obligation (Amendment) Order 2018 came into force, establishing an
annual ROC cap at the power station level across all RO accredited units equal to DBEIS’s estimate of the
number of ROCs to be received by each grandfathered biomass-fired unit (the first and second converted units at
Drax Power Station) plus 125,000 ROCs for each non-grandfathered unit (the fourth converted unit at Drax
Power Station). Though we may not always reach the annual station-level ROC cap, the conversion of this fourth
generation unit to biomass therefore gives us the flexibility to optimise our generation across all RO-accredited
units at Drax Power Station in a way that maximises the number of ROCs we receive within the aggregate cap
providing valuable operating redundancy. For example if output from either of the first two converted units at
Drax Power Station were to be lower than DBEIS’s estimated output, Drax could then increase the generation
under the fourth converted unit in excess of 125,000 MWh to make up the shortfall. For further information on
ROCs, see “Industry Overview—UK clean energy legislation—Operation of the Renewables Obligation”. During
the compliance period between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018, Drax Power Station received more ROCs than
any other single generation site in the UK. Historically, we have sold the majority of our ROCs to third party
electricity suppliers. Where we choose to sell ROCs to accelerate cash flows, we may choose to purchase ROCs
at a later date to meet our obligations, leading to an offsetting charge in cost of sales. For the year ended
31 December 2018, following these actions there was a similar value in revenue and cost of sales for ROC sales
and purchases.

_Ancillary Services and Capacity Market payments_

In the Power Generation segment, we also derive revenues from Ancillary Services, which amounted to
£18.8 million in 2018 compared to £30.7 million in 2017. Ancillary Services comprise the provision of a range of
system support services contracted directly with the System Operator (other than the Balancing Mechanism). The
type, length and value of these Ancillary Services will depend on the requirements of the System Operator, but
we expect that these services will become increasingly important due to the evolving capacity dynamic with an
increase in intermittent generation systems such as wind and solar power and a reduction in flexible capacity. To
that end, the DGEL Acquisition is consistent with our strategy to create value from flexibility and produce lowcarbon and renewable generation. The DGEL Acquisition provides us with an increased level of low-carbon and
renewable capacity, and contract-based system support revenues, providing improved earnings visibility. This

169


-----

positions Drax to capture value by supporting the System Operator in managing the impact of the UK’s transition
to a low-carbon economy, as the share of wind and solar generation increases.

We also expect to be able to participate in future Capacity Market auctions, subject to the Capacity Markets
being re-established, based on the capacity of our CCGT power stations, the Cruachan pumped storage power
plant, the Galloway hydro power plant and our coal units at Drax Power Station. In Capacity Market auctions,
participants bid for Capacity Market agreements under which they commit to generate at times of system stress.
We have Capacity Market agreements for each of our CCGT power stations, the Cruachan pumped storage plant,
the Galloway hydro power plant and our two coal-fired units at Drax Power Station, although payments under
those agreements are currently suspended. Consistent with statements made by the Government, we currently
anticipate that the Capacity Market will be re-established on the same or similar terms during 2019 and existing
Capacity Market agreements for the period to 2022 to be honoured. For further information on the Capacity
Market, see “Industry Overview—Overview of Electricity Market Reform—Capacity Market” and “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—The Capacity Market in the UK is currently suspended_
_and its future is uncertain”._

Under a Capacity Market agreement, a generator is entitled to fixed monthly payments based on a fixed
price for each kW of capacity of a generator’s generation unit subject to such Capacity Market Agreement. These
fixed payments provide guaranteed revenue in exchange for a commitment to deliver energy during a system
stress event, which occurs when the System Operator has to resort to emergency actions in order to balance
supply. Although payments under Capacity Market agreements are currently suspended, our revenue from the
Capacity Market was £3.0 million and £8.5 million for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2018,
respectively. Prior to the DGEL Acquisition, the DGEL Group received £3.9 million and £11.7 million in
Capacity Market revenues for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2018, respectively. Assuming
reinstatement of the Capacity Market on the same or similar terms as existed prior to the General Court’s
judgment, our Power Generation segment expects to receive £68 million of capacity payment revenues relating to
2019.

For further information on the Capacity Market, see “Industry Overview—Overview of Electricity Market
_Reform—Capacity Market”._

_Gas development projects_

We notified the Planning Inspectorate of our project relating to the coal-to-gas conversion of our remaining
two coal-fired generation units at Drax Power Station in September 2017. Local community consultations began
in November 2017 and continued until February 2018; these consultations discussed options including replacing
the existing c.1.3GW of coal-fired capacity from these units with up to 3.6GW of gas-fired generation capacity
(capable of running in either open cycle and combined cycle modes), a gas pipeline and up to 200MW of
supporting battery storage. These options could compete for one or more 15-year Capacity Market agreements
subject to the Capacity Market being re-established and a positive investment decision, which agreements would
guarantee revenues for Drax Power Station into the 2030s. For further information on the Capacity Market, see
“Industry Overview—Overview of Electricity Market Reform—Capacity Market”.

Our four OCGT development projects will, if any is fully developed, provide us with further gas-fired
generation capabilities. Each plant is expected to be able to provide 299MW of fast, flexible gas generation to
support the system at times of peak demand, and are able to fire up from a cold start and produce electricity in
minutes rather than hours. This rapid cold start capability can be used to provide quick response flexible
generation to support the electricity system, and to provide Ancillary Services.

A new control desk at the Damhead Creek power station will allow engineers to have real time remote
control of each plant when generation commences. The development of this project and the OCGT projects
remains subject to a positive investment decision and would require appropriate support through the Capacity
Market, if and when reinstated. There is no guarantee that we will be able to secure support for these projects
through the Capacity Market even if it is reinstated, and if not, we may choose not to develop the projects and our
initial investment could be impaired.

Our Damhead Creek site benefits from an option for the development of a second CCGT asset, Damhead
Creek II, which, if developed, would provide additional gas generation optionality for us, alongside our existing
coal-to-gas repowering and OCGT projects. Prior to the suspension of the Capacity Market, Damhead Creek II
had prequalified for the 2019 Capacity Market auction. This project would give us an additional 1.8GW of
flexible and reliable generation, subject to a positive investment decision and the award of one or more 15-year
Capacity Market agreements or similar support in future Capacity Market auctions if and when the Capacity
Market is reinstated.

_Daldowie biomass-from-waste facility_

As part of the DGEL Acquisition, we acquired a biomass-from-waste facility located in Daldowie, Scotland.
Our Daldowie facility has the capacity to produce 50,000 tonnes of dry, low-odour pellets annually, which are
currently sold under a firm offtake agreement that extends to 2026.

**_B2B Energy Supply_**

Our B2B Energy Supply segment is active in the markets for electricity and gas supply through Haven
Power (electricity) and Opus (electricity and gas). Our B2B Energy Supply segment, comprising Haven Power
and Opus, is the fifth largest supplier of electricity to businesses in the UK by volume supplied as of 31 October
2018 and supplied over 396,000 electricity and gas meters as of 31 December 2018. In 2018, the Group’s B2B
Energy Supply segment had revenues of £2,242.4 million compared to £1,999.0 million in 2017 and Adjusted
EBITDA of £28.2 million in 2018, representing 11.3 per cent. of the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA for 2018.

Our B2B Energy Supply segment supplied approximately 20.9 TWh to customers in 2018, comprising
approximately 17.9 TWh of electricity and 3.0 TWh of gas, and had a market share in the non-domestic
electricity supply sector of 11 per cent. by volume of supply as at 31 October 2018. Our B2B Energy Supply
segment provides us with a direct route to market for much of the electricity we generate. We believe that B2B
counterparties place fewer credit restrictions on us than wholesale market counterparties and selling to this
market provides us with a more diversified counterparty base with less concentrated counterparty credit risk.

The B2B market remains competitive with over 70 fully licensed suppliers across the UK market as of
31 October 2018. Our Haven and Opus businesses offer customer-centric electricity, gas and renewable products
and services, and allow customers to optimise their energy use and lower costs through the provision of insight
and digitisation tools, for example by leveraging data from installed smart meters. At the smaller microbusinessend of the market, which is closer in proximity to domestic, most of our customers are on fixed-price tariffs that
they actively review on a regular basis. Many of our larger customers are signed up to flexible contracts where
the customer either decides when to fix the price of their electricity at a given point in time or leaves it to vary
according to market prices on a day or month ahead basis.

_Haven Power_

Haven Power focuses on providing businesses with 100 per cent. renewable electricity supply contracts
from a range of simple, flexible and tailored contracts designed to meet businesses’ electricity requirements,
backed by high standards of customer service. Haven Power originally operated solely in the non-domestic SME
sector, but since 2010 started supplying customers in the I&C sector.

Haven Power acquires a significant proportion of its electricity from within the Group. This arrangement
provides a credit-efficient alternative route to market for electricity we generate and for ROCs for electricity
generated from renewable sources. It also provides Haven Power with the ability to contract for electricity on a
forward basis in a market where independent suppliers can face liquidity issues in the absence of sole-offtake
agreements.

In the SME sector, Haven Power offers contracts with diverse pricing to meet the needs and risk profile of
its SME customer base. Examples include the Haven Complete product, which has a fully fixed price designed to
provide maximum budget certainty, and the Haven Pass-Through product, which has a fixed energy cost but
passes on certain third party charges to the customer entirely. The length of the contracts generally varies from
12 to 60 months.

In addition, Haven Power offers a number of more complex flexible products in the I&C sector, which
allows the customer to choose when to lock-in their electricity prices. Customers using such products may have
the ability to fix prices for electricity for up to five years in advance or to purchase their electricity at the
prevailing market rates for the day or month ahead.

_Opus_

We acquired Opus, a UK supplier of electricity and gas with a focus on the SME market, in February 2017
for total consideration of £367.3 million.

Opus currently procures the electricity and gas it supplies to its customers from within the Group, and from
a large number of small electricity generators with whom it contracts at profitable levels compared to wholesale
rates. Some legacy transactions with other third party suppliers remain to be delivered to Opus in the future.

171


-----

Purchasing predominantly within the Group creates a credit-efficient route to market for the electricity and ROCs
generated in the Power Generation segment. In the renewable electricity purchase agreement sector, Opus offers
one- to three-year contracts to generators to purchase electricity from them. These contracts include both fixedprice arrangements and more flexible, bespoke arrangements for larger generators.

In the year ended 31 March 2018, 100 per cent. of the electricity supplied by Opus was generated from
renewable sources. Opus also buys energy from renewable generators across the UK, from sources including
wind turbines, solar panels and anaerobic digestion plants. In 2018, this amounted to 1,103 GWh of renewable
energy generated from approximately 2,000 generators.

Our B2B Energy Supply segment has an active network of TPIs, which routinely introduce new customers
to suppliers. The majority of our B2B Energy Supply segment’s customers are obtained via a network of TPIs
supported by our B2B Energy Supply Segment’s own customer services department. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to Our Business and Industry—Our reliance on TPIs and termination of relations with them might have_
_an adverse impact on our reputation and operations.”_

Opus offers business customers electricity and gas supply contracts and renewable electricity purchase
agreements on standard terms. In the SME sector, Opus offers gas and electricity contracts on a diverse price
basis to suit its customers’ risk profiles. The terms of these products range from one to four years and are
designed to pass on third party charges to customers. In the corporate sector, Opus offers electricity on a fixed
and flexible contract basis on terms of up to three years. Corporate gas customers are offered fixed-price products
only. Renewable generators are offered either a fixed or floating price for their electricity and share any
embedded benefits from savings against customer costs.

**_Pellet Production_**

Four of our generation units have been converted to burn only sustainable biomass. To support this demand,
we own and operate three wood pellet manufacturing facilities and a port export facility in the US. In 2018, our
own wood pellet facilities produced approximately 1,351,000 tonnes of sustainable biomass representing 18.0 per
cent. of our internal requirements for generation from sustainable biomass, compared to production of
approximately 822,000 tonnes being 12.3 per cent. of our internal requirements in 2017. This reflects the
successful commissioning of our third wood pellet manufacturing facility which achieved full production
capacity ahead of schedule in 2018. Accordingly, our wood pellet manufacturing facilities now have the
capability to produce at their combined annual nameplate production capacity of 1,500,000 tonnes. This capacity,
if fully utilised, would enable us to supply a greater share of our internal requirements for generation from
sustainable biomass in 2019. We aim to increase the share of internally sourced pellets to up to 30 per cent. in the
future. We continuously seek to improve our cost profile through productivity gains, carefully managed raw fibre
costs and increased asset utilisation. We aim to increase the share of internally sourced pellets to up to 30 per
cent. in the future. To further this aim, we are developing options to increase capacity at our LaSalle and
Morehouse facilities by 175,000 tonnes in aggregate by 2021.

The US operations principally seek to optimise supply chain and logistics operations of the Power
Generation segment and ensure the timely delivery of sustainable biomass fuel to Drax Power Station. The
headquarters of the Pellet Production segment is located in Monroe, Louisiana having been relocated from
Atlanta, Georgia in 2018. The operations of the Pellet Production segment are located primarily in the US Gulf
region, geographically close to both large and growing sustainably managed forests and deep-water ports to
optimise the transportation of both feedstock and biomass pellets within the US and ultimately across the Atlantic
Ocean to Drax Power Station. Our three wood pellet manufacturing facilities are all within a 200-mile radius,
allowing them to benefit from operational and logistical efficiencies. Our original two pellet manufacturing
facilities, Amite and Morehouse, are located near Bastrop, Louisiana and Gloster, Mississippi, and have a
combined annual capacity of 1,050,000 tonnes, which reflects an increase of 75,000 tonnes of production
capacity at each of these facilities in 2017. In April 2017, we successfully completed the acquisition of our
LaSalle BioEnergy facility near Urania, Louisiana. This facility has an annual nameplate capacity of 450,000
tonnes and was fully commissioned in 2018.

Wood pellets are produced from sustainably sourced biomass in the form of primary sources such as
thinnings, tops and harvesting residues sourced from the surrounding forests or secondary sources such as wood
chips, shavings or sawdust sourced from other wood-based manufacturing facilities. All our wood pellet
manufacturing facilities are certified under the Sustainable Biomass Program, an industry standard,
demonstrating that biomass is legally and sustainably sourced. Although this certification is an industry standard,
the facilities could still fulfil the sustainability specifications of the RO and CfD Schemes without this
certification if they meet certain other requirements.

172


-----

Procurement of raw materials is the main driver of costs in our Pellet Production segment. The fibre is
sourced from a range of suppliers local to the manufacturing facilities (“Fibre Basket”), with a range of contract
tenors. The plants are sited within Fibre Baskets with well-established commercial forestry operations, which
principally service the construction and manufacturing markets and provide a large amount of the lower-value
residue material typically used for sustainable wood pellets.

Wood pellets are transported by road and rail from our manufacturing facilities to our own port export
facility located on the banks of the Mississippi River in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. This export facility consists of
port-side storage and loading capabilities, on property leased from the Port of Greater Baton Rouge. The export
facility includes two 40,000 tonne storage domes, which can store pellets, arriving by road or rail, from our
manufacturing facilities and from third party suppliers. Our storage and loading facility dispatched ships to the
UK carrying approximately 1.55 million tonnes of pellets in 2018.

**Research and Development**

We take a long-term view to our business and operating environment, seeking to identify options which can
deliver value accretive growth in the future. To that end we continue to look for opportunities through research
and innovation to identify further sources of value from our core business.

173


-----

We have a long history of innovation as part of our transition away from coal to sustainable biomass. Since
2003, we have deepened our understanding of biomass combustion chemistry by investing significant resources
in scientific and technological research aimed at increasing the usable range of sustainable biomass fuels in
response to the prospective demand for such fuels. This has led to, among other things, a patented mitigant
system which injects pulverised fuel ash (which is a by-product of coal combustion and therefore readily
available) at a specific point in the combustion zone to reduce corrosion in the boilers when operating on
biomass.

In August 2016, we established a new Research and Innovation team to specifically assess how new
technology can support the sustainable growth of the Group and allow us to achieve our purpose. This team has
over 50 research and innovation streams in progress (for example, supporting the B2B Energy Supply segment
with a new technology strategy, developing options to repower our remaining coal units and identifying ways to
reduce the cost of sustainable wood pellet production in the Pellet Production segment).

We are actively progressing a series of initiatives to reduce the cost of generating electricity from biomass.
These projects include reducing the cost of biomass pellets through the use of alternative feedstocks and
upgrading the turbines on three of the biomass-fired generation units at Drax Power Station to improve the
efficiency of the station. Once fully implemented these plans will reduce our reliance on subsidies and preserve
the life of Drax Power Station beyond 2027.

We are strengthening our ties with academia and work with a number of universities in the UK. We are also
funding postgraduate research at Sheffield University’s Centre for Doctoral Training, covering topics such as
vehicle-to-grid electricity systems, reciprocating engine emissions clean-up technology and future battery
technology. We continue to work across all parts of the Group to maintain and enhance our position as one of the
world’s leading authorities on large-scale carbon neutral sustainable biomass generation. In recent years, we have
worked on the commercial development of sustainable biomass technology in large-scale industrial coal plants,
working towards safe and reliable production of electricity from sustainable biomass and the wider resource,
infrastructure and supply chain innovations that contribute to improved technology and reduced costs.

We have also developed alternate low carbon technologies that continue to offer low-cost, low-emissions
generation capacity to meet the UK’s changing energy needs.

In May 2018, we started Europe’s first Bioenergy Carbon Capture and Storage pilot project at Drax Power
Station. The process involves the deployment of a proprietary solvent to isolate the carbon dioxide from the flue
gases released when biomass is used to generate electricity, and is the first-time carbon dioxide has been captured
from the combustion of 100 per cent. biomass feedstock anywhere in the world. While at an early stage, the
project is capturing one tonne of CO2 per day and offers the potential for biomass to deliver carbon negative
generation, which will be required if the UK is to achieve its decarbonisation targets, further supporting the case
for biomass generation in the long-term.

**Environment**

_Environmental performance of Drax Power Station_

We strive towards reducing our impact on the environment and regard compliance with legislative and
regulatory requirements as the minimum level of achievement. Fossil fuel-derived CO2 emissions from Drax
Power Station fell from 22.7 million tonnes in 2012 to 4.1 million tonnes in 2018.

EU environmental legislation, notably the IED, imposes limits on, among other things, emissions of SO2 and
NOx from our generation units.

Effective January 2016, the IED sets an annual limit on the amount of NOx and SO2 that we can emit from
Drax Power Station. We must either ensure that our coal and biomass units operate within this limit or else
purchase additional emissions allowances from other generators equal to the shortfall.

Drax Power Station is also subject to short-term (24-hourly and monthly) emission limit values for SO2,
NOx and particulate matter. These limits reflect achievable emissions rates from plants such as Drax Power
Station, and Drax Power Station has been, and expects to remain, materially compliant with them. Additionally,
we are focused on meeting the requirements of the Best Available Techniques Reference document for Large
Combustion Plants developed under the IED that will further reduce air emission limits when it enters into force
no later than mid-2021.

The FGD system is designed to remove approximately 90 per cent. of SO2 emissions, enabling Drax Power
Station to operate within the SO2 emissions restrictions of the IED and to efficiently burn a mixture of fuels,

174


-----

including coal, sustainable biomass and petroleum coke, in a manner that satisfies environmental requirements.
NOx emissions are reduced further through the boosted over-fire air technology that is fitted on the boilers,
allowing Drax Power Station to operate within the NOx restrictions of the IED. In addition, five of Drax Power
Station’s six generation units have been fitted with selective non-catalytic reduction technology. The installation
of this new equipment, together with the increased use of sustainable biomass and low-NOx coal as well as lower
electricity output, contributed to a 62 per cent. reduction in NOx emissions from Drax Power Station in 2018
compared to 2015.

By-products of the coal-combustion and FGD operations such as ash and gypsum are sold to the
construction industry, which both reduces disposal costs and creates revenue. Ash can also be used as mitigant to
be fed into Drax Power Station’s boilers along with biomass to reduce corrosion and slagging.

For further information, see “Industry Overview—Electricity Market: regulatory context—Capacity
_constraints”._

_Environmental performance and compliance_

During 2018, we continued to increase the amount of sustainable biomass burnt in place of coal and
significantly reduced our carbon footprint, having completed the conversion of our fourth generation unit to burn
sustainable biomass in August 2018. Of the 18.3TWh we generated in 2018, 75 per cent. was generated from
burning sustainable biomass. Thus we achieved our goal of predominantly generating electricity using
sustainable biomass.

We are required to disclose emissions from biologically sequestered carbon, which includes emissions
released through burning sustainable biomass to generate electricity (13,019kt in 2018 and 12,196kt in 2017).
This rise in emissions from biologically sequestered carbon is due to our strategy to generate more electricity
through sustainable biomass-fuelled generators rather than coal-fuelled generators.

Environmental compliance at Drax Power Station and associated landfill site is managed through an
environmental management system that is externally certified to the international standard ISO 14001. It is
audited twice every year. There have been no material breaches of our environmental consents in the last three
years.

Environmental compliance at our hydro assets is managed through the Controlled Activities Regulations
2011, commonly referred to as CAR. Our hydro assets have achieved an “Excellent” rating (the highest
achievable) for each of 2016 and 2017, the last two published years. For further information on CAR, see “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Our cost of compliance with environmental laws and_
_regulations, as well as costs to address any environmental liabilities arising from our operating activities, could_
_have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of_
_operations”. Our CCGT power stations are managed through an environmental management system which is_
externally certified to the international standard ISO14001.

**Health and Safety**

We are committed to ensuring a safe working environment. In 2018, our safety statistics for Drax Group
(excluding DGEL) demonstrated good performance, with a 0.09 lost time injury rate (lost time injuries / hours
worked x 100,000), and a 0.22 total recordable injury rate ((lost time injuries + worse than first aid injuries) /
hours worked x 100,000), compared to a 0.22 and 0.27 total recordable injury rate in 2016 and 2017 respectively.
In 2018, calculated on the same basis, DGEL achieved a lost time injury rate of 0.16 and a total recordable injury
rate of 0.31 which represented two recordable injuries.

We retained our certification for the Health and Safety Management System to the internationally
recognised Occupational Health and Safety Standard, OHSAS 18001, at Drax Power Station. The standard is
approved by Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance. Our US operations are working toward implementing
integrated management systems ISO 9000 and 14000 to ensure employees operate in a safe working
environment, and at Drax Biomass the safety management systems will meet the US certification ANSI Z10.

In addition, in 2018, Drax Power Station was awarded the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents
President’s Award (RoSPA) for outstanding performance in health and safety at work over the course of 2017.
This is Drax’s 14[th] consecutive year of RoSPA awards for outstanding performance in health and safety at work,
having received 10 Gold Awards and 4 President’s Awards. Safety performance is reported and reviewed
regularly by local management teams, the Drax Group plc executive committee and the Board. Each incident is
comprehensively analysed and reviewed, lessons learnt are shared with the employees and actions are taken to

mitigate against future occurrences. At Drax Power Station, a weekly safety update is uploaded to our intranet
and at Drax Biomass, information is made available to employees through a dedicated environment, health and
safety (EHS) online portal.

**Insurance**

We have in place insurance policies with major insurance companies covering items such as property
damage and business interruption, third party liability, credit risk in respect of larger customers (at Opus only),
terrorism, marine cargo, charterers and other financial risks such as commercial crime and pension trustee
liability. These insurance policies are maintained at a level that we believe is reasonable. In November 2018, we
agreed a £26 million settlement in respect of insurance claims in respect of (i) a longer than anticipated planned
outage of one of our biomass-fired generation units in the second half of 2016, (ii) a pressure excursion on one of
our biomass storage silos in October 2016, (iii) an unplanned outage in respect of one of Drax Power Station’s
biomass-fired generation units in the second half of 2016, (iv) an incident in respect of the biomass rail unloading
system at Drax Power Station in December 2017, and (v) an unplanned outage in respect of one of Drax Power
Station’s biomass-fired generation units in February 2018. We are considering a number of minor insurance
claims relating to outages at certain of our facilities.

**Employees**

As of 31 December 2018, we employed 2,716 people, an increase of approximately 6.2 per cent. compared
to the previous year, reflecting the enlarged Group following the DGEL Acquisition. Most of the workforce is
employed full time on permanent contracts. The number of employees by business segment as at 31 December
2018 are shown below:

**Licences**

Our UK operating companies hold a number of licences issued by Ofgem relating to their activities in the
UK energy sector, most notably:

Drax Power and DGEL hold generation licences in respect of their generation activities. These licences
contain, among other things, provisions relating to compliance with the Grid Code, the Connection and Use of
System Code, the Balancing and Settlement Code and other industry codes and requirements to offer terms for
the provision of Ancillary Services when requested to do so by the System Operator (albeit with no requirement
to offer services at a price which is uneconomical). Drax Power also holds a gas shipper licence to enable it to
trade gas in wholesale markets.

Both companies in our B2B Energy Supply segment hold licences for the supply of electricity to their
customers. These licences contain, among other things, provisions relating to compliance with industry codes and
customer interactions, including the provision of certain information to customers and a general duty to treat
certain of their customers fairly in relation to specific designated activities.

Opus holds licences for the shipping and supply of gas to its customers. The gas shipper licence enables it to
trade gas in wholesale markets. The supply licence contains, among other things, provisions relating to
compliance with industry codes and customer interactions, including the provision of certain information to
customers and a general duty to treat certain of their customers fairly in relation to specific designated activities.

**Corporate Social Responsibility**

We are a UK member of UN Global Compact (UNGC), an organisation promoting responsible corporate
citizenship to realise a sustainable and inclusive global economy and have established representation on both
their UK Advisory Group and Modern Slavery Working Group. This membership and representation will enable
us to play an active role in the UK UNGC network, to benchmark our compliance programmes, to share and
exchange experience and promote peer collaboration.

**Competition**

For competitive conditions with respect to our business, see “Industry Overview—Evolution of the Big Six”
and “Industry Overview—Supply”.

**Legal Proceedings**

We are routinely involved in a number of lawsuits in the ordinary course of business involving employment,
commercial, intellectual property, environmental, and personal injuries and damages issues, among other matters.
We are currently not involved in any legal or administrative proceeding which we believe would reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results
of operations.

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS**

_The following summary of the material terms of certain financing arrangements to which certain members_
_of the Group are a party does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by_
_reference to, the underlying documents. For further information regarding our existing indebtedness, see “Use of_
_Proceeds” and “Capitalisation”._

_Capitalised terms used in this section that are not otherwise defined in “Definitions” or “Business and_
_Industry Glossary” shall have the meanings assigned to them in this section, except that, for the avoidance of_
_doubt, the “Notes” will be described as the “Notes the subject of the Offering”._

Certain members of the Group have entered into financing arrangements, which are summarised below.

**2022 Notes**

**Overview**

On 5 May 2017 the Issuer issued £350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.250% senior secured notes
due 2022 (the “2022 Notes”). The 2022 Notes were issued under an indenture dated as of 5 May 2017, as
amended and restated from time to time (the “2022 Indenture”), in a private transaction that was not subject to
the registration requirements of the US Securities Act. The 2022 Indenture was not qualified under, or subject to,
the US Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

The 2022 Notes will mature on 1 May 2022. The 2022 Notes were issued in minimum denominations of
£100,000 and in integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof. The 2022 Notes are listed on the Official List of
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market thereof.

The 2022 Notes are currently guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Guarantors. The 2022 Notes and
the guarantees thereof are secured by first priority liens on the Collateral. The 2022 Notes may be secured by
further security interests from time to time subject to certain Agreed Security Principles set out in the Senior
Facilities Agreement. See “—Senior Facilities Agreement—Agreed Security Principles”.

The 2022 Indenture and the 2022 Notes are subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. See
“—Intercreditor Agreement” for a description of certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

**Description of the 2022 Notes and 2022 Note Guarantees**

**_The 2022 Notes_**

The 2022 Notes are general senior obligations of the Issuer and:

   - rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future obligations of the Issuer that are not
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2022 Notes, including indebtedness incurred under the
Senior Facilities Agreement and certain Hedging Obligations (including the obligations under the Secured
Trading Line);

   - are senior in right of payment to all existing and future obligations of the Issuer that are expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the 2022 Notes;

   - are secured by the same Collateral that on and from the Issue Date the Notes the subject of the Offering
will be secured by, and like the Holders of the Notes the subject of the Offering, the Holders of the 2022
Notes will only receive proceeds from the enforcement over the Collateral and certain distressed disposals
after certain obligations of DGHL and its Subsidiaries, including the indebtedness under the Senior
Facilities Agreement and certain hedging obligations (including the obligations under the Secured
Trading Line), have been repaid and discharged in full;

   - are effectively subordinated to any existing and future obligations of the Issuer that are secured by
property or assets that do not secure the 2022 Notes, to the extent of the value of the property and assets
securing such obligations; and

   - are structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations of the non-Guarantor Subsidiaries of
DGHL.

The 2022 Notes are subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Under the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of an enforcement of the Collateral, the Holders of the 2022 Notes will
receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral or from certain distressed disposals of the Collateral pari

185


-----

_passu with the Holders of the Notes the subject of the Offering and only after (i) the lenders under the Senior_
Facilities Agreement, (ii) counterparties to certain hedging obligations (including the obligations under the
Secured Trading Line), (iii) lenders or creditors under certain other Indebtedness permitted to be incurred on a
super priority basis under the 2022 Indenture (including any indebtedness that refinances the Senior Facilities
Agreement) and (iv) certain amounts owing to the Security Agent, any receiver and certain creditor
representatives (including the trustee in relation to the 2022 Notes) have been repaid in full. See “—Intercreditor
_Agreement”._

The 2022 Notes are guaranteed by the Guarantors on a senior secured basis.

**_Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, all of DGHL’s Subsidiaries are “Restricted Subsidiaries” for
purposes of the 2022 Indenture. In certain circumstances, the Issuer is permitted to designate certain of its
Subsidiaries as further “Unrestricted Subsidiaries”. Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer are not subject to any
of the restrictive covenants in the 2022 Indenture. Further, any future Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer
would not guarantee the 2022 Notes.

Certain Restricted Subsidiaries, which include Drax Biomass Holdings Limited, Drax Holdings Limited,
Drax Pension Trustees Limited, Drax Group Project Services Limited, Drax CCS Limited, Drax Generation
(Selby) Limited, Abergelli Power Limited, Hirwaun Power Limited, Millbrook Power Limited, Pike Bioenergy
LLC Progress Power Limited, Opus Energy Marketing Limited, Opus Gas Limited, Select Energy Limited,
Domus Energy Limited, Opus Water Limited and SMW Limited do not guarantee the 2022 Notes or the Initial
Notes and will not guarantee the New Notes that are the subject of the Offering. It is possible that such Restricted
Subsidiaries may guarantee the 2022 Notes (and the New Notes that are the subject of the Offering) in the future.

**_Interest_**

Interest on the 2022 Notes accrues at a rate of 4.250 per cent. per annum and is payable in cash semiannually in arrear on 1 May and 1 November of each year.

**_Prepayments and Redemptions_**

At any time prior to 1 May 2019, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 40 per cent. of
the original principal amount of the 2022 Notes, subject to the terms of, and at the redemption prices specified in,
the 2022 Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional tax amounts to the redemption date, with the
proceeds of an equity offering provided that:

(1) at least 60 per cent. of the original principal amount of the 2022 Notes issued under the 2022
Indenture remain outstanding after each such redemption; and

(2) the redemption occurs within 180 days after the closing of such equity offering.

At any time prior to 1 May 2019, the Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, part of the 2022 Notes,
subject to the terms of the 2022 Indenture, and at a redemption price equal to 100 per cent. of the principal
amount of the 2022 Notes, plus the applicable premium plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional tax
amounts to the redemption date.

On and after 1 May 2019, the Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, part of the 2022 Notes, subject to
the terms of, and at the redemption prices specified in, the 2022 Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
additional tax amounts to the redemption date.

**_Optional Redemption upon Certain Tender Offers_**

In connection with any tender offer for, or other offer to purchase, all of the 2022 Notes, in the event that
holders of not less than 90 per cent. of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 2022 Notes validly
tender and do not validly withdraw such 2022 Notes in such tender offer or offer to purchase and the Issuer or a
third party making such tender offer or offer to purchase all the 2022 Notes held by such holders, within 60 days
of such purchase, the Issuer will have the right, upon not less than 10 and no more than 60 days’ prior notice, to
redeem all (but not less than all) the 2022 Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a redemption
price equal to the highest price (excluding any early tender premium or similar payment) paid to each other
holder in such tender offer or offer to purchase, plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer or offer to
purchase payment, accrued and unpaid interest to the date of such redemption.

186


-----

**_Change of Control_**

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a Change of Control (as defined in the 2022 Indenture),
the Issuer may be required to make an offer to repurchase the 2022 Notes at a redemption price equal to 101 per
cent. of the principal amount of the 2022 Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional tax
amounts to the date of purchase.

**_Redemption for Taxation Reasons_**

The Issuer may redeem the 2022 Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time in certain circumstances if the
Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of any change in tax law in any applicable tax jurisdiction, the
Issuer would become obligated to pay additional amounts on payments on the 2022 Notes.

**_General_**

Subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement), the
Issuer may repurchase 2022 Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or otherwise.

If the Issuer effects an optional redemption of any 2022 Notes, it will, for so long as such 2022 Notes are
listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, inform
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange of such optional redemption and confirm the aggregate principal amount of the
2022 Notes that will remain outstanding immediately after such redemption.

**_Covenants and Events of Default_**

The 2022 Indenture contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain
exceptions, the ability of DGHL, the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries to:

(1) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;

(2) make investments or other restricted payments;

(3) pay dividends or make other distributions or purchase or redeem stock;

(4) enter into agreements that restrict the Restricted Subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends;

(5) transfer or sell assets;

(6) engage in transactions with affiliates;

(7) create or permit to exist liens on assets to secure indebtedness; and

(8) impair or consolidate with or into another company.

Each of these covenants is subject to significant exceptions and qualifications.

In addition, the 2022 Indenture imposes certain requirements as to future subsidiary guarantors, including an
affirmative undertaking in relation to guarantor coverage (by reference to 80 per cent. of consolidated EBITDA
and our consolidated total assets), subject to certain exceptions, and contains certain customary events of default.

**_Governing Law_**

The 2022 Indenture and the 2022 Notes, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder, will be governed
by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

**Initial Notes**

On 26 April 2018, the Issuer issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.625% Senior Secured
Notes due 2025 (the “Initial Notes” and, together with the New Notes, the “Notes”). The Initial Notes were
issued under an indenture dated as of 26 April 2018, as amended and restated from time to time (the
“Indenture”), in a private transaction that was not subject to the registration requirements of the US Securities
Act. The Indenture was not qualified under, or subject to, the US Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

The Initial Notes will mature on 1 November 2025. The Initial Notes were issued in minimum
denominations of $200,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Initial Notes are listed on
the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market thereof.

The Initial Notes are currently guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Guarantors. The Initial Notes
may be secured by further security interests from time to time subject to certain Agreed Security Principles set

187


-----

out in the Senior Facilities Agreement. See “—Senior Facilities Agreement—Agreed Security Principles”.
Certain Restricted Subsidiaries do not guarantee the Initial Notes or the 2022 Notes and will not guarantee the
New Notes that are the subject of the Offering. It is possible that such Restricted Subsidiaries may guarantee the
Initial Notes (and the New Notes that are the subject of the Offering) in the future. See “—2022 Notes—
_Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries”._

The Indenture and the Initial Notes are subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. See
“—Intercreditor Agreement” for a description of certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

For a description of the Initial Notes, see “Description of the Notes”.

**Senior Facilities Agreement**

We entered into a revolving credit facility agreement on 20 December 2012 between, among others, Drax
Power, Barclays Bank PLC as facility agent and Drax Corporate Limited which was amended and restated
pursuant to an amendment and restatement agreement on 21 April 2017, with effect from 5 May 2017 (as
amended and restated, the “Senior Facilities Agreement”). The Senior Facilities Agreement comprises a
£315 million committed multicurrency working capital and ancillary facility, including, without limitation, a
letter of credit facility (the “Revolving Facility”) and a £35 million term facility (the “Term Loan”). The
Revolving Facility can be drawn in pound sterling, euro or US dollars. The Term Loan was fully drawn on 5 May
2017.

The original borrower under the Senior Facilities Agreement is Drax Corporate Limited. The Senior
Facilities Agreement provides for the flexibility of acceding (and subsequently resigning) subsidiaries of DGHL
incorporated in the UK or in the US (subject to certain customary conditions) as additional borrowers.

**_Purpose_**

Each loan under the Revolving Facility may be used (i) to provide cash collateral in favour of certain
permitted counterparties; (ii) to provide cash cover in favour of an issuing bank of a letter of credit or in respect
of an ancillary facility under the Senior Facilities Agreement; and (iii) for the other general corporate purposes of
the Group, including, but not limited to, financing working capital requirements. There is a separate sub-limit of
£200 million on cash drawings for general corporate purposes under limb (iii) above.

**_Interest and Fees_**

Interest is payable under the Revolving Facility at a rate of LIBOR or, in the case of loans in euro,
EURIBOR (in each case subject to a zero floor) plus the applicable margin. Save for in circumstances where an
event of default has occurred and is continuing or the borrower has failed to notify the facility agent of a change
in rating, the applicable margin is determined by reference to a ratings matrix, ranging from a maximum of
2.75 per cent. where the rating of the debt incurred under the Revolving Facility is BB-/Ba3 or lower to a
minimum of 1.25 per cent. where such rating is BBB/Baa2 or higher.

A commitment fee is payable quarterly in arrear on the available but unused commitments under the
Revolving Facility at a rate of 35 per cent. of the applicable margin. A utilisation fee is payable quarterly in
arrear at a rate of (i) 0.20 per cent. per annum for each day on which the aggregate amount of the utilised
commitments under the Revolving Facility exceeds 50 per cent. of the total commitments under the Revolving
Facility; or (ii) 0.40 per cent. per annum for each day on which the aggregate amount of the utilised
commitments under the Revolving Facility exceeds 75 per cent. of the total commitments under the Revolving
Facility.

Interest is payable under the Term Loan at a rate calculated by multiplying a fixed rate of 4.158 per cent. per
annum by the index ratio applicable to the relevant interest payment date multiplied by the outstanding principal
amount of the Term Loan. The relevant index for calculation of the index ratio is the Non-revised Retail Price
Index All Items in the United Kingdom as published by the Office of National Statistics.

**_Availability and Maturity_**

The Revolving Facility is available to be drawn until one month prior to the final maturity date and letters of
credit may be issued up until the final maturity date (in each case, as such may be extended). The Revolving
Facility has an initial maturity date of 30 April 2021, with an option to extend to 30 April 2022. The Term Loan
has a maturity date of 31 March 2022.

188


-----

The Revolving Facility may be utilised by way of letter of credit, reducing the amount available for cash
drawings under the Revolving Facility by an amount equivalent to the letters of credit issued.

**_Prepayment_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement contains customary provisions for the prepayment and cancellation of a
particular lender’s commitments in the case of a defaulting lender, additional payments being charged for tax
reasons or increased costs.

Subject to certain conditions, the borrowers under the Revolving Facility may voluntarily prepay their
utilisations or permanently cancel all or part of the available commitments under the Revolving Facility.
Amounts voluntarily prepaid may be re-borrowed during the availability period applicable to the Revolving
Facility. Subject to certain conditions, the borrower of the Term Loan may voluntarily prepay all or part of the
Term Loan at an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid multiplied by the index ratio as at the relevant
prepayment date, plus a make-whole amount (as described below).

Subject to certain thresholds and other qualifications, there are mandatory prepayments required to be made
in respect of the Senior Facilities upon the occurrence of certain events such as change of control, illegality and
sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Group. The Senior Facilities Agreement also contains provisions
for mandatory prepayment on the occurrence of a Note Purchase Condition, as described below. There is also a
mandatory prepayment required to be made in respect of the Term Loan in the event that the applicable index
ceases to be published and no appropriate successor index can be determined. The applicable make-whole
amount, as described further below, is payable in respect of prepayments under the Term Loan.

The Senior Facilities Agreement provides that no members of the Group may repay, purchase, defease or
redeem (or otherwise retire for value) any of the 2022 Notes using the proceeds of an Asset Disposition unless:

   - either:

O the aggregate principal amount of all 2022 Notes prepaid, purchased, defeased, redeemed (or
otherwise retired for value) or acquired since the issue date of those notes (5 May 2017) is less
than or equal to 50 per cent. of the aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes issued as of the
issue date; or

O to the extent that members of the Group make prepayments, purchases, defeasances, redemptions
(or other retirements for value) or acquisitions that in the aggregate exceed 50 per cent. of the
aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes issued as of the issue date of those notes, the Group
is obligated to match the prepayment, purchase, defeasance, redemption (or other retirement for
value) by a simultaneous cancellation and, if necessary, repayment of an equal amount under the
Senior Facilities Agreement in order that the total commitments under the Senior Facilities
Agreement are reduced by the same proportion as the debt so repurchased relative to aggregate
principal amount of 2022 Notes issued as of the issue date; and

   - no default continuing or resulting from the prepayment, purchase, defeasance, redemption (or other
retirement for value).

The applicable make-whole amount in respect of prepayments under the Term Loan is calculated by
reference to the excess, if any, of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and
interest under the Term Loan with respect to the principal amount prepaid, over the amount of such principal
prepaid. The applicable discount factor is calculated by reference to the applicable percentage (which is
determined by reference to the nature of the relevant prepayment) plus the yield to maturity of the specified
reference gilt.

**_Undertakings and Covenants_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement contains certain negative undertakings that are substantially similar to
those in the 2022 Indenture governing the 2022 Notes. The Senior Facilities Agreement also contains customary
negative covenants, subject to certain agreed exceptions, including, but not limited to, (i) restrictions on change
of business, (ii) centre of main interests, (iii) share capital, (iv) purchase or redemption of the 2022 Notes,
(v) activities of DGHL, (vi) incurrence of certain indebtedness by non-obligor subsidiaries, (vii) certain disposals
of assets to non-obligor subsidiaries, (viii) change to Drax Group plc’s year end, and (ix) parameters of the
Secured Trade Line. The Senior Facilities Agreement also requires each obligor to observe certain affirmative
undertakings subject to materiality and other customary and agreed exceptions.

189


-----

These affirmative undertakings include, but are not limited to, undertakings related to (i) compliance with
relevant laws, rules and regulations (including environmental, sanctions and anti-corruption), (ii) payment of
taxes, (iii) the delivery of certain financial statements, (iv) information reporting obligations in respect of the
Secured Trading Line, (v) rating, (vi) notice of default and material litigation, (vii) right to request information
relating to our financial condition, (viii) insurance, (ix) maintenance of assets, and (x) compliance with and
maintenance of material authorisations. There is also an affirmative undertaking in relation to guarantor coverage
(by reference to 85 per cent. of consolidated EBITDA and our consolidated total assets), subject to certain
exceptions.

The Senior Facilities Agreement also requires us to ensure compliance with a financial covenant requiring
our consolidated EBITDA for the prior 12-month period to be no less than £170 million as at any applicable
semi-annual testing date. This covenant will be tested only where either: (i) drawings of cash within the
£200 million sub-limit on cash drawings for general corporate purposes described above are 25 per cent. or more
of the total commitments as at the relevant semi-annual testing date; or (ii) any Term Loan is outstanding.

**_Events of Default_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement contains customary events of default (subject in certain cases to agreed
thresholds, grace periods and qualifications), including non-payment, breach of other obligations,
misrepresentation, cross-default, insolvency, insolvency proceedings, creditors’ process, cessation of business,
effectiveness of finance documents, ownership of obligors and proceedings. In addition to these customary
events of default, the Senior Facilities Agreement contains events of default reflective of the nature of our
business, relating to the generation licence granted to Drax Power pursuant to the Electricity Act 1989,
nationalisation, and the Secured Trading Line. At any time after the occurrence of an event of default, the facility
agent may, and on the instruction of majority lenders must, cancel all or any part of the total commitments and/or
declare that amounts outstanding are immediately due and payable and/or payable on demand. In addition, after
the occurrence of an event of default following a breach of the financial covenant described above, the lenders
under the Term Loan and the majority lenders under the Revolving Facility each have a separate right (in respect
of the Term Loan and the Revolving Facility, respectively) to cancel all or any part of the commitments and/or
declare that amounts outstanding are immediately due and payable and/or payable on demand.

**_Security, Guarantee and Indemnity_**

The Senior Facilities are secured by the same Collateral as for the 2022 Notes, the Initial Notes, the New
Notes and the 2018 Bridge Facility as set out under “Description of Notes—Security”.

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the proceeds from any distressed disposal and from any
enforcement of the Collateral will be applied to repayment of the Senior Facilities and certain hedging
obligations (including our obligations under the Secured Trading Line) in priority to repayment of the 2022
Notes, the Initial Notes and the New Notes).

The provision and the terms of the Collateral will in all cases be subject to certain limitations and are at all
times and in all cases subject to the requirements of applicable law and the other matters set out in the Senior
Facilities Agreement. Please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and Our Capital
_Structure—Each Guarantee and security interest is subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be_
_limited by applicable law or subject to certain defences that may limit its validity and enforceability”._

The Senior Facilities are guaranteed by the Guarantors (other than Drax Corporate Limited) and the Issuer.
Each guarantor under the Senior Facilities Agreement irrevocably and unconditionally jointly and severally:

   - guarantees to each finance party punctual performance by each other obligor of all that obligor’s
obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement;

   - undertakes with each finance party that whenever another obligor does not pay any amount when due
under or in connection with any finance document relating to the Senior Facilities Agreement, that
Guarantor shall immediately on demand pay that amount as if it were the principal obligor; and

   - indemnifies each finance party immediately on demand against any cost, loss or liability suffered by that
finance party if any amount claimed by a finance party under the guarantee is not recoverable from the
guarantor on the basis of the guarantee. The amount of the cost, loss or liability shall be equal to the
amount which that finance party would otherwise have been entitled to recover.

190


-----

**_Governing Law_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement is governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with English law,
although the incurrence covenants contained therein, which largely replicate the relevant covenants from the
2022 Notes, shall be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

**_Agreed Security Principles_**

The Agreed Security Principles embody recognition by all parties to the Senior Facilities Agreement that
there may be certain legal and practical difficulties in obtaining security and guarantees from all the guarantors
under the Senior Facilities Agreement in every jurisdiction in which such guarantors are incorporated. The
Agreed Security Principles provide that guarantees will not be given and security shall not be granted in certain
circumstances, in particular to the extent that:

   - it would result in a breach of general statutory limitations, financial assistance, corporate benefit,
fraudulent preference, “thin capitalisation”, “earnings stripping”, “controlled foreign corporation”,
transfer pricing, capital maintenance, retention of title claims and similar principles, laws or regulations;

   - it would result in costs (including tax disadvantages) to the Group that would be disproportionate to the
benefit accruing to the secured parties;

   - the relevant assets are subject to third party arrangements which prevent those assets from being charged
or would give a third party termination or other rights in respect of arrangements relating to those assets;
or

   - it is not within the legal capacity of the relevant member of the Group or would conflict with any relevant
fiduciary duties or contravene any legal or regulatory prohibition.

The Agreed Security Principles also set out certain additional factors which will apply when determining the
extent of the guarantees and the security to be provided and certain additional principles which will be reflected
in any security taken.

**2018 Bridge Facility**

We entered into an acquisition bridge facility agreement on 16 October 2018 between, among others, Drax
Corporate Limited as borrower, Barclays Bank PLC as facility agent and Drax Group Holdings Limited as
original guarantor, which was amended and restated pursuant to an amendment and restatement agreement on
21 December 2018 (as amended and restated, the “2018 Bridge Facility Agreement”). The 2018 Bridge Facility
Agreement comprises a £725 million committed acquisition facility, including, without limitation, a certain funds
facility for the purposes of the DGEL Acquisition (the “Bridge Facility”). The 2018 Bridge Facility can only be
drawn in pound sterling. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, Drax Corporate Limited had drawn
£550 million under the 2018 Bridge Facility. In connection with the Offering, we expect to partially repay
amounts outstanding under the 2018 Bridge Facility in an amount equal to £154.1 million (assuming an issuance
at par). Following the Offering, we expect to have £395.9 million outstanding under the 2018 Bridge Facility.
Following the Offering, we expect to refinance the remaining portion of indebtedness under the 2018 Bridge
Facility Agreement during 2019. See “Capitalisation”.

**_Purpose_**

Each loan under the 2018 Bridge Facility may be used (i) to finance the DGEL Acquisition and related
acquisition costs; and (ii) for the other general corporate purposes of the Group. There is a separate sub-limit of
£75 million on cash drawings for general corporate purposes under limb (ii) above.

**_Interest and Fees_**

Interest is payable under the 2018 Bridge Facility at a rate of LIBOR (subject to a zero floor) plus the
applicable margin. The margin will step up after three, six, 12 and 17 months following the first date of
utilisation of the 2018 Bridge Facility (31 December 2018), beginning at 0.75 per cent. per annum and increasing
to 2.5 per cent. per annum after 17 months. The applicable margin will increase by an additional 0.25 per cent.
per annum if at any point both Fitch and S&P assign a rating of BB or lower in respect of DGHL’s secured longterm debt.

A ticking fee is payable quarterly in arrear on the available but unused commitments under the 2018 Bridge
Facility at a rate of up to 30 per cent. of the applicable margin. If the maturity date is extended up to a maximum
of 19 months after the first utilisation date (i.e. 31 July 2020), an extension fee payable on 31 December 2019 of
0.25 per cent. of each of the lender’s drawn and undrawn commitments on 31 December 2019.

**_Availability and Maturity_**

All remaining commitments under the 2018 Bridge Facility have been cancelled. The 2018 Bridge Facility
has an initial maturity date of 31 December 2019, with an option to extend to 31 July 2020.

**_Prepayment_**

The 2018 Bridge Facility Agreement contains customary provisions for the prepayment and cancellation of
a particular lender’s commitments in the case of a defaulting lender, additional payments being charged for tax
reasons or increased costs.

Subject to certain conditions, the borrower under the 2018 Bridge Facility may voluntarily prepay its
utilisations or permanently cancel all or part of the available commitments under the 2018 Bridge Facility.
Amounts voluntarily prepaid may not be re-borrowed during the availability period applicable to the 2018 Bridge
Facility.

Subject to certain thresholds and other qualifications, there are mandatory prepayments required to be made
in respect of the 2018 Bridge Facility Agreement upon the occurrence of certain events such as change of control,
illegality and sale of all or substantially all of the assets of DGHL and its Restricted Subsidiaries. The 2018
Bridge Facility Agreement also contains provisions for mandatory prepayment of the net proceeds arising from
any equity raise, debt capital markets issuance or loan financing by any of DGHL and its Restricted Subsidiaries
(except as specifically provided for) and makes provision for mandatory prepayment in the amount of
consideration received in excess of £75 million for a single asset disposition or £150 million in aggregate from
asset dispositions and in respect of recovery claims made against the former shareholder of DGEL or any of its
affiliates in relation for the DGEL Acquisition Agreement.

**_Undertakings and Covenants_**

The 2018 Bridge Facility Agreement contains certain negative undertakings that are substantially similar to
those in the 2022 Indenture governing the 2022 Notes. The 2018 Bridge Facility Agreement also contains
customary negative covenants, subject to certain agreed exceptions, including, but not limited to, (i) restrictions
on change of business, (ii) centre of main interests, (iii) share capital, (iv) activities of DGHL, (vi) incurrence of
certain indebtedness by non-obligor subsidiaries and (vii) change to DGHL and Drax Group plc’s year end. The
2018 Bridge Facility Agreement also requires each obligor to observe certain affirmative undertakings subject to
materiality and other customary and agreed exceptions.

These affirmative undertakings include, but are not limited to, undertakings related to (i) compliance with
relevant laws, rules and regulations (including environmental, sanctions and anti-corruption), (ii) payment of
taxes, (iii) the delivery of certain financial statements, (iv) rating, (v) notice of default and material litigation,
(vi) right to receive information relating to our financial condition that it provided to certain other creditors,
(vii) insurance, (viii) maintenance of assets, and (ix) compliance with and maintenance of material
authorisations.

**_Events of Default_**

The 2018 Bridge Facility Agreement contains customary events of default (subject in certain cases to agreed
thresholds, grace periods and qualifications), including non-payment, breach of other obligations,
misrepresentation, cross-default, insolvency, insolvency proceedings, creditors’ process, cessation of business,
effectiveness of finance documents, ownership of obligors and proceedings. In addition to these customary
events of default, the 2018 Bridge Facility Agreement contains events of default reflective of the nature of our
business, relating to the generation licence granted to Drax Power pursuant to the Electricity Act 1989 and
nationalisation. At any time after the occurrence of an event of default, the facility agent may, and on the
instruction of majority lenders must, cancel all or any part of the total commitments and/or declare that amounts
outstanding are immediately due and payable and/or payable on demand and/or exercise or direct the security
agent to exercise any or all of its rights, remedies, powers or discretions under the finance documents.

**_Security, Guarantee and Indemnity_**

The 2018 Bridge Facility is secured by the same Collateral as for the New Notes, the 2022 Notes, the Initial
Notes and the Senior Facilities as set out under “Description of Notes—Security”.

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the proceeds from any distressed disposal and from any
enforcement of the Collateral will be applied to repayment of the 2018 Bridge Facility pari passu with the holders

192


-----

of the New Notes, the 2022 Notes and the Initial Notes and only after certain other creditors, including the
lenders under the Senior Facilities and counterparties to certain hedging obligations (including our obligations
under the Secured Trading Line) have been repaid in full.

The provision and the terms of the Collateral will in all cases be subject to certain limitations and are at all
times and in all cases subject to the requirements of applicable law and the other matters set out in the 2018
Bridge Facility Agreement. Please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and Our
_Capital Structure—Each Guarantee and security interest is subject to certain limitations on enforcement and_
_may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defences that may limit its validity and enforceability”._

The 2018 Bridge Facility is guaranteed by the Guarantors and the Issuer. Each guarantor under the 2018
Bridge Facility Agreement irrevocably and unconditionally jointly and severally:

   - guarantees to each finance party punctual performance by each other obligor of all that obligor’s
obligations under the 2018 Bridge Facility Agreement and the other finance documents relating to the
2018 Bridge Facility Agreement;

   - undertakes with each finance party that whenever another obligor does not pay any amount when due
under or in connection with any finance document relating to the 2018 Bridge Facility Agreement, that
Guarantor shall immediately on demand pay that amount as if it were the principal obligor in respect of
that amount; and

   - indemnifies each finance party immediately on demand against any cost, loss or liability suffered by that
finance party if any amount claimed by a finance party under the guarantee is not recoverable from the
guarantor on the basis of the guarantee. The amount of the cost, loss or liability shall be equal to the
amount which that finance party would otherwise have been entitled to recover.

**_Governing Law_**

The 2018 Bridge Facility Agreement is governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with English
law, although the incurrence covenants contained therein, which largely replicate the relevant covenants from the
2022 Notes, shall be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

**_Agreed Security Principles_**

Substantially the same Agreed Security Principles that apply to the Senior Facilities Agreement apply to the
2018 Bridge Facility Agreement.

**Secured Trading Line and Hedging**

Drax Power has entered into ISDA agreements (the “STL Master Agreements”) with a number of financial
institutions (the “STL Counterparties”), under which Drax Power can trade UK power, dark green spreads and
gas on a senior secured basis without the requirement for Drax Power to post collateral (the “Secured Trading
**Line”). Certain minimum rating requirements are imposed on the STL Counterparties under the ISDA**
agreements, and STL Counterparties that fail to meet such requirements shall post collateral to Drax Power to the
extent of any exposure Drax Power faces on transactions with that STL Counterparty.

The tradable volumes and maximum exposure permitted under the Secured Trading Line are set on a
seasonal basis, based upon parameters set out in the Senior Facilities Agreement. Trading is limited at any time
to five consecutive six-monthly seasons, commencing with Winter 2017/18 and subject to extension by Drax
Power at its discretion at the end of each season, within the parameters of the Senior Facilities Agreement. Under
the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement, the potential future exposure under the Secured Trading Line for
each combination of tradable products must be less than £200 million as determined on a seasonal basis, with the
maximum seasonal trading volume being up to 600MW (or equivalent). The £200 million cap, for each
combination of tradable products, remains in effect to control the voting rights of the STL Counterparties only,
and does not limit their super senior secured claims under the STL, which will be determined in accordance with
the terms of the underlying STL documents and which are uncapped.

Potential future exposure under the Secured Trading Line is calculated on the basis of the net aggregate
mark-to-market exposure of all transactions entered into under the Secured Trading Line and the net aggregate
forecast mark-to-market exposure as if the maximum seasonal trading volume were to be traded for each of the
relevant seasons. However, the actual day-to-day level of exposure will fluctuate and may cross the £200 million
threshold should the forecast exposure fall short of actual levels.

193


-----

The STL Counterparties’ right to terminate all or any part of a transaction entered into with Drax Power
under the relevant STL Master Agreement is prescribed by the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Facilities
Agreement. These extend beyond the usual termination rights under an ISDA agreement, for instance the right to
terminate if Drax Power enters into a transaction under the STL Master Agreement which results in the
maximum seasonal trading volume threshold being exceeded.

The STL Counterparties benefit from the same Collateral as the 2022 Notes, the Initial Notes and the Senior
Facilities Loan, and such Collateral will also secure the New Notes as referred to above and set out under
“Description of Notes— Security”.

In addition, we have outstanding currency rate hedging arrangements and have the ability to enter into
additional currency, interest rate and inflation rate hedging arrangements on a secured basis, with the Hedge
Counterparties also benefiting from the same Collateral as referred to above.

These arrangements are in addition to any commodities and/or currency and interest rate trading that we
undertake on an unsecured and/or title transfer collateral basis.

**Intercreditor Agreement**

**_General_**

In connection with the issuance of the 2022 Notes (the “Senior Secured Notes”) and the entering into the
Senior Facilities Agreement, the Issuer, the Guarantors and certain other subsidiaries of the Issuer entered into an
intercreditor agreement on 5 May 2017 to govern the relationships and relative priorities among: (i) Deutsche
Bank AG, London Branch acting as security agent for the secured parties (the “Security Agent”); (ii) Barclays
Bank PLC acting as agent under the Senior Facilities Agreement (the “Original Credit Facility Agent”); (iii)
the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement (the “Original Lenders”); (iv) the trustee under the 2022
Indenture, on its behalf and on behalf of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes (the “Senior Secured
**Noteholders”) (the “Senior Secured Notes Trustee”); (v) the counterparties to certain hedging arrangements**
(the “Hedging Agreements”), such persons being referred to in such capacity as the “Hedge Counterparties”;
(vi) the counterparties to certain Secured Trading Line arrangements (the “STL Agreements”), such persons
being referred to in such capacity as the “STL Counterparties”; (vii) Intra-Group creditors and debtors;
(viii) Drax Group plc (the “Parent”) and the Group; and (ix) those persons who accede to the Intercreditor
Agreement in accordance with its terms. In connection with the issuance of the Initial Notes, the entering into the
Indenture and the incurrence of Pari Passu Liabilities under such Indenture, the Trustee under the Indenture, on
its behalf and on behalf of the holders of the Initial Notes, acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement on 26 April
2018. In connection with the 2018 Bridge Facility, the entering into the 2018 Bridge Facility Agreement and the
incurrence of Pari Passu Liabilities under such 2018 Bridge Facility Agreement, the Lenders (as defined in the
2018 Bridge Facility Agreement), the Mandated Lead Arrangers (as defined in the 2018 Bridge Facility
Agreement) and the Facility Agent (as defined in the 2018 Bridge Facility Agreement), acceded to the
Intercreditor Agreement as Pari Passu Creditors, Pari Passu Arrangers, and as a Creditor Representive,
respectively, pursuant to that certain Creditor/Creditor Representative Accession Undertaking effective as of
21 December 2018.

The Trustee, on its behalf and on behalf of the holders of the New Notes (the “Noteholders”), acceded to
the Intercreditor Agreement on 26 April 2018 with respect to the Initial Notes.

DGHL and each of its subsidiaries that incurs liabilities above a prescribed limit or provides any guarantee
under the Senior Facilities Agreement or the Indenture are each referred to in this description as a “Debtor” and
are referred to collectively as the “Debtors”.

The Intercreditor Agreement sets out:

   - the relative ranking of certain indebtedness of the Debtors;

   - the relative ranking of certain security granted by the Debtors;

   - when payments can be made in respect of certain indebtedness of the Debtors;

   - when enforcement actions can be taken in respect of that indebtedness;

   - the terms pursuant to which that indebtedness will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain
insolvency events;

   - provisions in respect of control of the enforcement process (if undertaken);

194


-----

   - turnover provisions; and

   - when security and guarantees will be released to permit a sale of any assets subject to transaction security
(the “Collateral”).

For the purposes of this section only:

   - the Senior Facilities Agreement and “Credit Facility” means, on or prior to the later of the date on which
(i) the Senior Facilities Agreement, and (ii) any additional credit facility (an “Additional Credit
**Facility”) not prohibited under the Indenture and entered into with the consent of the Original Lenders, is**
discharged (the “Original Lender Discharge Date”), the Senior Facilities Agreement and any Additional
Credit Facility, and thereafter, any credit facility as permitted under the Pari Passu Debt Documents (as
defined below);

   - the “Group” means Drax Group Holdings Limited (“DGHL”) and its Restricted Subsidiaries; and

   - “Creditor Representative” means:

O in relation to certain of the Original Lenders, the Original Credit Facility Agent;

O in relation to the Credit Facility lenders under any other Credit Facility, the facility agent (or
equivalent) in respect of that Credit Facility;

O in relation to the Senior Secured Noteholders, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee; and

O in relation to any other Pari Passu Creditors (as defined below), the entity that accedes to the
Intercreditor Agreement as the “Creditor Representative” of such Pari Passu Creditors.

The Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions relating to future indebtedness that may be incurred by the
Issuer and the Guarantors that is permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement, the Hedging Agreements, the STL
Agreements, any Finance Document under and as described in the Credit Facility Agreement (the “Credit
**Facility Documents”), the Pari Passu Debt Documents (as defined below), the Security Documents (as defined**
below) and any agreement evidencing the terms of any Parent Liabilities (as defined below) or Intra-Group
Liabilities as well as any document designated as such by the applicable Security Agent and DGHL (together, the
“Debt Documents”) that are not subordinated in right of payment to any Super Senior Liabilities (as defined
below) or the Pari Passu Liabilities (as defined below), to be secured by the Collateral, subject to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement. Such future indebtedness may be incurred pursuant to an indenture or a facility
agreement, and with the Senior Secured Indenture are referred to as “Pari Passu Debt Agreements”. Each
document required to implement the issuance of Senior Secured Notes (the “Senior Secured Note Documents”)
and such future indebtedness (together with the Senior Secured Note Documents, the “Pari Passu Debt
**Documents”) evidence the liabilities owed by the Debtors to the Senior Secured Noteholders (the “Senior**
**Secured Note Liabilities”) and creditors (together with the Senior Secured Noteholders, the “Pari Passu**
**Creditors”) under such future indebtedness (together with the Senior Secured Note Liabilities, the “Pari Passu**
**Liabilities”).**

The Indenture forms part of the Pari Passu Debt Agreements and each document (if any) required to
implement the issuance of the New Notes will form part of the Pari Passu Debt Documents. The Noteholders will
be Pari Passu Creditors and the liabilities owed by the Debtors to the Noteholders will form part of the Pari Passu
Liabilities.

The liabilities owed by the Debtors to creditors under the Super Senior Documents (as defined below) are
referred to as the “Super Senior Liabilities”, and the creditors under those documents are referred to as the
“Super Senior Creditors”.

The Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions empowering the Security Agent to appoint a delegate or
co-security agent to perform its obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement.

Unless expressly stated otherwise in the Intercreditor Agreement, the provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement override anything in the Credit Facility Documents, the Hedging Agreements and STL Agreements
(together, the “Super Senior Documents”) or the Pari Passu Debt Documents. By accepting a New Note,
holders of the New Notes shall be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms and conditions of, the
Intercreditor Agreement and to have authorised the Trustee’s entry into the Intercreditor Agreement on their
behalf.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions, among others, contained in the Intercreditor
Agreement. It does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety, and we urge you to read that document
because it, and not the description that follows, defines your rights as holders of the Notes.

195


-----

**_Ranking and Priority_**

Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the liabilities owed by Debtors to the Super Senior
Creditors and the Pari Passu Creditors (the “Primary Creditors”) shall rank in right and priority of payment pari
_passu and without any preference between them. The liabilities owed by the Debtors to the Parent or intra-Group_
shall be postponed and subordinated to the liabilities owed by the Debtors to the Primary Creditors. The
Intercreditor Agreement does not purport to rank any of the liabilities owed by the Debtors to the Parent or intraGroup as between themselves. Subject to the order of payment set out in “—Application of Proceeds”, nothing in
the Intercreditor Agreement prevents payment by the Parent or any Debtor of fees, costs and expenses payable to
Creditor Representatives (the “Creditor Representative Amounts”).

**_Transaction Security_**

The parties to the Intercreditor Agreement will agree in the Intercreditor Agreement that the security
provided by the Debtors and the Parent for the Super Senior Liabilities and the Pari Passu Liabilities (the
“Transaction Security”) will, subject to the order of payment set out under “—Application of Proceeds”, rank
and secure all such liabilities pari passu and without any preference between them. The Transaction Security is
subject to customary limitations on security as set out under “—Agreed Security Principles”.

**_Application of Proceeds_**

All amounts from time to time received or recovered by the Security Agent pursuant to the terms of any
Debt Document or in connection with the realisation or enforcement of all or any part of the Transaction Security
shall be held by the Security Agent on trust and applied in the following order of priority:

(a) in discharging any sums owed to the Security Agent, any receiver or delegate and in payment of the
Creditor Representative Amounts to the Creditor Representatives;

(b) in discharging all costs and expenses incurred by any Primary Creditor in connection with any
realisation or enforcement of the Transaction Security taken in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement or any action taken at the request of the Security Agent;

(c) in payment or distribution to:

(i) each Creditor Representative in respect of any liabilities owed by any Debtor under the Credit
Facility Documents (the “Credit Facility Liabilities”);

(ii) the Hedge Counterparties in respect of any liabilities owed by any Debtor under the Hedging
Agreements (the “Hedging Liabilities”); and

(iii) the STL Counterparties in respect of any liabilities owed by any Debtor under the STL
Agreements (the “STL Liabilities”),

for application towards the discharge of:

(A) the Credit Facility Liabilities (in accordance with the terms of the Credit Facility
Documents) on a pro rata basis between the Credit Facility Liabilities incurred under
separate Credit Facility Agreements;

(B) the Hedging Liabilities (on a pro rata basis between the Hedging Liabilities of each
Hedge Counterparty); and

(C) the STL Liabilities (on a pro rata basis between the STL Liabilities of each STL
Counterparty),

on a pro rata basis between paragraph (A), paragraph (B) and paragraph (C) above;

(d) in payment or distribution to the Creditor Representatives in respect of any Pari Passu Liabilities on
its own behalf and on behalf of the Pari Passu Creditors for which it is the Creditor Representative
for application towards the discharge of:

(i) the Pari Passu Liabilities (in accordance with the terms of the relevant Pari Passu Debt
Documents) on a pro rata basis between Pari Passu Liabilities under separate Pari Passu
Facility Agreements; and

(ii) the Pari Passu Liabilities (in accordance with the terms of the relevant Pari Passu Debt
Documents) on a pro rata basis between Pari Passu Liabilities under separate Pari Passu Note
Indentures,

on a pro rata basis between paragraph (i) and paragraph (ii) above;

196


-----

(e) if none of the Debtors is under any further actual or contingent liability under any Super Senior
Document or Pari Passu Debt Document, in payment or distribution to any person to whom the
Security Agent is obliged to pay or distribute in priority to any Debtor; and

(f) the balance, if any, in payment or distribution to the relevant Debtor or other person entitled to it
(which other person shall include the trustees of the Drax Pension Scheme where required pursuant
to the Pension Trustee Priority Deed).

**_Permitted Payments_**

_Permitted Payments: Credit Facility Liabilities and Pari Passu Debt Liabilities_

The Intercreditor Agreement permits the Debtors to make payments in respect of the Credit Facility
Liabilities and the Pari Passu Debt Liabilities (which includes the Senior Secured Note Liabilities) at any time in
accordance with the terms of the relevant Debt Documents if at the time of payment no acceleration event has
occurred, at which point payments may only be made from the proceeds of enforcement in the order of payment
set out in “—Application of Proceeds” other than any distribution or dividend out of any Debtor’s unsecured
asset (pro rata to each unsecured creditor’s claim) made by a liquidator, receiver, administrative receiver,
administrator, compulsory manager or other similar officer appointed in respect of any Debtor or any of its
assets.

_Permitted Payments: Hedging Liabilities_

(a) Prior to the Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement (the
“Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date”), the Debtors may not pay, and no Hedge Counterparty
may receive and retain payment of, any amount under a Hedging Agreement unless the payment is
due and payable under that Hedging Agreement and made in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement. On or following an acceleration event, if any amount (following application of payment
netting, close-out netting and cross-affiliate netting) falls due from a Hedge Counterparty to any
Debtor under the Hedging Agreements, that amount shall be paid to the Security Agent and applied
in accordance as set out in “—Application of Proceeds”. Following the occurrence of an acceleration
event, no member of the Group may make payments of the Hedging Liabilities except from
enforcement proceeds distributed as set out in “—Application of Proceeds” other than any
distribution or dividend out of any Debtor’s unsecured asset (pro rata to each unsecured creditor’s
claim) made by a liquidator, receiver, administrative receiver, administrator, compulsory manager or
other similar officer appointed in respect of any Debtor or any of its assets. The Intercreditor
Agreement prevents the Hedge Counterparties and the Debtors, prior to the Credit Facility Lender
Discharge Date, terminating or closing out any part of any hedging transaction prior to its originally
stated maturity date unless it is able to do so under the relevant Hedging Agreement or with the
agreement of the other party thereto and:

(i) (Non-payment) the termination or close-out is by a Hedge Counterparty in circumstances
where any Hedging Liabilities have not been paid to that Hedge Counterparty on the due date
for payment under that Hedging Agreement and the non-payment has not been remedied or
waived (x) within 10 business days after the Hedge Counterparty gave notice of the
non-payment in writing to the Security Agent and the Debtor which failed to make the
payment, and (y) by the time of such termination or close-out;

(ii) (Overhedging) the net aggregate amount of notional amounts of any interest rate Hedging
Transactions is in respect of any secured obligations exceeds 100 per cent. of the principal
amount of all loans, notes, bonds or other similar debt instruments other than drawings by way
of “Letters of Credit” as defined in the Credit Facility Agreement (in each case which carries a
floating rate of interest), outstanding in respect of that Secured Obligation (such excess, the
“Overhedged Amount”), in which case:

(A) the relevant Debtor may terminate all or any part of the relevant Overhedged Amount;
and

(B) a Hedge Counterparty may terminate such proportion of the Overhedged Amount (not
otherwise terminated pursuant to paragraph (A) above within three business days of the
Hedge Counterparty giving notice to the relevant Debtor of its intention to terminate
pursuant to this paragraph (B)) as the net aggregate of notional amounts of its interest

197


-----

rate Hedging Transactions in respect of that Secured Obligation bears to the net
aggregate of the notional amounts of all interest rate Hedging Transactions in respect of
that Secured Obligation;

(iii) (Refinancing) the termination or close-out occurs on or immediately following a refinancing
(or repayment) and cancellation in full of any Credit Facility Liabilities or Pari Passu
Liabilities;

(iv) (Net Receipt by a Debtor) subject to compliance by the Debtors with their obligations (if any)
relating to hedging transactions in the Credit Facility Documents, if the termination or
close-out of such hedging transaction (or such part thereof) is by a Debtor and would result in
a net termination or close-out amount in respect of such termination or close-out being payable
to the relevant Debtor;

(v) (Other termination by a Debtor) subject to compliance by the relevant Debtor with its
obligations (if any) relating to hedging transactions under the Credit Facility Documents, the
termination or close-out is by a Debtor and:

(A) an event of default (however described) has occurred and is continuing in respect of the
Hedge Counterparty (or the Hedge Counterparty’s “Credit Support Provider” (as defined
in the relevant Hedging Agreement), if any) under the relevant Hedging Agreement;

(B) an Additional Termination Event (as defined in the relevant Hedging Agreement) has
occurred and is continuing as a result of the relevant Hedge Counterparty failing to
procure the provision of a guarantee, collateral or other credit support document in
accordance with the terms of the relevant Hedging Agreement; or

(C) is made with the consent of the relevant Hedge Counterparty;

(vi) (Following a Distress Event) if a Distress Event has occurred;

(vii) (Following certain Termination Events) if the payment arises from a termination or close-out
in respect of an Affected Transaction (as defined the relevant Hedging Agreement) as a result
of force majeure with respect to that hedging transaction, such as an Illegality, Tax Event, Tax
Event Upon Merger or Force Majeure Event (each as defined in the relevant Hedging
Agreement);

(viii) (Bankruptcy) if the relevant Debtor’s obligation to make the payment arises as a result of a
close-out or termination instituted by the Hedge Counterparty and an event of default has
occurred and is continuing under the relevant Hedging Agreement as a result of an event or
circumstance described in:

(A) section 5(a)(vii) (Bankruptcy) of the 1992 ISDA Master Agreement (if the relevant
Hedging Agreement is based on a 1992 ISDA Master Agreement);

(B) section 5(a)(vii) (Bankruptcy) of the 2002 ISDA Master Agreement (if the relevant
Hedging Agreement is based on a 2002 ISDA Master Agreement); and

(C) any provision of a Hedging Agreement which is similar in meaning and effect to any
provision listed in paragraphs (A) or (B) above (if the Hedging Agreement is not based
on an ISDA Master Agreement);

(ix) (Instruction from the Security Agent) if the termination or close-out is by a Hedge
Counterparty and the Security Agent has instructed it to terminate or close-out in accordance
with paragraph (b) below; or

(x) if, prior to a Distress Event (as defined below), DGHL has certified to the Hedge Counterparty
that that termination or close-out would not result in a breach of any term of a Credit Facility
Document or a Pari Passu Debt Document.

(b) Prior to the Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date, a Hedge Counterparty must not demand or
receive payment for, and the Debtors will not pay or otherwise discharge, any of the Hedging
Liabilities in cash or in kind except for:

(i) scheduled payments due under and in accordance with the Hedging Agreements paid by the
Debtors in cash;

198


-----

(ii) payments to the extent that the relevant Debtor’s obligation to make the payment arises as a
result of the operation of:

(A) any of sections 2(d) (Deduction or Withholding for Tax), 2(e) (Default Interest; Other
_Amounts), 8(a) (Payment in the Contractual Currency), 8(b) (Judgments) and 11_
(Expenses) of the 1992 ISDA Master Agreement (if the Hedging Agreement is based on
a 1992 ISDA Master Agreement);

(B) any of sections 2(d) (Deduction or Withholding for Tax), 8(a) (Payment in the
_Contractual Currency), 8(b) (Judgments), 9(h)(i) (Prior to Early Termination) and 11_
(Expenses) of the 2002 ISDA Master Agreement (if the Hedging Agreement is based on
a 2002 ISDA Master Agreement); or

(C) any provision of a Hedging Agreement which is similar in meaning and effect to any
provision listed in paragraphs (A) or (B) above (if the Hedging Agreement is not based
on an ISDA Master Agreement);

(iii) payments due out of the proceeds of enforcement of the security in accordance with the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(iv) payments due under the relevant Hedging Agreement in relation to any termination or
close-out permitted as set out above,

and provided that:

(a) subject to sub-paragraph (b) below, in the event of any termination or close-out by a
Hedge Counterparty pursuant to paragraph (a)(i) (Non-payment), above, which results in
a termination or closeout amount payable by the relevant Debtor (after the application of
close-out netting) which exceeds £20 million (or its currency equivalent), without
prejudice to the Hedge Counterparty’s right to demand payment, the Debtors must not
pay or otherwise discharge, and the Hedge Counterparty must not receive payment for,
such termination or close-out amount unless and until 10 business days have elapsed
from the date of such termination or close-out; and

(b) on or following the occurrence of a Distress Event, without prejudice to a Hedge
Counterparty’s right to demand payment, no Hedging Liabilities shall be paid or
otherwise discharged (in the case of an insolvency event, to the extent the Hedging
Liabilities are owed by the insolvent Debtor) except pursuant to the receipt of payments
referred to in sub-paragraph (iii) above and, in the event of any such payment or
discharge other than pursuant to the receipt of payments referred to in sub-paragraph
(iii) above, the turnover arrangements in the Intercreditor Agreement shall apply.

(c) Prior to the Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date, a Hedge Counterparty must not
make any demand against a Debtor in relation to any guarantee, indemnity or other
assurance against loss received by that Hedge Counterparty in respect of the Hedging
Liabilities owing to it (other than any indemnity contained in an ISDA Master
Agreement), before the termination or close-out of all hedging transactions of that
Hedge Counterparty.

(d) Prior to the Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date, no Hedge Counterparty or Debtor
may, subject to paragraph (e) below, allow any Hedging Liabilities or any amounts
owing from a Hedge Counterparty to a Debtor under or in connection with the Hedging
Agreements to which they are a party to be discharged by set-off, any right of
combination of accounts or otherwise.

(e) Paragraph (d) above does not apply to any such discharge:

(i) pursuant to the exercise of any payment netting, close-out netting or cross-affiliate
netting;

(ii) pursuant to the exercise by a Debtor of any right of set-off or netting:

(A) in circumstances where an event of default (however described) has
occurred in respect of that Hedge Counterparty (or that Hedge
Counterparty’s “Credit Support Provider” (as defined in the relevant

199


-----

Hedging Agreement), if any) under the Hedging Agreements to which it is a
party and where no event of default (however described) is outstanding
under the Credit Facility Documents or Pari Passu Debt Documents; and

(B) other than against any Credit Facility Debt or Pari Passu Debt owing to that
Hedge Counterparty,

and, for the purposes of sub-paragraph (A) above, a Hedge Counterparty shall be
entitled to assume that no event of default (however described) is outstanding
under the Credit Facility Documents or Pari Passu Debt Documents unless and
until it has received written notice of an event of default from a Debtor or from
the Security Agent; or

(iii) following an acceleration event, pursuant to the exercise by the Security Agent or
by a Debtor at the request of the Security Agent or by the Hedge Counterparty (in

consented) of any right of set-off or netting of a Debtor or Hedge Counterparty.

“Majority Super Senior Creditors” means, at any time, those Super Senior Creditors whose credit
participations with respect to Super Senior Liabilities at that time aggregate more than 50 per cent. of the total
credit participations with respect to Super Senior Liabilities at that time.

“Majority Pari Passu Creditors” means, at any time, those Pari Passu Creditors whose credit

_Permitted Payments: STL Liabilities_

(a) Prior to the Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date, the Debtors may not pay, and no STL
Counterparty may receive and retain payment of, any amount under a STL Agreement unless the
payment is due and payable under that STL Agreement and made in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement. On or following an acceleration event, if any amount (following
application of payment netting, close-out netting and cross-affiliate netting) falls due from a STL
Counterparty to any Debtor under the STL Agreements, that amount shall be paid to the Security
Agent and applied in accordance the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement as set out in
“—Application of Proceeds”. Following the occurrence of an acceleration event, no member of the
Group may make payments of the STL Liabilities except from enforcement proceeds distributed as
set out in “—Application of Proceeds” other than any distribution or dividend out of any Debtor’s
unsecured asset (pro rata to each unsecured creditor’s claim) made by a liquidator, receiver,
administrative receiver, administrator, compulsory manager or other similar officer appointed in
respect of any Debtor or any of its assets. The Intercreditor Agreement prevents the STL
Counterparties and the Debtors, prior to the Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date, terminating or
closing out any part of any hedging transaction prior to its originally stated maturity date unless it is
able to do so under the relevant STL Agreement or with the agreement of the other party thereto and:

(i) (Non-payment or non-delivery) the termination or close-out is by a STL Counterparty in
circumstances where any STL Liabilities have not been paid or any delivery under a STL
Agreement has not been made to that STL Counterparty on the due date for payment or
delivery under that STL Agreement and the non-payment or non-delivery has not been
remedied or waived (x) within 10 business days after the STL Counterparty gave notice of the
non-payment or non-delivery in writing to the Security Agent and the Debtor which failed to
make the payment, and (y) by the time of such termination or close-out;

(ii) (Net receipt by a Debtor) the termination or close-out is by a Debtor and would result in a net
termination or close-out amount in respect of such termination or close-out being payable to
the relevant Debtor;

(iii) (Other termination by a Debtor) the termination or close-out is by a Debtor and an event of
default (however described) has occurred and is continuing in respect of the STL Counterparty
(or that STL Counterparty’s Credit Support Provider (as defined in the relevant STL
Agreement), if any) under the relevant STL Agreement;

(iv) (Following a Distress Event) the termination or close-out is by a STL Counterparty and a
Distress Event has occurred;

200


-----

(v) (Following certain Termination Events) the termination or close-out is in respect of an
Affected Transaction (as defined in the relevant STL Agreement) as a result of force majeure
with respect to that hedging transaction, such as an Illegality, Tax Event, Tax Event Upon
Merger or Force Majeure Event (each as defined in the relevant STL Agreement);

(vi) (Bankruptcy) the termination or close-out is by a STL Counterparty and an event of default
(however described) has occurred and is continuing under the relevant STL Agreement as a
result of an event or circumstance described in:

(A) section 5(a)(vii) (Bankruptcy) of the 1992 ISDA Master Agreement (if the relevant STL
Agreement is based on a 1992 ISDA Master Agreement);

(B) section 5(a)(vii) (Bankruptcy) of the 2002 ISDA Master Agreement (if the relevant STL
Agreement is based on a 2002 ISDA Master Agreement); and

(C) any provision of a STL Agreement which is similar in meaning and effect to any
provision listed in paragraphs (A) or (B) above (if the STL Agreement is not based on
an ISDA Master Agreement);

(vii) (Other termination by a STL Counterparty) the termination or close-out is by a STL
Counterparty and an Additional Termination Event (as defined in the relevant STL
Agreement) has occurred and is continuing under the relevant STL Agreement as a result of:

(A) (Relevant Intercreditor Agreement undertakings) a failure by a Debtor to comply with
certain of its obligations with respect to Intra-Group liabilities or Parent Liabilities,
provided that such failure is continuing after 30 days have elapsed from the date the
STL Counterparty first notified the Security Agent and the relevant Debtor in writing of
such failure;

(B) (Illegality in respect of the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement) it
being or becoming unlawful for any Debtor or DGHL to perform any of its material
obligations under the security documents or the Intercreditor Agreement, provided that
10 business days have elapsed from the date the STL Counterparty first notified the
Security Agent and the relevant Debtor in writing of such event or circumstance;

(C) (Invalidity) any security document, the Intercreditor Agreement or a STL Agreement to
which that STL Counterparty is a party not being effective in accordance with its terms
or being alleged by a Debtor or DGHL to be ineffective in accordance with its terms for
any reason (in each case other than as a result of any release of Transaction Security
given by the Security Agent in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement), provided
that 10 business days have elapsed from the date the STL Counterparty first notified the
Security Agent and the relevant Debtor in writing of such event or circumstance; or

(D) (Repudiation) any Debtor or DGHL repudiating a security document, the Intercreditor
Agreement or a STL Agreement to which that STL Counterparty is a party or
evidencing an intention to repudiate a security document, the Intercreditor Agreement or
a STL Agreement to which that STL Counterparty is a party, provided that 10 business
days have elapsed from the date the STL Counterparty first notified the Security Agent
and the relevant Debtor in writing of such event or circumstance;

(viii) (Instruction from the Security Agent) the termination or close-out is by a STL Counterparty
and the Security Agent has instructed it to terminate or close-out in accordance the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement;

(ix) if, prior to a Distress Event, DGHL has certified to the STL Counterparty that that termination
or close-out would not result in a breach of any term of a Credit Facility Document or a Pari
Passu Debt Document; or

(x) (Other STL events) the termination or close-out is:

(A) by a Debtor and is made with the consent of the STL Counterparty or in relation to
remedying breach of any volume, capacity or hedging limit breach or any similar event;

(B) by a STL Counterparty and is made in relation to breach of any volume, capacity or
hedging limit breach or any similar event or breach by a Debtor of any representation,
information undertaking or other covenant or undertaking under a STL Agreement; or

201


-----

(C) is expressly contemplated under the Senior Facilities Agreement (or the Next Credit
Facility Agreement),

and, in each case, is permitted under the Senior Facilities Agreement (as in effect on or around
the Issue Date or as may be amended with the consent of the STL Counterparties) or any
equivalent provision in the Next Credit Facility Agreement provided that such equivalent
provision is approved by the STL Counterparties.

For the purposes of this sub-paragraph (x), “Next Credit Facility Agreement” means the first
other Credit Facility Agreement entered into after the Additional Credit Facility Lender/
Original Lender Discharge Date (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) in respect of
which the Credit Facility Liabilities have not been fully and finally discharged to the
satisfaction of the relevant Creditor Representative (acting reasonably) whether or not as the
result of an enforcement, and/or the Credit Facility Lenders are under a further obligation to
provide financial accommodation to any of the Debtors under the relevant Credit Facility
Documents.

(b) Prior to the Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date, a STL Counterparty must not demand or receive
payment for, and the Debtors will not pay or otherwise discharge, any of the STL Liabilities in cash
or in kind except for:

(i) scheduled deliveries due under and in accordance with the STL Agreements, satisfied by the
relevant Debtor by delivery;

(ii) scheduled payments due under and in accordance with the STL Agreements, paid by the
relevant Debtor in cash;

(iii) payments to the extent that the relevant Debtor’s obligation to make the payment arises as a
result of the operation of:

(A) any of sections 2(d) (Deduction or Withholding for Tax), 2(e) (Default Interest; Other
_Amounts), 8(a) (Payment in the Contractual Currency), 8(b) (Judgments) and 11_
(Expenses) of the 1992 ISDA Master Agreement (if the STL Agreement is based on a
1992 ISDA Master Agreement);

(B) any of sections 2(d) (Deduction or Withholding for Tax), 8(a) (Payment in the
_Contractual Currency), 8(b) (Judgments), 9(h)(i) (Prior to Early Termination) and 11_
(Expenses) of the 2002 ISDA Master Agreement (if the STL Agreement is based on a
2002 ISDA Master Agreement); or

(C) any provision of a STL Agreement which is similar in meaning and effect to any
provision listed in paragraphs (A) or (B) above (if the STL Agreement is not based on
an ISDA Master Agreement);

(iv) payments due out of the proceeds of enforcement of the Transaction Security in accordance
with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(v) payments due under the relevant STL Agreements in relation to any termination or close-out
permitted as set out above,

which results in a termination or close-out amount payable by the relevant Debtor (after
the application of close-out netting) which exceeds £20 million (or its currency
equivalent), without prejudice to the STL Counterparty’s right to demand payment, the

receive payment for, such termination or close-out amount unless and until 10 business
days have elapsed from the date of such termination or close-out; and

(B) on or following the occurrence of a STL Trigger Event, without prejudice to a STL
Counterparty’s right to demand payment, no STL Liabilities shall be paid or otherwise
discharged (in the case of an event or circumstance referred to in limb (c) of the
definition of STL Trigger Event, to the extent the STL Liabilities are owed by the

202

insolvent Debtor) except pursuant to the receipt of payments referred to in
sub-paragraph (iv) above and, in the event of any such payment or discharge other than

that STL Counterparty in respect of the STL Liabilities owing to it (other than any indemnity
contained in an ISDA Master Agreement), before the termination or close-out of all Secured Trading
Line transactions of that STL Counterparty.

(d) Prior to the Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date, no STL Counterparty or Debtor may, subject to
paragraph (e) below, allow any STL Liabilities or any amounts owing from a STL Counterparty to a
Debtor under or in connection with the STL Agreements to which they are a party to be discharged
by set-off, any right of combination of accounts or otherwise.

(e) Paragraph (d) shall not apply to any such discharge:

Super Senior Creditors have consented) of any right of set-off or netting of a Debtor or STL
Counterparty.

_Permitted Payments: Intra-Group Liabilities_

The Intercreditor Agreement permits payments of the Intra-Group Liabilities from time to time when due if
at the time of payment no acceleration event has occurred in respect of the Debt Documents. If an acceleration

which the consent of the “Required Pari Passu Creditors” is required (the “Engaged Pari Passu
**Debt Documents”), each Creditor Representative under Engaged Pari Passu Debt Documents acting**

Engaged Pari Passu Debt Document if the Pari Passu Relevant Action is not regulated by that Pari
Passu Debt Document); and

(b) on and following any Enforcement Action being taken, each Creditor Representative acting on
behalf of any Pari Passu Creditors.

“Required Super Senior Creditors” means:

Required Super Senior Creditors and the Required Pari Passu Creditors consent to that payment being made.

**_Restrictions on Enforcement and Permitted Enforcement_**

_Restrictions on Enforcement: Ancillary Lenders and Issuing Banks_

Save as set out below in “—Permitted Enforcement: Ancillary Lenders and Issuing Banks”, so long as any
of the Super Senior Liabilities (other than any liabilities owed to the lenders who make an ancillary facility

**_Enforcement of Transaction Security_**

_Enforcement Instructions_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction
Security or taking any other enforcement action unless instructed otherwise by the Instructing Group.

Subject to “—Enforcement Decisions” below, the Instructing Group may give or refrain from giving
instructions to the Security Agent to take action as to enforcement in accordance with the Enforcement Principles
as they see fit by way of giving instructions to the Security Agent.

“Instructing Group” means:

(a) subject to paragraph (b) below, the Majority Super Senior Creditors and the Majority Pari Passu
Creditors; and

(b) in relation to instructions as to enforcement, the group of Primary Creditors entitled to give
instructions as to Enforcement as set out in “—Enforcement Decisions”.

_Manner of Enforcement_

If the Transaction Security is being enforced or other action as to enforcement is being taken as set out in
“—Enforcement Instructions” above, the Security Agent shall enforce the Transaction Security or take other
action as to enforcement in such manner (including, without limitation, the selection of any administrator (or any
analogous officer in any jurisdiction) of any Debtor to be appointed by the Security Agent) as the Instructing
Group shall instruct, provided that such instructions are consistent with the Enforcement Principles or, in the
absence of any such instructions, as the Security Agent considers in its discretion to be appropriate and consistent
with the Enforcement Principles. For the avoidance of doubt, in the absence of instructions from an Instructing
Group, the applicable Security Agent will not be required to take any action.

_Enforcement Decisions_

(a) If either the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Pari Passu Creditors wish to issue
enforcement instructions as described in “—Enforcement Instructions” above, the Creditor
Representatives (and, if applicable, Hedge Counterparties and/or STL Counterparties) representing
the Primary Creditors comprising the Majority Super Senior Creditors or Majority Pari Passu
Creditors (as the case may be) shall deliver a copy of those proposed enforcement instructions (an
“Initial Enforcement Notice”) to the Security Agent and the Security Agent shall promptly forward
such Initial Enforcement Notice to each Creditor Representative, each Hedge Counterparty and each
STL Counterparty which did not deliver such Initial Enforcement Notice.

206


-----

(b) Subject to paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) below, the Security Agent will act in accordance with
enforcement instructions received from the Majority Pari Passu Creditors.

(c) If:

(i) the Majority Pari Passu Creditors have not either:

(A) made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security
Agent to pursue (and notified the Security Agent of that determination in writing); or

(B) appointed a financial adviser to assist them in making such a determination, within three
months of the date of the Initial Enforcement Notice; or

(ii) the Super Senior Discharge Date has not occurred within six months of the date of the Initial
Enforcement Notice,

then the Security Agent will act in accordance with Enforcement Instructions received from the
Majority Super Senior Creditors until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred.

(d) If an insolvency event (other than an insolvency event directly caused by any enforcement action
taken by or at the request or direction of a Super Senior Creditor or Pari Passu Creditor) is
continuing with respect to a Debtor then the Security Agent will, to the extent the Majority Super
Senior Creditors elect to provide such enforcement instructions, act in accordance with enforcement
instructions received from the Majority Super Senior Creditors until the Super Senior Discharge
Date has occurred.

(e) If the Majority Pari Passu Creditors have not either:

(i) made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent
to pursue (and notified the Security Agent of that determination in writing); or

(ii) appointed a financial adviser to assist them in making such a determination, and the Majority
Super Senior Creditors:

(A) determine in good faith (and notify the other Creditor Representatives, the Hedge
Counterparties, the STL Counterparties and the Security Agent) that a delay in issuing
enforcement instructions could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on the ability to effect a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) or on the expected
realisation proceeds of any enforcement; and

(B) deliver enforcement instructions which they reasonably believe to be consistent with the
Enforcement Principles and necessary or advisable to enhance the prospects of
achieving the Enforcement Objective before the Security Agent has received any
Enforcement Instructions from the Majority Pari Passu Creditors,

then the Security Agent will act in accordance with the enforcement instructions received from the
Majority Super Senior Creditors until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred.

“Super Senior Discharge Date” means the first date on which all Super Senior Liabilities have been fully
and finally discharged to the satisfaction of the relevant Creditor Representative(s) (acting reasonably) (in the
case of the Credit Facility Liabilities), each Hedge Counterparty (acting reasonably) (in the case of its Hedging
Liabilities) and each STL Counterparty (acting reasonably) (in the case of its STL Liabilities), whether or not as
the result of an enforcement, and the Super Senior Creditors are under no further obligation to provide financial
accommodation to any of the Debtors under the Super Senior Documents.

_Enforcement Principles_

The Instructing Group may only give enforcement instructions that are consistent with certain security
enforcement principles (the “Enforcement Principles”), including that:

(a) It shall be the primary and overriding aim of any enforcement to maximise, to the extent consistent
with a prompt and expeditious realisation of value, the value realised from enforcement (the
“Enforcement Objective”).

(b) The Transaction Security will be enforced and other action as to enforcement will be taken such that
either:

(i) to the extent the Instructing Group is the Majority Super Senior Creditors, all proceeds of
enforcement are received by the Security Agent in cash for distribution as set out in
“—Application of Proceeds”; or

207


-----

(ii) to the extent the Instructing Group is the Majority Pari Passu Creditors, either:

(A) all proceeds of enforcement are received by the Security Agent in cash for distribution
as set out in “— Application of Proceeds”; or

(B) sufficient proceeds from enforcement will be received by the Security Agent in cash to
ensure that, when the proceeds are applied as set out in “—Application of Proceeds”, the
Super Senior Discharge Date will occur (unless the Majority Super Senior Creditors
agree otherwise).

(c) On:

(i) a proposed enforcement in relation to assets subject to Transaction Security other than shares
in a member of the Group, where the aggregate book value of such assets exceeds £5 million
(or its equivalent in any other currency or currencies); or

(ii) a proposed enforcement in relation to assets subject to Transaction Security comprising some
or all of the shares in a member of the Group,

which, in either case, is not being effected through a public auction, the Security Agent shall, if
requested by the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Pari Passu Creditors, appoint a
financial adviser to provide an opinion that the proceeds received or recovered in connection with
that enforcement are fair from a financial point of view taking into account all relevant
circumstances (a “Fairness Opinion”) in relation to that enforcement, provided that the Security
Agent shall not be required to appoint a financial adviser nor obtain a Fairness Opinion if a proposed
enforcement:

(A) would result in the receipt of sufficient enforcement proceeds in cash by the Security Agent to
ensure that, after application as set out in “—Application of Proceeds”:

(1) in the case of an enforcement requested by the Majority Super Senior Creditors, the
Final Discharge Date would occur; or

(2) in the case of an enforcement requested by the Majority Pari Passu Creditors, the Super
Senior Discharge Date would occur;

(B) is in accordance with any applicable law; and

(C) complies with the process set out in “—Distressed Disposals” below.

(d) The Security Agent shall be under no obligation to appoint a financial adviser or to seek the advice
of a financial adviser unless expressly required to do so by the Intercreditor Agreement.

(e) The Fairness Opinion will be conclusive evidence that the Enforcement Objective has been met.

**_Option to Purchase and Hedge/STL Transfer: Pari Passu Creditors_**

Some or all of the Pari Passu Creditors (the “Purchasing Secured Creditors”) may, following any of:
(a) an acceleration event in relation to a Credit Facility or Pari Passu Debt; or (b) the enforcement of any
Transaction Security (a “Distress Event”), after having given all Pari Passu Creditors the opportunity to
participate in such purchase, by giving not less than ten days’ notice to the Credit Facility Agent, require the
transfer to them (or to a nominee or nominees) of all (but not part only) of the rights, benefits and obligations in
respect of the Credit Facility Liabilities under the Credit Facility Documents.

If more than one Purchasing Secured Creditor wishes to exercise the option to purchase the Credit Facility
Liabilities, each such Purchasing Secured Creditor shall acquire the Credit Facility Liabilities pro rata, in the
proportion that its credit participation under the Pari Passu Debt Documents bears to the aggregate credit
participations under the Pari Passu Debt Documents of all the Purchasing Secured Creditors.

The Purchasing Secured Creditors may, at the same time as effecting a Credit Facility Liabilities transfer, or
at any time on or after the Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date, by giving not less than ten days’ notice to the
Security Agent, require the transfer of all or, with the agreement of the relevant Hedge Counterparty or STL
Counterparty, as applicable, some, of the Hedging Agreements and STL Agreement and all rights in respect of
the Hedging Liabilities and STL Liabilities.

**_Release of the Security_**

_Non-Distressed Disposals_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, in the case of a Non-Distressed Disposal (as defined below) the
Security Agent is irrevocably authorised (A) to release the Transaction Security or any other claim (relating to a
Debt Document) over that asset; (B) where that asset consists of shares in the capital of a member of the Group
(or a holding company of any member of the Group, which holding company is itself a member of the Group), to
release the Transaction Security (as applicable) or any other claim (relating to a Debt Document) over that
member of the Group’s and its subsidiaries’ property; and (C) to execute and deliver or enter into any release of
Transaction Security (as applicable) or any claim described in sub-paragraphs (A) and (B) above and issue any
certificates of non-crystallisation of any floating charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of
the Security Agent, be considered necessary or desirable.

If a member of the Group is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of each
of the Credit Facility Documents and Pari Passu Debt Documents, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorised
and obliged to release the Transaction Security or any other claim (relating to a Debt Document) over that
member of the Group and its subsidiaries’ assets.

If a guarantor of a Credit Facility is released from its guarantee liabilities in accordance with the terms of
each of the Credit Facility Documents and the Pari Passu Debt Documents and does not have any actual or
prospective borrowing liabilities, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorised and obliged (at the request in
writing by, and at the cost of, the relevant Debtor or DGHL) and without any consent, sanction, authority or
further confirmation from any Creditor or Debtor to release the Transaction Security or any other claim (relating
to a Debt Document) over that guarantor of Credit Facility assets.

In the event of a Non-Distressed Disposal or designation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary, each release of
Transaction Security or any claim described above shall be contingent upon that Non-Distressed Disposal or
resignation being effected, and in the event that such Non-Distressed Disposal is not effected or the conditions
for such release are not fulfilled (as relevant), the Transaction Security shall not be released.

In the event that any security granted pursuant to the Security Documents is permitted to be released
pursuant to the terms of each of the Credit Facility Documents and the Pari Passu Debt Documents, the Security
Agent is irrevocably authorised and obliged (at the request in writing by, and at the cost of, the relevant Debtor or
DGHL and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any Creditor or Debtor) to
release such Transaction Security or any other claim (relating to a Debt Document).

If any disposal proceeds are required to be applied in mandatory prepayment of the Credit Facility
Liabilities or the Pari Passu Liabilities, then those disposal proceeds shall be applied in accordance with the
relevant debt documents and the consent of any other party to the Intercreditor Agreement shall not be required
for that application.

A “Non-Distressed Disposal” is a disposal of an asset of a member of the Group or an asset which is
subject to the Transaction Security to:

(x) a member of the Group which is not a guarantor of the Credit Facility and which will not be required to
become a guarantor of the Credit Facility as a consequence of, or in connection with, the disposal, or (y) a
person or persons outside the Group, in each case, where:

(i)

(1) DGHL confirms in writing to the Security Agent that such disposal, and if the disposal is of
assets subject to the Transaction Security, the release of Transaction Security, is not prohibited
by the terms of any Credit Facility Document or Pari Passu Debt Document (or, if such
disposal and/or release is prohibited by the terms of any such Debt Document, that it has
requested that the relevant Creditor Representative(s) in respect of such Debt Document under
which such disposal and/or release is prohibited notify the Security Agent that such disposal
and/or release is authorised); and

(2) the Creditor Representative in respect of each Credit Facility Document and Pari Passu Debt
Document that prohibits such disposal, and/or release of Transaction Security, notifies the
Security Agent that that disposal and/or release is authorised under its Debt Document; and

(ii) that disposal is not a Distressed Disposal.

209


-----

_Distressed Disposals_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, in circumstances where a disposal of an asset subject to the
Transaction Security which is being: (a) effected at the request of the relevant Instructing Group in circumstances
where the Transaction Security has become enforceable; (b) effected by enforcement of the Transaction Security;
or (c) initiated, after the occurrence of a Distress Event, by a Debtor to a person or persons which is, or are, not a
member of the Group (a “Distressed Disposal”) the Security Agent is irrevocably authorised:

(a) to release the Transaction Security, or any other claim over that asset and execute and deliver or
enter into any release of that Transaction Security, or claim and issue any letters of
non-crystallisation of any floating charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the
Security Agent, be considered necessary or desirable;

(b) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor, to release: (1) that
Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing, guarantee or other
liabilities; (2) any Transaction Security granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor over
any of its assets; and (3) any other claim of a Parent Entity, an Intra-Group Lender, or another
Debtor over that Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf of the
relevant Creditors and Debtors;

(c) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a Debtor,
to release: (1) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any part
of borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities; (2) any Transaction Security granted by any subsidiary
of that holding company over any of its assets; and (3) any other claim of a Parent Entity, an IntraGroup Lender or another Debtor over the assets of any Subsidiary of that holding company, on
behalf of the relevant Creditors and Debtor; and

(d) to dispose of certain intra-group liabilities in order to facilitate a Distressed Disposal comprising a
share sale.

**_Consents, Amendments and Override_**

_Required consents_

Subject to agreed exceptions as to consent requirements of other parties or majority requirements, the
Intercreditor Agreement may be amended or waived with the consent of the Security Agent and all relevant
primary creditors (or, as applicable, their representatives), provided that to the extent an amendment, waiver or
consent could not reasonably be expected to adversely affect the interests of any other class of secured parties,
only written agreement from any affected class shall be required.

_Agreement to override_

Unless expressly stated otherwise in the Intercreditor Agreement, in the case of any conflict between the
Intercreditor Agreement and any other debt document, the Intercreditor Agreement shall prevail.

**_Governing law_**

The Intercreditor Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it are
governed by English law.

**New Proceeds Loan**

The proceeds loan with respect to the New Notes (the “New Proceeds Loan”) will be documented under an
English law governed loan agreement made between the Issuer, as lender, and Drax Corporate Limited, as
borrower (the “New Proceeds Loan Agreement”). Pursuant to the New Proceeds Loan Agreement, the Issuer
will lend to Drax Corporate Limited the proceeds from the issuance of the New Notes.

212


-----

The New Proceeds Loan will be denominated in US dollars and will bear interest at a rate at least equal to
the interest rate of the New Notes.

Interest on the New Proceeds Loan will be payable in cash semi-annually, concurrently or prior to the
relevant interest payment dates for the New Notes. All amounts payable under the New Proceeds Loan will be
payable to such account or accounts with such person or persons as the Issuer may designate from time to time.
The maturity date of the New Proceeds Loan will be the same date as the maturity date of the New Notes. The
New Proceeds Loan will be unsecured obligations of Drax Corporate Limited.

Except as otherwise required by law, all payments under the New Proceeds Loan Agreement will be made
without deductions or withholding for, or on account of, any applicable tax. In the event that Drax Corporate
Limited is required to make any such deduction or withholding, it shall pay such additional amounts to the Issuer
as may be necessary to ensure that the Issuer receives and retains, in the aggregate, a net payment equal to the
payment which it would have received under the New Proceeds Loan Agreement had no such deduction or
withholding been made.

The New Proceeds Loan Agreement will provide that, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, Drax
Corporate Limited shall repay the New Proceeds Loan in such amounts and on such days so as to ensure that the
Issuer can make payments in respect of repayments, redemptions or repurchases of the New Notes. The New
Proceeds Loan Agreement will provide that, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, Drax Corporate Limited
shall pay the Issuer on demand any amounts under New the Proceeds Loan required to allow the Issuer to pay
additional amounts due under the Indenture governing the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Security—New
_Proceeds Loan”._

The New Proceeds Loan will be assigned by way of security to the Security Agent for the benefit of holders
of the New Notes, the 2022 Notes, the Initial Notes, the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the
2018 Bridge Facility Agreement and counterparties to certain hedging agreements (including under the Secured
Trading Line). See “Description of Notes—Security—New Proceeds Loan”.

**Existing Proceeds Loans**

The proceeds loan with respect to the 2022 Notes (the “2022 Notes Proceeds Loan”) is documented under
an English law governed loan agreement made between the Issuer, as lender, and Drax Corporate Limited, as
borrower (the “2022 Notes Proceeds Loan Agreement”). Pursuant to the 2022 Notes Proceeds Loan Agreement,
the Issuer has lent to Drax Corporate Limited the proceeds from the issuance of the 2022 Notes. The proceeds
loan with respect to the Initial Notes (the “Initial Notes Proceeds Loan” and, together with the 2022 Notes
Proceeds Loan, the “Existing Proceeds Loans”) is documented under an English law governed loan agreement
made between the Issuer, as lender, and Drax Corporate Limited, as borrower (the “Initial Notes Proceeds Loan
**Agreement” and, together with the 2022 Notes Proceeds Loan Agreement, the “Existing Proceeds Loan**
**Agreements”). Pursuant to the Initial Notes Proceeds Loan Agreement, the Issuer has lent to Drax Corporate**
Limited the proceeds from the issuance of the Initial Notes.

The 2022 Notes Proceeds Loan is denominated in pounds sterling and bears interest at a rate at least equal to
the interest rate of the 2022 Notes. The Initial Notes Proceeds Loan is denominated in US dollars and bears
interest at a rate at least equal to the interest rate of the Initial Notes.

Interest on each of the Existing Proceeds Loans is payable in cash semi-annually, concurrently or prior to
the relevant interest payment dates for the 2022 Notes or the Initial Notes, as applicable. All amounts payable
under Existing Proceeds Loans are payable to such account or accounts with such person or persons as the Issuer
may designate from time to time. The maturity date of the 2022 Notes Proceeds Loan is the same date as the
maturity date of the 2022 Notes. The maturity date of the Initial Notes Proceeds Loan is the same date as the
maturity date of the Initial Notes. The Existing Proceeds Loans are unsecured obligation of Drax Corporate
Limited.

Except as otherwise required by law, all payments under the Existing Proceeds Loans will be made without
deductions or withholding for, or on account of, any applicable tax. In the event that Drax Corporate Limited is
required to make any such deduction or withholding, it shall pay such additional amounts to the Issuer as may be
necessary to ensure that the Issuer receives and retains, in the aggregate, a net payment equal to the payment
which it would have received under the Existing Proceeds Loans had no such deduction or withholding been
made.

The Existing Proceeds Loans provides that, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, Drax Corporate Limited
shall repay the Existing Proceeds Loans in such amounts and on such days so as to ensure that the Issuer can

213


-----

make payments in respect of repayments, redemptions or repurchases of the 2022 Notes or the Initial Notes, as
applicable. The Existing Proceeds Loan Agreements provide that, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, Drax
Corporate Limited shall pay the Issuer on demand any amounts under the Existing Proceeds Loans required to
allow the Issuer to pay additional amounts due under the indentures governing the 2022 Notes or the Initial
Notes, as applicable.

The Existing Proceeds Loans have been assigned by way of security to the Security Agent for the benefit of
holders of the 2022 Notes, the Initial Notes, the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the 2018
Bridge Facility Agreement and counterparties to certain hedging agreements (including under the Secured
Trading Line) and, from the Issue Date, for the benefit of holders of the New Notes.

**ROC Agreements**

Drax Power has entered into separate receivable purchase agreements with each of HSBC Bank plc, Lloyds
Bank Commercial Finance Limited and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch (the “ROC Agreements”), pursuant
to which Drax Power may, on an uncommitted, non-recourse basis, sell to these counterparties receivables
relating to ROCs issued to Drax Power and sold by it to third parties.

**Haven Power MRTSA**

Haven Power has entered into a master receivables and transfer and servicing agreement (“Haven Power
**MRTSA”), under which Haven Power as seller and servicer, sells trade receivables (on a non-recourse basis) to**
Ester Finance Titrisation as purchaser, with Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank as the arranger and
calculation agent and Eurotitrisation as the programme agent. The Haven Power MRTSA currently expires in
June 2022 with a break right in favour of the purchaser in June 2019.

DGHL guarantees Haven Power’s obligations under the Haven Power MRTSA.

**Pension Trustee Priority Deed**

The trustees of the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme (the “Pension Trustees”) have been granted
second-ranking security over the Collateral (other than the Scottish Collateral) pursuant to second-ranking
security documents (on substantially similar terms as the Existing Security Documents, save for ranking) (the
“Second Ranking Security”).

The ranking of the Second Ranking Security is governed by the terms of an amended and restated second
ranking security priority deed (the “Pension Trustee Priority Deed”) entered into by the Pension Trustees, the
Security Agent and Drax Group plc and certain of its subsidiaries.

**_Ranking_**

The security constituted by the Security Documents, which secures the 2022 Notes, the Initial Notes, the
Senior Facilities, the 2018 Bridge Facility and the secured hedging obligations (including the obligations under
the Secured Trading Line), and on and from the Issue Date shall secure the Notes and the Guarantees, ranks
senior in order of priority to the Second Ranking Security.

**_Undertakings_**

Under the terms of the Pension Trustee Priority Deed, the Group has the flexibility to incur further
indebtedness to the extent permitted by either the fixed charge coverage ratio or the permitted debt baskets in
each case as set out in the Senior Facilities Agreement, or otherwise with the prior written consent of the Pension
Trustees. As such, the Second Ranking Security does not impose any further restrictions on the Group’s ability to
incur further indebtedness than those restrictions contained in the Senior Debt Documents (as defined in the
Pension Trustee Priority Deed).

The Second Ranking Security shall not be amended in a manner which might reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the interests of the Security Agent or the security constituted by the Security Documents, except
with the prior written consent of the Security Agent.

The Pension Trustees must be given at least five business days’ prior written notice of disposals of assets
subject to the Second Ranking Security the proceeds of which would exceed £50,000,000.

Subject to the limitations set out in the Pension Trustee Priority Deed, any additional Senior Security (as
defined in the Pension Trustee Priority Deed) granted in priority to the Second Ranking Security will require
additional second ranking security to be granted in favour of the Pension Trustees.

214


-----

**_Enforcement and Release_**

Prior to the discharge of the Senior Debt (as defined in the Pension Trustee Priority Deed) secured by the
Collateral, the Pension Trustees shall not take any action to enforce the Second Ranking Security without the
prior written consent of the Security Agent.

The Pension Trustee Priority Deed provides for an order of application of the proceeds of enforcement and,
prior to the discharge of the Senior Security, for the Pension Trustees to deliver any proceeds of enforcement
however recovered to the Security Agent for application in that order, ensuring that such proceeds are applied
first toward the discharge of the Senior Debt in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. See
“—Intercreditor Agreement—Application of Proceeds”.

The Second Ranking Security over all the shares in a chargor or of an asset of a chargor is to be released on
disposal of those shares or that asset, and the Pension Trustees grant a further assurance to give effect to this
release.

**_Changes to Senior Debt and Protection of Priority_**

On the incurrence of new Senior Debt or refinancing of Senior Debt, the Pension Trustees can be requested
to re-confirm by deed that the Second Ranking Security is junior in priority to that new Senior Debt, enter into
deeds to give effect to the incurrence of the new Senior Debt, and release and immediately retake the Second
Ranking Security over the same assets as before.

The priority established in the Pension Trustee Priority Deed is continuing and is not affected by
intermediate discharge of any security, and the order of priority set out therein is not affected by the nature of any
security granted, the date of receipt of notice of the same, fluctuations in amounts of liabilities, insolvency
proceedings or the provision of any document related to the security, among other things.

**_Changes to the Parties_**

The Pension Trustees may not assign their rights under the Pension Trustee Priority Deed unless one of
them ceases to be a Pension Trustee, in which case a new Pension Trustee will accede to the Pension Trustee
Priority Deed to replace the discharged trustee, or unless the transfer is to the Pension Protection Fund under the
Pensions Act 2004. Any new holder of security senior to the Second Ranking Security other than the Security
Agent must accede to the Pension Trustee Priority Deed.

**_Scottish Ranking Agreement_**

On or after the Issue Date, we anticipate granting the Pension Trustees second-ranking security over the
Scottish Collateral pursuant to second-ranking security documents (on substantially similar terms as the relevant
Existing Security Documents, save for ranking) (the “Second Ranking Scottish Security”). The ranking of the
Second Ranking Scottish Security is anticipated to be governed by both a ranking agreement to be entered into
between, among others, DGEL and the Security Agent in respect of the existing Second Ranking Scottish
Security governed by the laws of Scotland (the “Scottish Ranking Agreement”) and the Pension Trustee
Priority Deed (as amended and restated from time to time). The Scottish Ranking Agreement is anticipated to be
on substantially similar terms as the Pension Trustee Priority Deed.

**DESCRIPTION OF NOTES**

You will find definitions of certain capitalised terms used in this “Description of Notes” under the heading
“—Certain Definitions”. For the purposes of this “Description of Notes”, references to (i) the Issuer refer to Drax
Finco plc only and not to its Subsidiaries (if any) and (ii) DGHL refer to Drax Group Holdings Limited only and
not to any of its Subsidiaries.

The Issuer will issue $200 million aggregate principal amount of 6 [5]⁄8% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (the
“New Notes”) under an indenture dated as of 26 April 2018 (the “Original Issue Date”), as amended by a
supplemental indenture dated as of February 12, 2019, and as further amended by a supplemental indenture to be
entered into on or prior to the date of issuance of the New Notes offered hereby, and as amended, supplemented
or otherwise modified from time to time (the “Indenture”), among the Issuer, the Guarantors, BNY Mellon
Corporate Trustee Services Limited, as trustee (the “Trustee”), Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as security
agent (the “Security Agent”), The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch, as paying agent and The Bank of
New York Mellon SA/NV, Luxembourg Branch, as transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”) and as registrar (the
“Registrar”), in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities
Act. The Indenture is not qualified under, or subject to, the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

Pursuant to the Indenture, the Issuer issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6 [5]⁄8% Senior
Secured Notes due 2025 (the “Initial Notes”, and together with the New Notes, the “Notes”) on the Original
Issue Date. The New Notes will constitute “Additional Notes” under the Indenture. The Initial Notes, the New
Notes and any further Additional Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as a single class
for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers
to purchase, except as otherwise provided in the Indenture. The New Notes will have the same ISINs and CUSIPs
as the Initial Notes; provided further that the New Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S
under the U.S. Securities Act (as defined below) (the “Regulation S New Notes”) will initially be issued bearing
temporary ISINs and CUSIPs that differ from the ISINs and CUSIPs under which the Initial Notes were issued,
and will initially trade separately from the Initial Notes. The consolidation date for the Regulation S New Notes
will be 40 days after the later of (i) the date of the original issuance of the New Notes offered hereby and (ii) the
date on which the New Notes were first offered to persons other than distributors as defined in Regulation S
under the U.S. Securities Act. On and from the consolidation date, the Regulation S New Notes will be
consolidated, and fully fungible, with the Initial Notes.

The net proceeds of the offering of the New Notes sold on the Issue Date will be used by the Group as set
forth in this Offering Memorandum under the caption “Use of Proceeds”.

Unless the context otherwise requires, in this “Description of the Notes”, references to the “Notes” include
the Initial Notes, the New Notes and any Additional Notes that are issued in the future. The Indenture is
unlimited in aggregate principal amount. We may, subject to applicable law, issue an unlimited principal amount
of additional Notes having identical terms and conditions as the Initial Notes and the New Notes (any such
additional Notes actually issued, the “Additional Notes”). The Issuer will only be permitted to issue Additional
Notes in compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture, including the covenant restricting the
Incurrence of Indebtedness and the covenant restricting the Incurrence of Liens (as described below under
“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”,
respectively).

The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and the Notes and refers
to the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not restate those agreements in their entirety.
The Issuer urges you to read the Indenture, the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents,
because they, and not this description, define your rights as Holders of the Notes. Copies of the Indenture, the
forms of the Notes, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement are available as set forth in this
Offering Memorandum under the caption “Available Information”.

The Indenture is subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements. The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the relative ranking of
Indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the Indebtedness, the procedures for
undertaking enforcement action, the subordination of certain Indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of
security and guarantees and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent. See “Description
_of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” for a description of certain terms of the_
Intercreditor Agreement.

The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders
will have rights under the Indenture.

216


-----

**Brief Description of the Notes and the Note Guarantees**

**_The Notes_**

The Initial Notes are, and the New Notes will be, general senior obligations of the Issuer and are, or will:

   - rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future obligations of the Issuer that are not
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including the obligations of the Issuer under the
2022 Notes, Indebtedness Incurred under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the 2018 Bridge Facility
Agreement and certain Hedging Obligations (including the obligations under the Secured Trading Line);

   - be senior in right of payment to all existing and future obligations of the Issuer that are expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

   - be secured by the Collateral (in the case of the New Notes, on and from the Issue Date), but the Holders
of the Notes will only receive proceeds from the enforcement over the Collateral and certain distressed
disposals after certain obligations of DGHL and its Subsidiaries, including the Indebtedness under the
Senior Facilities Agreement and certain Hedging Obligations (including the obligations under the Secured
Trading Line), have been repaid and discharged in full;

   - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future obligations of the Issuer that are secured by
property or assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of the property and assets
securing such obligations; and

   - be structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations of the non-Guarantor Subsidiaries of
DGHL.

The Initial Notes are, and the New Notes will be, represented by one or more registered Notes in global
registered form, but in certain circumstances may be represented by Definitive Registered Notes. See “Book_Entry; Delivery and Form”._

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of an enforcement of the Collateral, the
Holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral or from certain distressed
disposals of the Collateral only after (i) the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement, (ii) counterparties to
certain Hedging Obligations (including the obligations under the Secured Trading Line), (iii) lenders or creditors
under certain other Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred on a super priority basis under the Indenture (including
any Indebtedness that refinances the Senior Facilities Agreement) and (iv) certain amounts owing to the Security
Agent, any receiver and certain creditor representatives (including the Trustee) have been repaid in full. Any
remaining amounts from the proceeds of the enforcement of the Collateral will then be applied, pari passu and
pro rata, to amounts due under the 2022 Notes, the Notes and any pari passu additional indebtedness incurred in
the future. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”.

_The Note Guarantees_

The Initial Notes are, and, on the Issue Date, the New Notes will be, guaranteed by the Guarantors. In
addition, if required by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees”, certain
other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Note Guarantee in the future.

The Note Guarantee of each Guarantor is, or will be, a general, joint and several, senior obligation of that
Guarantor and:

   - ranks, or will rank, pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future obligations of that
Guarantor that are not expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee, including the
guarantees in respect of the 2022 Notes, Indebtedness Incurred under the Senior Facilities Agreement and
the 2018 Bridge Facility Agreement and certain Hedging Obligations (including the obligations under the
Secured Trading Line);

   - rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future obligations of such Guarantor that are expressly
subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee;

   - (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) is, or will be, secured by the Collateral as set forth under
“—Security”, but the Holders of the Notes will only receive proceeds from the enforcement over the
Collateral and certain distressed disposals after certain obligations of DGHL and its Subsidiaries,
including the Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities Agreement and certain Hedging Obligations
(including the obligations under the Secured Trading Line), have been repaid and discharged in full;

217


-----

   - is, or will be, structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations of any Subsidiaries of DGHL
that are not Guarantors or the Issuer; and

   - is, or will be, effectively subordinated to all existing and future obligations of such Guarantor that are
secured by property or assets that do not secure such Note Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the
property and assets securing such obligations.

The obligations of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee and the Security Interests it has granted to
secure its Note Guarantee, if any, is, or will be, contractually limited to reflect limitations under applicable law
with respect to maintenance of share capital, corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance and
other legal restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and their respective shareholders, directors and general
partners. For a description of such contractual limitations, see “Certain Insolvency Considerations and
_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and Security”. By virtue of these limitations, a_
Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee and its Security Interests, if any, could be significantly less than
amounts payable with respect to the Notes. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees
_and Our Capital Structure—Each Guarantee and security interest is subject to certain limitations on_
_enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defences that may limit its validity and_
_enforceability”._

**_General_**

The Issuer is a special purpose vehicle and has no material liabilities or assets other than its liabilities under
the 2022 Notes, the 2022 Indenture, the Initial Notes, the Indenture, its guarantee under the Senior Facilities
Agreement and the 2018 Bridge Facility Agreement and certain hedging obligations (including the obligations
under the Secured Trading Line), its claims under the 2022 Notes Proceeds Loan Agreement pursuant to which
the proceeds from the issue of the 2022 Notes have been on lent to Drax Corporate Limited, its liabilities under
the Initial Notes and the Indenture and its claims under the Initial Notes Proceeds Loan Agreement pursuant to
which the proceeds from the issue of the Initial Notes have been on lent to Drax Corporate Limited and,
following the Issue Date, its liabilities under the New Notes and the Indenture and its claims under the New
Proceeds Loan Agreement pursuant to which the proceeds from the issue of the New Notes will be on lent to
Drax Corporate Limited. Accordingly, the Issuer is dependent on payments under the 2022 Notes Proceeds Loan,
the Initial Notes Proceeds Loan and the New Proceeds Loan to meet its obligations, including under the
Indenture and the Notes. All of the operations of Drax Corporate Limited are conducted through its Subsidiaries
and, therefore, Drax Corporate Limited in turn depends on the cash flow of its Subsidiaries to meet its
obligations, including its obligations under its Note Guarantee, New Proceeds Loan Agreement, the Initial
Proceeds Loan Agreement and the 2022 Notes Proceeds Loan Agreement.

Certain Restricted Subsidiaries, which include Drax Biomass Holdings Limited, Drax Holdings Limited,
Drax Pension Trustees Limited, Drax Group Project Services Limited, Drax CCS Limited, Drax Generation
(Selby) Limited, Abergelli Power Limited, Hirwaun Power Limited, Millbrook Power Limited, Pike Bioenergy
LLC, Progress Power Limited, Opus Energy Marketing Limited, Opus Gas Limited, Select Energy Limited,
Domus Energy Limited, Opus Water Limited and SMW Limited will not guarantee the New Notes. Any right of
the Issuer or any Guarantor to receive assets of any of the non-Guarantor Subsidiaries upon that non-Guarantor
Subsidiary’s bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganisation (and the consequent right of the Holders of Notes to
participate in those assets) will be structurally subordinated to that non-Guarantor Subsidiary’s Indebtedness and
other obligations (including trade payables, preference shares and lease obligations, if any), except to the extent
that the Issuer or such Guarantor is itself recognised as a creditor of the non-Guarantor Subsidiary, in which case
the claims of the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be, would still be effectively subordinated to any
obligations secured over the assets of the non-Guarantor Subsidiary and subordinated in right of payment to any
Indebtedness of the non-Guarantor Subsidiary that is senior to the claims held by the Issuer or such Guarantor.
See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and Our Capital Structure—The Notes and each
_of the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to present and future liabilities of DGHL’s non-Guarantor_
_subsidiaries”._

For the year ended 31 December 2018, the Guarantors (other than DGEL) generated £257.1 million,
representing 103 per cent. of the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA. As of 31 December 2018, the total assets of the
Guarantors (including DGEL) were £4,262.7 million (excluding goodwill), representing 99 per cent. of the
Group’s total assets (excluding goodwill). As of 31 December 2018, after giving pro forma effect to the DGEL
Acquisition and the Transactions as if they had occurred on that date, DGHL and its Restricted Subsidiaries
would have had £1,175.7 million of borrowings outstanding, of which £156.9 million (assuming an issuance at
par) is represented by the New Notes (being the pound sterling equivalent of $200 million, converted at a rate of

218


-----

$1.2751 to £1.00, which was the market rate on 31 December 2018, sourced from Reuters, used for the
preparation of its balance sheet contained in the 2018 Drax Group Audited Financial Statements), £350 million is
represented by the 2022 Notes, £235.3 million is represented by the Initial Notes, £37.1 million is represented by
the Senior Facilities Agreement and £395.9 million is represented by the 2018 Bridge Facility Agreement. As of
31 December 2018, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on that date, the
Restricted Subsidiaries of DGHL that will not guarantee the New Notes would have had no outstanding thirdparty Indebtedness. The Guarantees of the Guarantors may be released as set forth under “Note Guarantees—
_Releases of the Note Guarantees”._

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

As of the Issue Date, all of DGHL’s Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for purposes of the
Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under the definition of “Unrestricted
_Subsidiaries,” the Issuer will be permitted to designate certain of its Subsidiaries as additional “Unrestricted_
_Subsidiaries.” Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer are not subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the_
Indenture. Further, Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer will not guarantee the New Notes.

**Principal and Maturity**

The Issuer will issue $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of New Notes on the Issue Date. The
New Notes will mature on 1 November 2025. The New Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of
$200,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.

**Interest**

Interest on the New Notes will accrue at a rate of 6.625% per annum and will:

   - accrue from (and including) 1 May 2019;

   - be payable in cash semi-annually in arrear on 1 May and 1 November of each year, commencing on
1 November, 2019;

   - be payable to the Holder of record of such New Notes on 15 April or 15 October of each year,
immediately preceding the related interest payment date; and

   - be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on the New Notes are subject to the applicable
procedures of the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”).

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes**

Principal, interest and premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Global Notes will be payable by one
or more Paying Agents by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by the registered
Holder thereof (being DTC or its nominee).

Principal, interest and premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities (“Definitive
**Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents maintained**
for such purposes. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid, at the option of the
Issuer, by cheque mailed to the address of the Holder entitled thereto as shown on the register of Holders of
Notes for the Definitive Registered Notes. See “—Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes”.

The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on such Notes are subject to applicable procedures
of DTC. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Note is not a Business Day at the place at which such
payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next
succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a
result of any such delay.

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Issuer maintains a Paying Agent for the Notes in the City of London. The initial Paying Agent is The
Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch.

The Issuer also maintains a Registrar (a “Registrar”) in Luxembourg and a Transfer Agent in Luxembourg.
The initial Registrar is The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV, Luxembourg Branch, and the initial Transfer

219


-----

Agent is The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV, Luxembourg Branch. The Registrar, the Paying Agent and
Transfer Agent, as applicable, maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes outstanding from time to
time, if any, and make payments on and facilitate transfers of the Notes on behalf of the Issuer.

The Issuer may change the Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent for the Notes without prior notice to
the Holders of Notes. However, for so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the
rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notice of any change of Paying
Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent in a daily newspaper with general circulation in Luxembourg (which is
expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such
notice on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu). The Issuer, DGHL or any of
its other Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the Notes.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Initial Notes have been, and the New Notes will be, issued in global registered form without interest
coupons, as follows:

   - The Initial Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A
under the U.S. Securities Act are currently, and the New Notes sold to qualified institutional buyers
within the United States pursuant to Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act will initially be, represented
by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (“Initial 144A Global
**Notes” and the “New 144A Global Notes”, respectively, and together, the “144A Global Notes”). The**
Initial 144A Global Notes were, on the Original Issue Date, and the New 144A Global Notes will be, on
the Issue Date, deposited with The Bank of New York Mellon as custodian for DTC and registered in the
name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC.

   - The Initial Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act
are, and the New Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the U.S. Securities
Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons
attached (the “Initial Regulation S Global Notes”, and, the “New Regulation S Global Notes”,
respectively and together, the “Regulation S Global Notes”) and, in the case of the New Notes, with
temporary ISIN and CUSIP numbers which are different from the ISIN and CUSIP numbers for the Initial
Notes issued on the Original Issue Date. The Initial Regulation S Global Notes were, on the Original
Issue Date, and the New Regulation S Global Notes will be, deposited with a custodian for DTC and
registered in the name of the nominee of DTC.

The 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Global Notes are collectively referred to as the “Global
**Notes”. Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to Persons that**
have accounts with DTC or Persons that may hold interests through such participants. Beneficial interests in the
Regulation S Global Notes will initially be credited within DTC to Euroclear and Clearstream, on behalf of the
owners of such interests.

Investors may hold their interests in the Regulation S Global Notes directly through Euroclear or
Clearstream, if they are participants in those systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants in
those systems. Investors may also hold their interests in the Regulation S Global Notes through organizations
other than Euroclear or Clearstream that are DTC participants. Each of Euroclear and Clearstream will appoint a
DTC participant to act as its depositary for the interests in the Regulation S Global Notes that are held within
DTC for the account of each settlement system on behalf of its participants.

The New Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act (as
defined below) (the “Regulation S New Notes”) will initially be issued bearing a temporary ISIN and CUSIP
that differ from the ISIN and CUSIP under which the Initial Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to
Regulation S (the “Regulation S Initial Notes”) were issued, and will initially trade separately from the
Regulation S Initial Notes. The consolidation date for the Regulation S New Notes will be 40 days after the later
of (i) the date of the original issuance of the New Notes offered hereby and (ii) the date on which the New Notes
were first offered to persons other than distributors as defined in Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act. On
and from the consolidation date, the Regulation S New Notes will be consolidated, and fully fungible, with the
Initial Notes.

Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on
transfer and certification requirements summarised below and described more fully under “Notice to Investors”.
Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in

220


-----

immediately available funds. In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or
participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and
subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective
participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) may be transferred to a
person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation
**S Book-Entry Interests”) only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in**
the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the U.S.
Securities Act. Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes
delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Note only upon delivery by the transferor of a
written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a
person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule
144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer
restrictions described under “Notice to Investors” and such transfer is in compliance with applicable securities
laws of any jurisdiction.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a
Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it
will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If any Definitive Registered Notes are issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Notes,
they will be issued only in minimum denominations of $200,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of
$1,000 in excess thereof, in each case upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any
certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will
be based upon directions received by DTC from the participant which owns the Book-Entry Interests. Definitive
Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as
otherwise determined by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with
respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarised below and described more fully under “Notice to Investors”.

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, New Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes
may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of $200,000 in principal
amount and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the
Indenture requires the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate
endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at DTC,
where appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such
transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any
Taxes payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent are not required to register the transfer
or exchange of any Definitive Registered Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days prior to the date fixed for selection of the Notes to be redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date with respect
to such Notes; or

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of
Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Security Agent and the Registrar will be
entitled to treat the registered Holders of the Notes as the owners thereof for all purposes.

The Note Guarantee of any Subsidiary Guarantor will be released automatically:

   - upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital Stock of the
relevant Subsidiary Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company) or the sale or other
disposition (including by way of a consolidation or merger) of all or substantially all the assets of the
Subsidiary Guarantor, if the sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described below under

222


-----

“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” and the Subsidiary Guarantor
ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary of DGHL as a result of the sale or other disposition;

   - upon written notice from DGHL to the Trustee, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing; provided that prior to or substantially concurrently with such release, such Subsidiary
Guarantor is unconditionally released and discharged from its liabilities, if any, with respect to the Senior
Facilities Agreement and the 2022 Notes; provided further that, after giving effect to such release, the
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation calculated on the same basis as Consolidated
EBITDA (as defined in the 2022 Indenture) attributable to the Guarantors (determined separately for each
Guarantor and excluding all intra-group items and investments in Subsidiaries of DGHL and its
Restricted Subsidiaries) is at least 80 per cent. of the Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the 2022
Indenture) of DGHL and its Restricted Subsidiaries and the aggregate gross assets of the Guarantors
(calculated on an unconsolidated basis and excluding all intra-group items, goodwill and investments in
Subsidiaries of DGHL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) is at least 80 per cent. of the Total Assets (as
defined in the 2022 Indenture) (excluding goodwill) of DGHL and its Restricted Subsidiaries, in each
case, calculated in accordance with, and in the manner provided by and subject to the same exceptions as
those set forth in, Section 4.15 of the 2022 Indenture as in effect on the Original Issue Date;

   - upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted

upon an enforcement action;

   - as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

   - as described in the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees”;

   - upon written notice from DGHL to the Trustee, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is

Subsidiaries are in compliance with the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—
_Additional Guarantees”;_

   - in connection with a Permitted Reorganisation; or

   - as a result of any transaction permitted by “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”. The Note
Guarantee of DGHL will be released automatically:

   - upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes, legal defeasance,
covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture, as provided in “—Defeasance” and
“—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

   - in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, including
upon an enforcement action;

   - as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

The Trustee and the Security Agent shall take all necessary actions, if any, including the granting of releases
or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, reasonably requested
by DGHL to effectuate any release of a Note Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to
customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee
without the consent of the Holders or any other action or consent on the part of the Trustee (and each holder of
the Notes will be deemed to have irrevocably authorised the Trustee and the Security Agent to execute and
deliver (and, at the request and cost of DGHL, each of the Trustee and the Security Agent will execute and
deliver) any document to the extent necessary or reasonably requested by DGHL to evidence such release and
termination).

223


-----

**Security**

_General_

The Initial Notes are, and on the Issue Date, the New Notes and the Note Guarantees will be, secured by
first-ranking security interests over the following:

   - all of the issued share capital of DGHL and certain receivables owed to DG plc by DGHL;

   - substantially all of the assets of the Issuer, including the receivables owed to the Issuer in respect of the
Initial Notes Proceeds Loan pursuant to which the proceeds of the Initial Notes were on-lent and, on the
Issue Date, the recievables owed to the Issuer in respect of the New Proceeds Loan to which the proceeds
of the New Notes will be on-lent;

   - all of the issued share capital of the Issuer and each Subsidiary Guarantor;

   - substantially all of the assets of each Guarantor incorporated or organised under the laws of England and
Wales;

   - substantially all of the assets of the Scottish Guarantor incorporated or organised under the laws of
Scotland; and

   - substantially all of the assets of each Guarantor organised in or under the laws of the United States (or any
state or territory thereof or the District of Columbia) other than any real property located in the United
States.

The Collateral is or will be pledged pursuant to the Security Documents to the Security Agent on behalf of
the Holders of the New Notes and holders of certain other secured obligations that are secured by the Collateral
(including obligations under the Initial Notes, 2022 Notes, the Senior Facilities Agreement, the 2018 Bridge
Facility Agreement and certain Hedging Obligations (including the obligations under the Secured Trading Line)).
Any additional security interests that may in the future be pledged to secure obligations under the Notes and the
Note Guarantees would also constitute Collateral. The Collateral (other than the Scottish Collateral) is also
pledged on a junior basis to the Notes to the pension trustees under the Drax Power Group section of the
Electricity Supply Pension Scheme. We anticipate granting the pension trustees second-ranking security over the
Scottish Collateral on or after the Issue Date. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements— Pension
_Trustee Priority Deed”._

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain
_Covenants—No Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”, DGHL and_
its Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with certain future
issuances of Indebtedness of DGHL, the Issuer or Restricted Subsidiaries, including any Additional Notes in each
case, as permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognise certain limitations arising under or
imposed by local law and defences generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to
fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital
maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defences affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other
considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations, see “Certain Insolvency
_Considerations and Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and Security”._

In connection with the issuance of the New Notes, existing Security Documents will be amended, confirmed
or acknowledged and extended in or under the laws of Scotland, to also secure the New Notes.

The proceeds from the sale of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the
Holders of Notes and the creditors of other obligations secured thereby. No appraisals of any Collateral have
been prepared by or on behalf of the Issuer, the Security Agent or the Trustee in connection with the offering of
the New Notes. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable
market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and Our Capital Structure—The Collateral may not be_
_sufficient to secure the obligations under the Notes”._

**_Agreed Security Principles_**

In determining the giving of a Note Guarantee and what Liens will be provided in support of the Notes and
the Note Guarantees and the extent of its perfection, the Agreed Security Principles will apply. The Agreed

224


-----

Security Principles embody a recognition that there may be certain practical and legal difficulties in obtaining
effective Guarantees and Security from members of the DGHL Group in every jurisdiction in which DGHL and
its Restricted Subsidiaries are located. Subject as referred to in the third paragraph below, Note Guarantees will
not be given and Security Interests shall not be created or perfected to the extent that:

(1) it would result in a breach of general statutory limitations, financial assistance, corporate benefit,
fraudulent preference, “thin capitalisation”, “earnings stripping”, “controlled foreign corporation”,
transfer pricing, capital maintenance, retention of title claims and similar principles, laws or
regulations, provided that DGHL will use reasonable endeavours to (a) assist in demonstrating that
adequate corporate benefit accrues to each relevant Guarantor and (b) complete any whitewash or
similar procedure required under any relevant financial assistance laws;

(2) the provision and/or perfection of such Note Guarantees or Security Interests would result in costs
(including interest deductability, stamp duty, notarisation or registration fees) to the DGHL Group or
a significant tax disadvantage that, in either case, would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing
to the Holders of the Notes;

(3) such assets are subject to third party arrangements which are permitted by the Indenture and which
prevent those assets from being charged (or assets which, if charged, would give a third party the
right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations of the DGHL Group in
respect of those assets or require any member of the DGHL Group to take any action materially
adverse to the interests of the DGHL Group or any member thereof). Such assets will be excluded
from any relevant Security Document (other than from any floating charge granted pursuant to a
Security Document governed by English law, provided that reasonable endeavours to obtain consent
to charging any such assets shall be used by the relevant Guarantor if the facility agent under the
Senior Facilities Agreement determines the relevant asset to be material and (taking into account
DGHL’s view on any likely impact on commercial relationships with third parties) reasonably
requests, consistent with current and customary market practice in the relevant jurisdiction, DGHL to
do so, and provided further, that such requirement to use reasonable endeavours shall not apply:

(a) in respect of any asset owned or acquired by the Issuer or any Guarantor that is subject to a
Security Interest securing a purchase money, Project Finance Indebtedness, capital or finance
lease obligation or Acquired Indebtedness permitted to be incurred pursuant to the Indenture
(or a refinancing of any of the foregoing) if the contract or other agreement in which such
Security Interest is granted (or the documentation providing for such purchase money, project
financing, capital or finance lease obligation or Acquired Indebtedness or such refinancing)
prohibits or restricts the creation of any other Security Interest on such assets (including if the
grant of any other Security Interest would constitute a breach or default under, result in the
termination of, or give rise to a right on the part of any party thereto to terminate or materially
modify, such contract or agreement or such documentation); or

(b) in the case of any capital stock of any Person that is not a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary, if such
Security Interest is prohibited or restricted (including if the grant of a Security Interest would
constitute a breach or default under, result in the termination of, or give rise to a right on the
part of any party thereto to terminate or materially modify, any such document, contract or
other agreement) by any organisational or governance documents of such Person, any
applicable shareholder or similar agreement or any contract or other agreement governing
Indebtedness of such Person; or

(4) it is not within the legal capacity of the relevant member of the DGHL Group to give the Note
Guarantee or enter into the Security Document or it would conflict with the fiduciary duties of the
Issuer’s or Guarantor’s directors or officers and/or contravene any legal or regulatory prohibition or
could reasonably be expected to result in personal or criminal liability on the part of any director or
officer provided that the relevant Issuer or Guarantor shall use reasonable endeavours to overcome
any such obstacle.

No Note Guarantee, indemnity or Security Interest will be required to be provided by (i) any Unrestricted
Subsidiary, (ii) any Receivables Subsidiary, or (iii) any Project Finance Subsidiary.

Where appropriate to overcome any of the matters referred to the first paragraph above, the obligations
arising under Note Guarantees and the obligations secured under a Security Interest will be limited:

(1) to avoid any breach of corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, “thin
capitalisation”, “earnings stripping”, “controlled foreign corporation”, transfer pricing, capital

225


-----

maintenance, retention of title claims and similar principles, rules or the laws or regulations (or
analogous restrictions) of any applicable jurisdiction; and

(2) to avoid any risk to officers of the relevant member of the DGHL Group that is granting a Lien of
contravention of their fiduciary duties and/or civil or criminal or personal liability.

The following factors will apply when determining the extent of the Note Guarantees and the Liens to be
provided:

(1) the maximum amount guaranteed or secured may be limited to minimise stamp duty, notarisation,
registration or other applicable fees, taxes and duties where the benefit to the Holders of the Notes of
increasing the guaranteed or secured amount is disproportionate to the level of such fee, taxes and
duties;

(2) each Note Guarantee will be an upstream, cross-stream and downstream guarantee and each Note
Guarantee and Lien will be for all liabilities of the Issuer and Guarantors under the Notes and the
Indenture in accordance with, and subject to, the requirements of each relevant jurisdiction;

(3) where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of granting
Liens over the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such Lien, Liens will be granted
over the material assets only;

(4) Liens will be taken in respect of all insurance policies of the Issuer and the Guarantors (other than
third party insurance, public liability insurance, director’s and officer’s insurance and insurance of
Guarantors incorporated or organised under the laws of Delaware or any other U.S. state or
territory), provided that such insurance policy does not prohibit such Lien to be so granted and
_provided further that no perfection of Liens or notification to any third party shall be required in_
respect of insurance policies until the Notes have been accelerated as set out under “—Events of
_Default”;_

(5) where Liens are granted over an insurance policy, no loss payee or other endorsement shall be made
on the insurance policy;

(6) Liens will be granted over all intellectual property of the Issuer and the Guarantors, provided that no
Lien shall be granted over any intellectual property which cannot be secured under the terms of the
relevant licensing agreement and provided further that no perfection or registration of Liens or
notification to any third party shall be required in respect of intellectual property until the Notes have
been accelerated as set out under “—Events of Default”;

(7) where the Issuer or a Guarantor grants Liens over its intellectual property it shall be free to deal with
those assets in the course of its business (including, without limitation, allowing its intellectual
property to lapse if no longer material to its business);

(8) Liens will be granted over all real estate owned by the Issuer or a Guarantor, provided that perfection
or registration of any Lien over real estate prior to the Lien becoming enforceable will only be
required in respect of real estate which is material to the DGHL Group (taken as a whole) and no
perfection or registration will be required in respect of leasehold property. Other than where real
property of the Issuer or a Guarantor is secured by a floating charge or other similar all-asset
security, Liens need only be granted over after-acquired real property where the value of such
property is in excess of £2.5 million (unless the aggregate value of after-acquired property not
secured would exceed £5.0 million). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Liens will be granted over
real estate in the United States;

(9) where the Issuer or a Guarantor grants Liens over real estate, there will be no obligation to
investigate title, provide surveys or other insurance or environmental due diligence;

(10) Liens will be taken in respect of contracts of the Issuer or a Guarantor, provided that no Lien will be
granted over any contract which cannot be secured under the terms of the relevant contract and
_provided further that no perfection of Liens or assignment by way of security or notification to any_
third party shall be required in respect of contracts until the Notes have been accelerated as set out
under “—Events of Default”;

(11) Liens shall be granted over all intercompany and trade receivables, provided that no Lien will be
granted over any such receivables which cannot be secured under the terms of the relevant contract
and provided further that no Lien will be required to be granted or perfected with respect to

226


-----

Receivables Assets that are subject to a Permitted Lien, and provided further that no perfection of
Liens or assignment by way of security or notification to any third party in respect of such
receivables shall be required until the Notes have been accelerated as set out under “—Events of
_Default”;_

(12) where the Issuer or a Guarantor grants a Lien over its receivables it shall be free to deal with those
receivables in the course of its business until the Notes have been accelerated as set out under
“—Events of Default”;

(13) Liens will be taken in respect of shares of the Issuer and the Guarantors, but, other than where shares
owned by the Issuer or a Guarantor in a subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor are secured
by a floating charge or other similar all-asset security, Liens will not be granted over such shares in
subsidiaries of the Issuer or a Guarantor that are not the Issuer or a Guarantor;

(14) where the Issuer or a Guarantor grants Liens over shares, it will be permitted to retain and to exercise
voting rights appertaining to any shares charged by it until the Notes have been accelerated as set out
under “—Events of Default”, provided that such voting rights are not exercised in a manner which
materially adversely affects the validity or enforceability of the Lien;

(15) Liens will be granted over all bank accounts of the Issuer and the Guarantors other than those which
are specifically identified and not required to be secured under the terms of the Senior Facilities
Agreement, provided that no perfection of Liens or notification to any third party shall be required in
respect of bank accounts until the Notes have been accelerated as set out under “—Events of Default”
and provided further that no Lien will be required to be granted or perfected over any (A) bank or
securities accounts, and assets credited thereto, used solely to hold funds in trust for any director,
officer or employee of DGHL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or any employee benefit plan
maintained by DGHL or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries, (B) bank or securities accounts, and
assets credited thereto, the funds and assets in which consist solely of cash earnest money deposits,
deposits to defease or to satisfy and discharge any Indebtedness or deposits under escrow or similar
arrangements in connection with any letter of intent or agreement for any acquisition or investment
permitted under this Agreement or that represent Escrowed Proceeds and (C) bank accounts used
solely for collections of receivables under Qualified Receivables Financings;

(16) subject to paragraph (20) below, where the Issuer or a Guarantor pledges shares or bank accounts,
the Security Document will (subject to any other provision of these Agreed Security Principles) be
governed by the law of the country of incorporation of the Issuer or Guarantor whose shares are
being pledged or the law of the country in which the bank account is located;

(17) subject to paragraph (8) above, where the Issuer or a Guarantor acquires assets of material value and/
or significance after the date on which it initially grants security, the Issuer or such Guarantor shall
enter into Liens in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles in respect of such assets if they
are of a type which, if owned at the Original Issue Date, Liens would have been created in
accordance with the Agreed Security Principles and to the extent that such assets are not subject to
the existing Liens created by the Issuer or such Guarantor;

(18) no perfection action will be required in jurisdictions where the Issuer or the Guarantors are not
incorporated, but perfection action may be required in the jurisdiction of the Issuer or one Guarantor
in relation to Liens granted by the Issuer or another Guarantor, respectively, incorporated in a
different jurisdiction;

(19) no Note Guarantee or Lien will be granted to the extent to which the grant or terms of such Note
Guarantee and Lien, and (prior to the Lien becoming enforceable) the extent of the perfection
requirements in respect of such Lien, would materially and adversely impact the ability of DGHL,
the Issuer or the affected Guarantor to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course of
business or as otherwise permitted under the Note Documents (including, without limitation,
notification of security to third parties) until the Notes have been accelerated as set out under
“—Events of Default”; and

(20) unless granted under a global security document governed by the law of the jurisdiction of DGHL,
the Issuer or a Guarantor or under English law, all security (other than security over shares in the
Issuer or Guarantors) shall be governed by the law of and secure assets located in the jurisdiction of
incorporation of DGHL, the Issuer or that Guarantor.

227


-----

The following principles will be reflected in any Lien taken in respect of the Notes and the Note Guarantees:

(1) perfection of Liens, when required, and other legal formalities will be completed as soon as
practicable and, in any event, within the time periods specified in the relevant Security Document or
(if earlier or to the extent no such time periods are specified in the relevant Security Document)
within the time periods specified by applicable law in order to ensure due perfection;

(2) the provisions of each Security Document will not be unduly burdensome on DGHL and its
Restricted Subsidiaries or interfere unreasonably with the operation of its business, will be limited to
those required by local law to perfect the Lien and will not impose commercial obligations;

(3) save where it is inappropriate under applicable law, Liens will not be enforceable until the Notes
have been accelerated as set out under “—Events of Default”;

(4) representations and undertakings shall be strictly limited to those necessary for the creation,
perfection or maintenance of the Lien (and other matters to be agreed (all parties acting reasonably))
with respect to third party Liens given by the direct Parent Entity and shall not be included to the
extent that the subject matter thereof is the same as the corresponding representation or undertaking
in the Senior Facilities Agreement;

(5) information, such as lists of assets, will be provided if, and only to the extent required by local law to
be provided to perfect or register the Lien and, when required, shall be provided no more frequently
than annually (unless required more frequently by local law) or, following an Event of Default which
is continuing, on the Security Agent’s reasonable request;

(6) Liens will, where practicable and legally possible, automatically create security over future assets of
the same type as those already secured; where local law requires supplemental pledges to be
delivered in respect of future acquired assets in order for effective Liens to be created over that class
of assets, such supplemental pledges shall be provided no more frequently than annually (unless
required more frequently under local law or where required to create valid security of equivalent
strength and ranking as that expressed to be created pursuant to the supplemental pledge or any
existing Lien);

(7) in respect of the share pledges, the customary limitations on the exercise of voting rights to the
extent these purport to protect the validity and enforceability of the Liens over shares shall apply. In
addition, until the Notes have been accelerated as set out under “Events of Default”, the pledgors will
be permitted to retain and to exercise voting rights to any shares pledged by them in a manner which
does not adversely affect the validity or enforceability of the Liens or cause an Event of Default to
occur and the pledgors will be permitted to pay dividends upstream on pledged shares to the extent
permitted by the Indenture;

(8) no control arrangements or perfection by control shall be required with respect to U.S. collateral
other than with respect to certificated equity interests of other Guarantors and Significant
Subsidiaries; and

(9) each party to a Security Document other than the Issuer or a Guarantor shall only be able to exercise
a power of attorney after (i) notice of intention to enforce has been given following the occurrence of
an Event of Default which is continuing or (ii) if the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor has failed to
comply with a further assurance or perfection obligation (and any grace period applicable thereto has
expired), but, in the case of (ii), only to the extent necessary in order to complete such further
assurance or perfection requirement.

The Issuer and each Guarantor shall be free to deal with any assets over which it grants Liens (to the extent
not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture) until the Notes have been accelerated as set out under “Events of
_Default”._

**_Priority_**

The Collateral also secures liabilities under the 2022 Notes, the Senior Facilities Agreement, the 2018
Bridge Facility Agreement and the Secured Trading Line. In addition, subject to certain conditions, including
compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and
“—Certain covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the Issuer is permitted to grant security over the Collateral in
connection with future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries, including certain Hedging
Obligations and any Additional Notes, in each case, as permitted under the Indenture, the 2022 Indenture, the

228


-----

Senior Facilities Agreement, the 2018 Bridge Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the Security
Documents (the “Security Interests”) as between (in no particular order) (a) the lenders under the Senior
Facilities Agreement, (b) the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations (including the obligations under
the Secured Trading Line), (c) certain other Indebtedness entitled to be secured by the Collateral, including
Indebtedness entitled to priority on enforcement, (d) Holders of the Notes, (e) holders of the 2022 Notes, (f) the
lenders under the 2018 Bridge Facility Agreement and (g) the Trustee, certain other creditor representatives and
the Security Agent, respectively, is established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, which provides,
among other things, that the obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the 2018 Bridge Facility
Agreement, certain Hedging Obligations (including the obligations under the Secured Trading Line), the 2022
Notes and the Notes are secured on a pari passu basis by first-priority Security Interests; provided, however, that
the Holders of the Notes, the holders of the 2022 Notes and the lenders under the 2018 Bridge Facility
Agreement will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral and certain distressed disposals only
after the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement, counterparties to certain Hedging Obligations (including
the obligations under the Secured Trading Line), lenders or creditors under certain other Indebtedness permitted
to be Incurred on a super priority basis under the Indenture and certain amounts owing to the Security Agent, any
receiver and certain creditor representatives (including the Trustee) have been repaid and discharged in full. The
Indenture, the 2022 Indenture, the 2018 Bridge Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement will restrict
the ability of the Holders or the Trustee to enforce the Security Interests and provide for the release of the
Security Interests created by the Security Documents in certain circumstances upon enforcement by the lenders
under the Senior Facilities Agreement and certain hedge counterparties (including the hedge counterparties under
the Secured Trading Line). The ability to enforce may be restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future
Indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral in compliance with the Indenture, the 2022 Indenture, the 2018
Bridge Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. See
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related
_to the Notes, the Guarantees and Our Capital Structure—Creditors under the New Senior Facilities, certain_
_hedging obligations and other priority debt are entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in_
_any enforcement sale in priority to the Notes”._

The Collateral (other than the Scottish Collateral) is also subject to second-priority Liens in favour of the
pension trustees for the Drax Power Group under the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme (the “Second Ranking
**Security”). In connection with the granting of the Second Ranking Security, the pension trustees, Deutsche Bank**
AG, London Branch, as security agent, DGHL and certain of its subsidiaries have entered into an amended and
restated second ranking security priority deed (the “Pension Trustee Priority Deed”). The Pension Trustee
Priority Deed provides, among other things, that (i) the Security Interests constituted by the Security Documents,
which secure the Notes, the 2022 Notes, the Senior Facilities Agreement, the 2018 Bridge Facility Agreement
and certain hedging obligations (including the obligations under the Secured Trading Line), shall rank senior in
order of priority to the Second Ranking Security; (ii) prior to the discharge of the Notes, the 2022 Notes, the
Senior Facilities Agreement, the 2018 Bridge Facility Agreement and certain hedging obligations (including the
obligations under the Secured Trading Line) secured by the Collateral, the pension trustees shall not take any
action to enforce the Second Ranking Security without the prior written consent of the Security Agent and
(iii) the Second Ranking Security shall not be amended in a manner which might reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the interests of the Security Agent or the security constituted by the Security Documents, except
with the prior written consent of the Security Agent. It is anticipated that the pension trustees will be granted
second-priority liens in respect of the Scottish Collateral on or after the Issue Date. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Pension Trustee Priority Deed”._

**_Security Documents_**

Under the Security Documents, DG plc, the Issuer and the Guarantors have granted or confirmed, or will
grant or confirm, security over the Collateral to secure the payment when due of, among others, the Issuer’s and
the Guarantors’ payment obligations under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Indenture. The Security
Documents have been or will be entered into by the relevant security provider and the Security Agent as agent for
the secured parties. When entering into the Security Documents, the Security Agent acts in its own name, but for
the benefit of the secured parties (including the Trustee and the Holders of Notes from time to time). Under the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent also acts as security agent of the lenders under the Senior Facilities
Agreement, the 2018 Bridge Facility Agreement, the holders of the 2022 Notes and the counterparties under

229


-----

certain Hedging Obligations (including the obligations under the Secured Trading Line) in relation to the
Security Interests created in favour of such parties.

The Indenture provides that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes and the Note Guarantees, as applicable, have been or will be secured by the
Security Interests in the Collateral. However, the Security Interests with respect to the Notes and the Note
Guarantees may be released under certain circumstances as provided under “—Release of Liens” below. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and Our Capital Structure—Creditors under the
_Senior Facilities, certain hedging obligations and other priority debt are entitled to be repaid with the proceeds_
_of the Collateral sold in any enforcement sale in priority to the Notes.” and “—Holders of the Notes will not_
_control decisions regarding the Collateral in certain circumstances”. The validity and enforceability of the_
Security Interests is subject to, inter alia, the limitations described in “Certain Insolvency Considerations and
_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and Security”._

Holders of the Notes may not, individually or collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights in
their favour under the applicable Security Documents. The Holders of the Notes may only act through the
Security Agent in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement.

In the event that the Issuer, the Guarantors, DGHL or its other Subsidiaries enter into insolvency,
bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the Security Interests created under or confirmed by the Security Documents
or the rights and obligations enumerated in the Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges.
If any challenge to the validity of the Security Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement were
successful, the Holders of Notes might not be able to recover any amounts under the Security Documents. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and Our Capital Structure—The Collateral may not
_be sufficient to secure the obligations under the Notes”._

Subject to the terms of the Indenture, the relevant Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Issuer and the Guarantors have or will have the right to remain in
possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Notes, to freely operate the property and
assets constituting Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom (including any and all
dividends, distributions or similar cash and non-cash payments in respect of Capital Stock of the Guarantors that
is part of the Collateral).

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Security Documents; Agreement to be Bound_**

The Indenture provides that each Holder of the Notes, by accepting such Note, will be deemed to have:

(1) consented and agreed to the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement entered into in compliance with the covenant described under
“—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements” (including, without limitation, the
provisions providing for foreclosure and release of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral, including
upon an enforcement, and authorising the Security Agent to enter into the Security Documents on its
behalf), as the same may be in effect or may be amended from time to time in accordance with its
terms;

(2) authorised the Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, to enter into the Security Documents
and, if applicable, to accede to the Intercreditor Agreement and to be bound thereby and to perform
their respective obligations and exercise their respective rights thereunder in accordance therewith;
and

(3) have appointed and authorised the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in
the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

Please see the section entitled “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”.

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
entered into in compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor
_Agreements”._

-----

**_Release of Liens_**

DGHL, the Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors will be entitled to release Security Interests in respect of
the Collateral owned by DGHL, the Issuer or any such Subsidiary Guarantor under any one or more of the
following circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to (a) a Person that is not DGHL or a
Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to “—Certain Covenants—Merger and
_Consolidation”), if such sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described below_
under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” or (b) to DGHL
or any Restricted Subsidiary, provided that, in the case of this sub-clause (b), after giving pro forma
effect to such release, the relevant Collateral will become promptly subject to a substantially
equivalent Lien in favor of the Security Agent securing the Notes;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Note Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

(3) in respect of any Collateral, automatically, without any action by the Trustee, if the Lien granted in
favor of the Senior Facilities Agreement in respect of such Collateral is released (only to the extent
that there is no other Indebtedness secured by a Lien on the assets constituting such Collateral that
would result in the requirement for the Notes and/or the Note Guarantees to be secured on such
property or assets pursuant to the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitations on Liens”, it being understood that the foregoing limitation will not be applicable to the_
extent that such Indebtedness is secured by a Permitted Lien), provided that, for the purposes of this
provision only, clause (13) of the definition of “Permitted Liens” shall not apply and clause (16) of
the definition of “Permitted Liens” shall not apply to any Indebtedness that was outstanding on the
Original Issue Date;

(4) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(5) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or legal defeasance,
covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and
“—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(6) if DGHL designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock,
of such Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(7) in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(8) in connection with the granting of Liens on such property or assets, which may include Collateral, or
the sale of such property or assets, which may include Collateral, pursuant to a Qualified
Receivables Financing;

(9) as permitted by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—No Impairment of Security
_Interest”;_

(10) to release and/or re-take any Lien on any Collateral to the extent otherwise permitted by the terms of
the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, including as part of any Permitted Reorganisation;

(11) pursuant to the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation
_on Liens”; or_

(12) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture.

DG plc will be entitled to release the Security Interests in respect of the Collateral owned by it under the
circumstances described in clauses (3), (5), (7), (9), (10) and (12) of the preceding paragraph.

The Security Agent and the Trustee (to the extent action is required by it in order to effectuate such release)
will take all necessary action reasonably requested by the Issuer in writing to effectuate any release of Collateral
securing the Notes and the related Note Guarantees in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Document, subject
to customary protection and indemnities. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security
Agent without the consent of the Holders of Notes or any action on the part of the Trustee (unless action is
required by it to effect such release).

231


-----

**_New Proceeds Loan_**

Upon the issuance of the New Notes, the Issuer, as lender, and Drax Corporate Limited, as borrower, will
enter into the New Proceeds Loan Agreement pursuant to which the Issuer will loan to Drax Corporate Limited
the proceeds from the issuance of the Notes. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—The New
_Proceeds Loan”._

The New Proceeds Loan will be denominated in US dollars and will bear interest at a rate per annum at least
equal to the interest rate of the New Notes. Interest on the New Proceeds Loan will be payable in cash semiannually, concurrently with or prior to the relevant interest payment date for the New Notes. The maturity date of
the New Proceeds Loan will be the same date as the maturity date of the New Notes. The New Proceeds Loan
will be an unsecured obligation of Drax Corporate Limited.

Except as otherwise required by law, all payments under the New Proceeds Loan Agreement will be made
without deductions or withholding for, or on account of, any applicable Tax. In the event that Drax Corporate
Limited is required to make any such deduction or withholding, it shall gross-up each payment to the Issuer to
ensure that the Issuer retains a net payment equal to the payment which it would have received had no such
deduction or withholding been made.

The New Proceeds Loan Agreement will provide that Drax Corporate Limited will make all payments
pursuant thereto on a timely basis in order to ensure that the Issuer can satisfy its payments obligations under the
New Notes and the Indenture, taking into account the administrative and timing requirements under the Indenture
with respect to amounts payable on the New Notes.

The New Proceeds Loan will be assigned by way of security to the Security Agent for the benefit of the
holders of the Notes, the holders of the 2022 Notes, the creditors under the Senior Facilities Agreement, certain
hedging obligations (including the obligations under the Secured Trading Line) and the lenders under the 2018
Bridge Facility Agreement on a first priority basis.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as described below and except as described under “—Redemption for Taxation Reasons”, the Notes
are not redeemable until 1 May 2021.

At any time prior to 1 May 2021, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 40 per cent. of
the original principal amount of the Notes (including the original principal amount of the New Notes and any
Additional Notes), upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, with funds in an aggregate amount not
exceeding the Net Cash Proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings at a redemption price of 106.625% of the
principal amount of the Notes so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to,
but not including, the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided that:

(1) at least 50 per cent. of the original principal amount of the Notes (including the original principal
amount of the New Notes and any Additional Notes) issued under the Indenture remain outstanding
after each such redemption; and

(2) the redemption occurs within 180 days after the closing of such Equity Offering.

At any time prior to 1 May 2021, the Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, part of the Notes upon not
less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice at a redemption price equal to 100 per cent. of the principal amount of
the Notes, plus the Applicable Premium plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but
not including, the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

**_Optional Redemption upon Certain Tender Offers_**

In connection with any tender offer for, or other offer to purchase, all of the Notes, in the event that holders
of not less than 90 per cent. of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not
validly withdraw such Notes in such tender offer or offer to purchase and the Issuer or a third party making such
tender offer or offer to purchase all the Notes held by such holders, within 60 days of such purchase, the Issuer
will have the right, upon not less than 10 and no more than 60 days’ prior notice, to redeem all (but not less than
all) the Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price equal to the highest price
(excluding any early tender premium or similar payment) paid to each other holder in such tender offer or offer
to purchase, plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer or offer to purchase payment, accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the date of such redemption (subject to the right of Holders of record
on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date).

**_General_**

Subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the
Issuer may repurchase Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or otherwise.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below.

If the Issuer effects an optional redemption of any Notes, it will, for so long as such Notes are listed on the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, inform the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange of such optional redemption and confirm the aggregate principal amount of the
Notes that will remain outstanding immediately after such redemption.

Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes
or portions thereof called for redemption on and after the redemption date. If the optional redemption date is on
or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest
will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and
no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes are subject to redemption by the Issuer.

In connection with any redemption of any Notes (including with the proceeds from an Equity Offering), any
such redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent. In addition, if
such redemption or notice is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice may state
that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions
shall be satisfied (provided, however, that, in any case, such redemption date shall be no more than 60 days from
the date on which such notice is first given, except that redemption notices may be given more than 60 days prior
to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and
discharge of the Indenture), or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that
any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so
delayed.

**Sinking Fund**

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect
to the Notes.

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or the Registrar will select the
Notes for redemption in compliance with the requirements of the principal securities exchange, if any, on which

233


-----

such Notes are listed, and in compliance with the applicable procedures of DTC, or if such Notes are not so listed
or such exchange prescribes no method of selection and such Notes are not held through DTC, or DTC prescribes
no method of selection, on a pro rata basis (or, in the case of Notes issued in global form as discussed under
“Book-Entry; Delivery and Form”, based on a method that most nearly approximates a pro rata selection);
_provided, however, that no such partial redemption shall reduce the outstanding aggregate principal amount of_
any Note not redeemed to less than $200,000. None of the Paying Agent, the Registrar or the Trustee will be
liable for any selections made in accordance with this paragraph.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notice of redemption in a daily newspaper with general
circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner
permitted by such rules, post such notice on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
(www.bourse.lu). In addition to such publication, if such Notes are in definitive certificated form, not less than 10
nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, the Issuer will mail such notice to Holders by first-class mail,
postage prepaid, at their respective addresses as they appear on the registration books of the Registrar (with a
copy to the Trustee and the Paying Agent).

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the
portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a Definitive Registered Note, a new
Definitive Registered Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of any Definitive Registered
Note redeemed in part will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original
Definitive Registered Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Global
Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to
the terms of the redemption notice, Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On
and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes called for redemption.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor
more than 60 days’ prior notice to the Holders of the Notes (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption
price equal to 100 per cent. of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to
the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts (as
defined below under “—Withholding Taxes”), if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax
Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if the Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result
of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any amendment to, or change in, an official application, administration or interpretation of such
laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent
jurisdiction or a change in published practice or revenue guidance) (each of the foregoing in clauses
(1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”), a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the next interest payment
date in respect of the Notes would be, required to pay Additional Amounts with respect to the Notes
(but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made
by the Issuer or another Guarantor who can make such payment without the obligation to pay
Additional Amounts), and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures
available to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent
where this would be reasonable). Such Change in Tax Law must be formally announced and become
effective on or after the Original Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Tax Jurisdiction became a
Relevant Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the Original Issue Date, such later date). The foregoing
provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is obligated to make
at least one payment on the Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such
successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring
after the time such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described
under “—Selection and Notice”. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given
earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of
Additional Amounts and unless at the time such notice is given, the obligation to pay Additional Amounts

234


-----

remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of any Notes pursuant to the
foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such
redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem
have been satisfied and that the Issuer or relevant Guarantor (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment
giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or another Guarantor without the obligation to pay
Additional Amounts) cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures
available to it and (b) a written opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognised standing qualified under the
laws of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee to the effect that the Payor has
been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will
accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the
satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be
conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including, in each case, any successor
entity) (each, a “Payor”) in respect of the Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee, as applicable, will be
made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the
withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on
account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note is made, or any political
subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax, by or on behalf of
any Payor or the Paying Agent; or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is organised, engaged in business for tax purposes, or
otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental
authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing
**Jurisdiction”),**

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor or the
Paying Agent with respect to any Note or Note Guarantee, including payments of principal, redemption price,
interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the
“Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments,
after such withholding, or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding from such Additional
Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been received in respect of such payments on any
such Note or Note Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no such
Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former
connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member,
partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an
estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or
resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in, or
being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any
connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Note or a Note
Guarantee or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Note,
the Indenture or a Note Guarantee;

(2) any Tax that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner of
the Note to comply with a written request of the Payor addressed to the Holder, after reasonable
notice (such notice to be provided at least 30 days before any such withholding or deduction would
be made), to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the
nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration
or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required
by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a
precondition to exemption from all or part of such Tax but only to the extent the Holder or beneficial
owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of the Note for
payment (where the Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and presentation is

235


-----

required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the
Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the
Notes been presented on the last day of such 30 day period);

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment on or with
respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other
governmental charge;

(6) any withholding or deduction required pursuant to section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) or otherwise imposed pursuant to sections 1471 through
1474 of the Code (or any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable and not
more onerous to comply with), any current or future regulations or agreements thereunder, official
interpretations thereof, any intergovernmental agreement entered into in connection therewith, or
any law, regulation or other official guidance enacted in any other jurisdiction implementing any
such intergovernmental agreement; or

(7) any combination of the items (1) through (6) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership
or any person other than the beneficial owner of the Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settler with
respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to
Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner held such Notes directly.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the relevant taxing authority in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law.
The Payor will use all reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any
Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes and will provide
such certified copies, or if, notwithstanding the Payor’s reasonable efforts to obtain such tax receipts, such tax
receipts are not available, certified copies of other reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably
practicable to the Trustee. Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will
be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent. The Payor will attach to each certified copy a certificate or
other reasonable evidence stating that the amount of withholding Taxes evidenced by the certified copy was paid
in connection with payments in respect of the principal amount of Notes then outstanding or any interest with
respect thereto.

If any Payor in good faith becomes aware that it is obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with
respect to any payment made on any Note or any Note Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such
payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts
will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the
Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay
Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may
deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment
date). The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely, without further inquiry, on such Officer’s Certificate as
conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of Notes” there is mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Note Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context,
Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay or reimburse the Holders or beneficial owners, the Trustee and the Paying Agent for any
present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including
any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar
charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction (or, in the case of enforcement, any jurisdiction) from the execution, delivery, registration or

236


-----

enforcement of, or receipt of payments with respect to, any Notes, any Note Guarantee, the Indenture, or any
other document or instrument in relation thereto and upon the original issuance and initial resale of the Notes
(other than in each case, in connection with a transfer of the Notes after this offering (other than the initial resale
by the Initial Purchasers) and limited, solely to the extent of such taxes or similar charges or levies that arise
from the receipt of any payments of principal or interest on the Notes, to any such taxes or similar charges or
levies that are not excluded under any of clauses (1) through (3) and (5) through (6) of the proviso of the first
paragraph under this heading “Withholding Taxes”, or any combination thereof).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, transfer by
a Holder or a beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a
Payor is organised, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any
jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to, the Notes or the Note Guarantees is
made by or on behalf of such Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms of the covenant described under this heading “Change of
_Control”, each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part (equal to $200,000 or_
integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof, provided that Notes of $200,000 or less may only be redeemed in
whole and not in part) of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101 per cent. of the principal
amount of the Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not
including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be obligated to
repurchase any Notes as described under this heading “Change of Control”, in the event and to the extent that it
has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of the Notes and given notice of redemption as described
under “—Optional Redemption” and that all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes and given notice of
redemption as described under “—Optional Redemption” and all conditions to such redemption have been
satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will send a
notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to the Paying Agent (with a copy to the Trustee) who will send such
notice to each Holder of any Notes:

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to
require the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal
to 101 per cent. of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of
Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the
“Change of Control Payment”);

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the
date such notice is mailed) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) stating that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to
accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Payment is not
paid, and that any Notes or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest;

(4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that
constitute the Change of Control;

(5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must
follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and

(6) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of
Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the
extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control
Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all
Notes or portions thereof so tendered; and

237


-----

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal
amount of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control
Offer.

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of
Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee (or an
authenticating agent) will, at the cost of the Issuer, promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by
book-entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal
amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in
a principal amount that is at least $200,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of such exchange so
require, the Issuer will publish notices relating to the Change of Control Offer in a daily newspaper with general
circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner
permitted by such rules, post such notices on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
(www.bourse.lu).

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions
that permit the Holders to require the Issuer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover,
recapitalisation or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase such
Holder’s Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire
DGHL or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer with respect to the Notes upon a Change
of Control or repurchase any Notes as described under this heading “Change of Control” if (1) a third party
makes the Change of Control Offer for the Notes in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with
the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and
purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (2) a notice of
redemption in respect of the Notes has been given in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer with respect to any Notes
may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control
if a definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer
is made.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the U.S.
Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to
this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of
the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed
to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such
compliance.

The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number
of factors. The occurrence of certain events that constitute a Change of Control would require a mandatory
prepayment of Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the 2022 Indenture. In addition, certain
events that may constitute a change of control under the Senior Facilities Agreement and require a mandatory
prepayment of Indebtedness under such agreement may not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture.
Future Indebtedness of DGHL or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would
constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control.
Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a
default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to
the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a
repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources, including the financial resources of
DGHL and its Restricted Subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when
necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and
_Our Capital Structure—The Issuer may not be able to finance a change of control offer”._

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition, in one or a series of related transactions, of all
or substantially all of the assets of DGHL and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other
Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all” there is no
precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain
circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a
disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of DGHL and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as

238


-----

a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may
require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes
as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority
in outstanding principal amount of the Notes.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

DGHL will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness (including
Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that DGHL and any Restricted Subsidiary may Incur Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness) if on the date of such Incurrence, after giving pro forma effect to the
Incurrence of such Indebtedness (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), for the most recently
ended two full fiscal half-years for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the
date on which such Indebtedness is Incurred, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for DGHL and its Restricted
Subsidiaries would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness
(“Permitted Debt”):

(1) Indebtedness Incurred by DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to any Credit Facility
(including in respect of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances issued or created thereunder), and
any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and Guarantees in respect of such Indebtedness, in a
maximum aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not exceeding (i) £350.0 million plus
(ii) in the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (1) or any portion
thereof, the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and
expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(2) (a) Guarantees by DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of DGHL or any
Restricted Subsidiary, so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness being guaranteed is
permitted to be Incurred by another provision of this covenant; provided that, if the
Indebtedness being guaranteed is subordinated to or pari passu with the Notes or a Note
Guarantee, then the guarantee must be subordinated to or pari passu with the Notes or such
Note Guarantee to the same extent as the Indebtedness being guaranteed; or

(b) without limiting the covenant described under “—Limitation on Liens”, Indebtedness arising
by reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person securing Indebtedness of DGHL
or any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted under
the terms of the Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of DGHL owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however,
that:

(a) if the Issuer or a Guarantor is the obligor on any such Indebtedness and the lender is not the
Issuer or a Guarantor, such Indebtedness is (i) unsecured and (ii) expressly subordinated in
right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of all obligations with respect to the
Notes, in the case of the Issuer, or the applicable Note Guarantee, in the case of a Guarantor to
the extent legally permitted (DGHL and the Restricted Subsidiaries having completed all
procedures required in the reasonable judgment of directors or officers of the obligee or
obligor to protect such Persons from any penalty or civil or criminal liability in connection
with the subordination of such Indebtedness), except, in the case of this clause (ii), in respect
of the intercompany current liabilities Incurred in the ordinary course of business or in
connection with the cash management operations of DGHL and the Restricted Subsidiaries or
if the aggregate amount of such Indebtedness of the Issuer or Guarantor does not exceed
£10.0 million; and

(b) (x) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in
any such Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than DGHL or a Restricted
Subsidiary and (y) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person other than
DGHL or a Restricted Subsidiary, shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of

239


-----

such Indebtedness not permitted by this clause (3) by DGHL or such Restricted Subsidiary, as
the case may be;

(4) (a) Indebtedness represented by the Initial Notes (other than any Additional Notes) and the related
Note Guarantees (including any future Note Guarantees) and any related “parallel debt” obligations
under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security
Documents, (b) any Indebtedness of DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Indebtedness
Incurred under the Senior Facilities Agreement or Indebtedness described in clause (3) of this
paragraph) outstanding on the Original Issue Date after giving effect to the Original Transactions,
(c) Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness described in clauses (4)(a),
(4)(b), (4)(c) and (5) of this paragraph or Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant,
(d) Management Advances, (e) any loan or other instrument contributing the proceeds of the Notes

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness
described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, DGHL, in its sole discretion, will
classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to
include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one (or more, if applicable) of the clauses of the
second paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant;

(2) all Indebtedness Incurred under the Senior Facilities Agreement on the Original Issue Date shall be
deemed initially Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant and may not be
reclassified;

(3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the
determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (7),
(11) or (12) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit,
bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other
Indebtedness shall not be included;

242


-----

(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of DGHL or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred
Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption
or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the
liquidation preference thereof;

(6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision
permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one
or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(7) subject to the provision described under “—Financial Calculation” below, for the purposes of
determining “Total Assets” in relation to clauses (7) and (12) of the second paragraph of this
covenant, Total Assets shall (in case of revolving facilities) be measured at the option of DGHL on
the most recent date on which the commitments are obtained or the date on which the new
Indebtedness is incurred and (in the case of term facilities) the date on which new Indebtedness is
incurred by reference to the balance sheet date of the most recent fiscal half-year for which internal
consolidated financial statements of DGHL are available; and

(8) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be
equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS.

In any case where the amount of Indebtedness that may be incurred pursuant to any clause in the second
paragraph of this covenant is or may be based on Total Assets, the amount that may be Incurred under such
clause shall be deemed to include all amounts necessary to renew, refund, refinance, replace, defease or
discharge any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to such clause.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortisation of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends
in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments
or obligations treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of
Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness”. Except as
otherwise specified, the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be the principal amount, or
liquidation preference thereof.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of DGHL as of such date (and, if such
Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this
“—Limitation on Indebtedness”, the Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any sterling-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Sterling Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency
shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was
Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a
revolving credit facility; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness
denominated in a currency other than sterling, and such refinancing would cause the applicable sterlingdenominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date
of such refinancing, such sterling-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as
the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the
definition of Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the Sterling Equivalent of the principal amount of any such
Indebtedness outstanding on the Original Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange
rate in effect on the Original Issue Date; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different
currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to sterling) covering principal amounts payable on
such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in sterling will be adjusted to take into account
the effect of such agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that DGHL or
a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result
of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to
refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be
calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing
Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

from members of management, directors, employees or consultants of any Parent Entity, DGHL or
Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with a repurchase of Capital Stock of DGHL or any Parent

other provision of the Indenture;

otherwise to facilitate any dividend or other return of capital to the holders of such Capital Stock (as
determined in good faith by an Officer of DGHL);

(12) Restricted Payments in an aggregate amount outstanding at any time not to exceed the aggregate

clause (14) shall not exceed the Net Cash Proceeds received by DGHL or the aggregate amount
contributed in cash to the equity of DGHL, or contributed as Subordinated Shareholder Funding to

exceed 3.00 to 1.0 on a pro forma basis after giving effect thereto;

£100.0 million and 2.85% of Total Assets; and

(18) dividends, loans, distributions, advances or other payments by DGHL or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to or on behalf of a Parent Entity to service the substantially concurrent payment of
regularly scheduled interest amounts (including any additional amounts required to be paid by reason
of a deduction or withholding for or on account of Tax) on Indebtedness the proceeds of which have
been contributed to DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary as a Parent Debt Contribution and that has
been guaranteed by, or is otherwise considered Indebtedness of, DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary
Incurred in accordance with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of such
Restricted Payment of the assets or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by DGHL or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value of any
cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount. The fair market value of property or assets other than cash
covered by the preceding sentence shall be the fair market value thereof as determined in good faith by an
Officer of DGHL, or, if such fair market value exceeds the greater of £15.0 million and 0.45% of Total Assets,
by the Board of Directors of DGHL.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, DGHL will be entitled to divide and classify
any Permitted Payment (or portion thereof) that meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted
Payments described in clauses (1) through (18) of the definition of Permitted Payments, Restricted Payments
made pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant or Permitted Investment on the date of its payment or later
reclassify (based on circumstances existing on the date of such reclassification) such Permitted Payment,
Restricted Payment or Permitted Investment (or portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant,
including in each case as an Investment pursuant to one or more of the clauses contained in the definition of
“Permitted Investment” and may aggregate capacity in multiple clauses of the definition of Permitted Payments
above, the first paragraph of this covenant and/or in the definition of “Permitted Investment” in any manner that
complies with this covenant.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

DGHL will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or
suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary),
whether owned on the Original Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any income or
profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except (a) in the case
of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets
that are not Permitted Liens if the obligations under the Notes and the Indenture are directly secured, subject to
the Agreed Security Principles, equally and rateably with, or prior to, in the case of Liens with respect to
Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so
secured, and (b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favour of the Notes pursuant to clause (a)(2) above will be automatically and
unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates
and (ii) otherwise as set forth under “—Security—Release of Liens”.

For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of determining compliance with any pound sterling-denominated
restriction on the incurrence of any Lien where the Indebtedness secured by such Lien is denominated in a
different currency, the amount of such Indebtedness shall be the Sterling Equivalent determined on the date of
such determination; provided, however, that if any such Indebtedness is Indebtedness that is denominated in a
different currency and is subject to a Currency Hedging Agreement (with respect to pounds sterling) covering
principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in pounds sterling
shall be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness secured by any Lien that DGHL or a Restricted Subsidiary may
incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded, with respect to any outstanding Indebtedness,
solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies or a decrease in Total Assets after such
Indebtedness is Incurred (and such Indebtedness will be permitted to be refinanced with other secured
Indebtedness and so secured notwithstanding that, after giving effect to such refinancing, such excess shall
continue).

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

DGHL will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit to exist
or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of (a) Drax Corporate
Limited or any successor borrower to make payments on the 2025 Notes Proceeds Loans or (b) any Restricted
Subsidiary to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock, or with
respect to any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits, or pay any Indebtedness
owed to DGHL or any other Restricted Subsidiary;

(B) make any loans or advances to DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary, provided
that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to
dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of
(including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to DGHL or any
Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary shall
not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Senior Facilities
Agreement, the 2022 Indenture and the Indenture), the Notes, the 2022 Notes, the Note Guarantees,
the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents or
(b) any other agreement or instrument, in each case described in (a) or (b), in effect at or entered into
on the Original Issue Date;

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating to any
Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which such Person
was acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into DGHL or any
Restricted Subsidiary, or on which such agreement or instrument is assumed by DGHL or any
Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or

249


-----

Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds utilised to
consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person became
a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by DGHL or was merged, consolidated or otherwise
combined with or into DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary and entered into or in connection with
such transaction) and outstanding on such date; provided that, for the purposes of this clause (2), if
another Person is the surviving entity or the resulting, surviving or transferee Person following the
acquisition by or merger, consolidation or combination with or into DGHL or any Restricted
Subsidiary (the “Successor Company”), any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of such
Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by DGHL or any Restricted
Subsidiary when such Person becomes the Successor Company; provided further, that, in the case of
Indebtedness, such Indebtedness was permitted to be Incurred under the Indenture;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a refinancing of
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument referred
to in clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3) (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in
any amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in clause (1) or (2) of
this paragraph or this clause (3); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with
respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less
favourable in any material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances and
restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or
amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as determined in good faith by an Officer of
DGHL);

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or
asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment or transfer of any
lease, license or other contract;

(b) contained in mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements permitted under the
Indenture or securing Indebtedness of DGHL or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted under the
Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the transfer of the property or
assets subject to such mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements; or

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in
any reciprocal easement agreements of DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalised Lease
Obligations permitted under the Indenture, in each case, that impose encumbrances or restrictions on
the property so acquired in the nature of those described in clause (c) of the preceding paragraph, or
any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to a joint venture agreement that imposes restrictions on the
distribution or transfer of the assets or Capital Stock of the joint venture;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its property or
assets) imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect sale or disposition to
a Person of all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary (or the
property or assets that are subject to such restriction) pending the closing of such sale or disposition;

(7) customary provisions in leases, licenses, joint venture agreements and other similar agreements and
instruments entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(8) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable rule,
regulation or order, or required by any regulatory authority;

(9) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers under
agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(10) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Currency Agreements, Interest Rate Agreements,
Inflation Agreements or Commodity Hedging Agreements;

(11) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument (a) relating to any
Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Original Issue Date pursuant to the
provisions of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if the encumbrances and
restrictions contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less

250


-----

favourable to the Holders of the Notes than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the
Senior Facilities Agreement, together with the Security Documents, and the Intercreditor Agreement,
in each case, as in effect on the Original Issue Date or (ii) as is customary in comparable financings
(as determined in good faith by an Officer of DGHL) or (b) constituting an Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

(12) restrictions effected in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing that, in the good faith
determination of an Officer of DGHL, are necessary or advisable to effect such Qualified
Receivables Financing; or (13) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any Lien
permitted under “—Limitation on Liens”.

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

DGHL will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any Asset Disposition unless:

(1) the consideration DGHL or such Restricted Subsidiary receives for such Asset Disposition is not less
than the fair market value of the assets sold (as determined by an Officer of DGHL); and

(2) at least 75% of the consideration DGHL or such Restricted Subsidiary receives in respect of such
Asset Disposition consists of:

(i) cash (including any Net Cash Proceeds received from the conversion within 180 days of such
Asset Disposition of securities, notes or other obligations received in consideration of such
Asset Disposition);

(ii) Cash Equivalents;

(iii) the assumption by the purchaser of (x) any liabilities recorded on DGHL’s or such Restricted
Subsidiary’s balance sheet or the notes thereto (or, if Incurred since the date of the latest
balance sheet, that would be recorded on the next balance sheet) (other than Subordinated
Indebtedness), as a result of which neither DGHL nor any of the Restricted Subsidiaries
remains obligated in respect of such liabilities or (y) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary
that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, if DGHL and
each other Restricted Subsidiary is released from any guarantee of such Indebtedness as a
result of such Asset Disposition;

(iv) Replacement Assets;

(v) any Capital Stock or assets of the kind referred to in clause (4) or (6) in the second paragraph
of this covenant;

(vi) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor received from Persons
who are not DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary, but only to the extent that such Indebtedness
(x) has been extinguished by the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor and (y) is not Subordinated
Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor;

(vii) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary,
having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash
Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at any one time outstanding, not to
exceed the greater of £100.0 million and 2.85% of Total Assets (with the fair market value of
each issue of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and
without giving effect to subsequent changes in value); or

(viii) a combination of the consideration specified in clauses (i) through (vii) of this clause (2).

If DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Disposition, the Net Available Cash of the
Asset Disposition, within 365 days (or 545 days in the circumstances described in clause (8) below) of the later
of (i) the date of the consummation of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash,
may be used by DGHL or such Restricted Subsidiary to:

(1) (i) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness Incurred under clause (1) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or any Refinancing
Indebtedness in respect thereof; provided, however, that, in connection with any prepayment,
repayment, purchase or redemption of Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (1), DGHL or such
Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will cause the related commitment (if any)

251


-----

(except in the case of any revolving Indebtedness including, but not limited to the revolving facility
made available under the Senior Facilities Agreement) to be permanently reduced in an amount
equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid, purchase or redeemed; (ii) unless included in the
preceding clause (1)(i), prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Indebtedness that is secured by a Lien on
the Collateral on a pari passu or super senior basis with the Notes at a price of no more than 100% of
the principal amount of such applicable Indebtedness, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
such prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption and applicable prepayment or redemption
premium; or (iii) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary of
DGHL that is not a Guarantor or any Indebtedness that is secured on assets which do not constitute
Collateral (in each case other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor or
Indebtedness owed to DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary);

(2) (a) purchase Notes pursuant to open market purchases or an offer to all Holders of the Notes, in each
case, at a purchase price in cash equal to at least 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued
and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase
(subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date), (b) redeem Notes pursuant to the optional redemption provisions of
the Indenture and/or (c) make an Asset Disposition Offer;

(3) invest in any Replacement Assets;

(4) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Similar Business, if,
after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Similar Business is or becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make a capital expenditure;

(6) acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock and cash or Cash Equivalents) that are used or useful
in a Similar Business;

(7) consummate any combination of the foregoing; or

(8) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Available Cash pursuant to clause (1), (3), (4), (5)
or (6) of this paragraph or a combination thereof; provided that a binding commitment shall be
treated as a permitted application of the Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment until
the earlier of (x) the date on which such investment or application is consummated and (y) the 180th
day following the expiration of the aforementioned 365-day period, if the investment or application
has not been consummated by that date.

The amount of such Net Available Cash not so used as set forth in the preceding paragraph constitutes
“Excess Proceeds”. Pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash, DGHL or any Restricted
Subsidiary may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in
any manner that is not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture.

On the 366th day after an Asset Disposition (or the 546th day if a binding commitment as described in
clause (8) above has been entered into), or such earlier time as the Issuer elects, if the aggregate amount of
Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of £60.0 million and 1.70% of Total Assets, the Issuer will be required
within 30 Business Days thereof to make an offer (an “Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders and, to the
extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum
principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies
that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to
(and, in the case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of
the Notes and 100% of the principal amount of Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
Indenture or the agreements governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum denominations
of $200,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof in the case of the Notes. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Issuer may make an Asset Disposition Offer prior to the expiration of the 365 (or 545, if applicable)
day period referred to above.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, DGHL or the
relevant Restricted Subsidiary may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes (including
making any Restricted Payment), subject to other covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal

252


-----

amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness
surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds
shall be allocated among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be repaid or purchased on a pro rata basis on
the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of
calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in sterling, such Indebtedness shall
be calculated by converting any such principal amounts into their Sterling Equivalent determined as of a date
selected by DGHL or the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon
completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a
currency other than the currency in which the Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of
such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Notes are denominated that is
actually received by DGHL or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary upon converting such portion of the Net
Available Cash into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, insofar as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of not less than
20 Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later than five
Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition Purchase
**Date”), the Issuer will repay the principal amount of Notes and, to the extent it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness**
required to be repaid or purchased by it pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if
less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness
validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment,
on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness or portions of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn
pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn and in minimum denominations of $200,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof in
the case of the Notes. The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Notes or
portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of this covenant. The
Issuer or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five Business Days
after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder an amount equal
to the purchase price of the Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted
by the Issuer for purchase, and the Issuer will promptly issue a new Note (or amend the Global Note), and the
Trustee (or an authenticating agent), upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will authenticate
and mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book entry) such new Note to such Holder, in a principal
amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered; provided that each such new Note will be in a
principal amount with a minimum denomination of $200,000. Any Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed
or delivered (or transferred by book entry) by the Issuer to the Holder thereof.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the U.S.
Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to
the Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of
this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed
to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

DGHL will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into or
conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any
property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of DGHL (any such transaction or series of related
transactions being an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of £15.0 million unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favourable to DGHL
or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable
transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such
transaction in arm’s-length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of £50.0 million, the
terms of such transaction or series of related transactions have been approved by a resolution of the
majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors of DGHL resolving that such
transaction complies with clause (1) above.

253

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Restricted Payments”, any Permitted Payments (other than pursuant to clause
(9)(b)(ii) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted
_Payments”) or any Permitted Investment (other than Permitted Investments as defined in paragraphs_
(1)(b), (2) and (14) of the definition thereof);

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, or
other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or
entering into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other compensation
arrangements, options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of DGHL, any Restricted
Subsidiary or any Parent Entity, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation
rights plans, participation plans or similar employee benefits or consultants’ plans (including
valuation, health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings or similar plans,
programs or arrangements) or indemnities provided on behalf of officers, employees, directors or
consultants approved by the Board of Directors of DGHL, in each case in the ordinary course of
business;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(4) any transaction between or among DGHL and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries or
any Receivables Subsidiary;

(5) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities and
employee benefit and pension expenses provided on behalf of, directors, officers, consultants or
employees of DGHL, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent Entity (whether directly or indirectly
and including through any Person owned or controlled by any of such directors, officers or
employees);

(6) (a) the Original Transactions, (b) the entry into and performance of obligations of DGHL or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries under the terms of any transaction pursuant to or contemplated by, and
any payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of or
on the Original Issue Date or described in “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions”
in the Original Offering Memorandum, as these agreements and instruments may be amended,
modified, supplemented, extended, renewed, replaced or refinanced from time to time in accordance
with the other terms of this covenant or to the extent not more disadvantageous to the Holders in any
material respect, and (c) the entry into and performance of any registration rights or other listing
agreement;

(7) without duplication, the execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement or any
arrangement or payment pursuant to which DGHL or any Affiliate of DGHL or any Restricted
Subsidiary is required or permitted to file a consolidated or combined Tax return, or the formation
and maintenance of any consolidated group for Tax, accounting or cash pooling or management
purposes in the ordinary course of business; provided that payment under such Tax Sharing
Agreement or arrangement shall not exceed, and shall not be duplicative of, the amounts described
under clause (7) of the term “Parent Expenses” and, that the related tax liability of DGHL and its
Restricted Subsidiaries will be relieved;

case, in the ordinary course of business, which are fair to DGHL or the relevant Restricted

have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among DGHL or any Restricted
Subsidiary and any Affiliate of DGHL or an Associate or similar entity that would constitute an
Affiliate Transaction solely because DGHL or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of DGHL or a
Restricted Subsidiary owns an equity interest in or otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or
similar entity;

**_Limitations on Amendments of the 2025 Notes Proceeds Loans; Payment of the 2025 Notes Proceeds Loans_**

Proceeds Loans; (2) reduce the rate of interest on the 2025 Notes Proceeds Loans; (3) change the currency for

and the Issuer shall accept such payments.

**_Maintenance of Listing_**

Each of the Issuer and the Guarantors will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the
listing of the Notes on the Euro MTF Market for so long as such Notes are outstanding; provided that if at any
time the Issuer determines that it is unable to list or it will not maintain such listing, it will obtain prior to the
delisting of the Notes from the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the withdrawal from the
trading of the Notes on the Euro MTF Market, and thereafter use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain,
a listing of such Notes on another “recognised stock exchange” as defined in Section 1005 of the Income Tax Act
2007 of the United Kingdom.

**_Reports_**

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee the following reports:

(1) within four months after the end of DGHL’s financial year, an annual financial report containing the
following information: (a) audited consolidated balance sheet of DGHL as of the end of the two
most recent financial years and audited consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow
of DGHL for the two most recent financial years, including complete footnotes to such financial
statements and the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements and (b) a
management report of DGHL containing a fair review of DGHL’s business and a description of the
principal risks and uncertainties facing DGHL, including an analysis of the development and
performance of DGHL’s business during the financial year, the position of DGHL’s business at the
end of that financial year, and financial and other key performance indicators to the extent necessary
for an understanding of the development, performance or position of DGHL’s business;

(2) within three months following the end of the second quarter in each of DGHL’s financial years,
reports containing the following information: (a) an unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet
as of the end of such half-year period and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow
for the year-to-date periods ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date, and the
comparable prior year periods for DGHL, together with condensed footnote disclosure and (b) an
interim management report of DGHL containing an indication of important events that have
occurred during the first six months of the financial year and their impact on the condensed set of
financial statements, and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining six
months of the financial year; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that DGHL announces publicly or any acquisition,
disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction that is material to DGHL and the
Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a change in Group Chief Executive, Chief Financial

256


-----

Officer or chairman of the Board of Directors of DGHL or a change in auditors of DGHL, a report
containing a description of such event.

In addition, the Issuer will furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of such
parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the U.S. Securities Act for so
long as the Notes are not freely transferable under the U.S. Exchange Act by persons who are not “affiliates”
under the U.S. Securities Act.

The Issuer will furnish to the Trustee such other information that DG plc is required to make publicly
available pursuant to applicable rules and regulations of the UK Listing Authority (or any successor regulator)
and the London Stock Exchange (the “UK Listed Company Requirements”) as a result of DG plc having its
ordinary shares admitted for trading on the London Stock Exchange. Upon the DGHL or any Parent Entity
complying with the UK Listed Company Requirements (regardless of whether the DG plc’s ordinary shares are
admitted for trading on the London Stock Exchange), to the extent that such requirements include an obligation
to prepare and make publicly available annual financial reports, information, documents and other reports in
accordance with the UK Listed Company Requirements, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the
provisions contained in clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph of this covenant, provided that, to the extent
that material differences exist between the management, business, assets, shareholding or results of operations or
financial condition of the Parent Entity that is the reporting entity and DGHL, a reasonably detailed description
of such differences shall be provided.

The Issuer will also make available to Holders and prospective Holders of the Notes copies of all reports
furnished to the Trustee on DG plc’s website and if and so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market thereof and, to the extent that the
rules and regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, copies of such reports furnished to the
Trustee will also be made available at the specified office of the listing agent in Luxembourg.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer will be deemed to have provided such information to the Trustee,
the holders of the Notes and prospective Holders of the Notes if such information referenced in the first
paragraph of this covenant or alternatively, the second preceding paragraph, has been posted to the Issuer’s, DG
plc’s or DGHL’s website.

All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of
such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis
for the periods presented, except as may otherwise be described in such information; provided, however, that the
reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) of the first paragraph of this covenant or the third paragraph of this
covenant may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods.
No report need include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of DGHL or any disclosure with respect
to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in the Original
Offering Memorandum. In addition, the reports set forth above will not be required to contain any reconciliation
to U.S. GAAP.

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to be material if it is a Class 1
Transaction.

At any time that any of DGHL’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries under the Indenture and any such
Unrestricted Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, would (if it were restricted)
constitute a Significant Subsidiary of DGHL, then the half-year and annual financial information required by the
first paragraph of this “Reports” covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of
the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of DGHL
and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted
Subsidiaries of DGHL.

In the event that (i) the Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the
U.S. Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports
required by Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Issuer elects to provide to the Trustee reports which, if filed
with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Issuer) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a)
or 15(d) of the U.S. Exchange Act (other than the provision of U.S. GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or
information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the
Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Issuer is, or would be, required to
file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d). Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the
Issuer and DGHL will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

Default or Event of Default exists;

(4) DGHL or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than DGHL),

(5) DGHL delivers to the Trustee, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, an
Officer’s Certificate stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental
indenture (if any) comply with this covenant and that all conditions precedent in the Indenture
relating to such transaction have been satisfied and that the Indenture and its Note Guarantee and the
2025 Notes Proceeds Loans (to the extent applicable) each constitute the legal, valid and binding
obligation of DGHL or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (as
applicable) enforceable in accordance with its terms.

In the event of any transaction described in and complying with the conditions listed in the immediately
preceding paragraph in which DGHL is not the continuing Person, the successor Person formed or remaining or
to which such transfer is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of
DGHL and DGHL will be (other than in the case of a lease of all or substantially all of its assets) discharged
from all obligations and covenants under the Indenture.

_The Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors_

The Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors (other than a Subsidiary Guarantor whose Note Guarantee is to be
released in accordance with the terms of the Note Guarantee and the Indenture as described under “—Note
_Guarantees”) will not, directly or indirectly: (i) consolidate or merge with or into another Person (whether or not_
the Issuer or such Subsidiary Guarantor, as applicable, is the surviving entity) or (ii) sell, assign, transfer, convey,
lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Issuer or such Subsidiary
Guarantor, as applicable, and its Subsidiaries that are Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or more
related transactions, to another Person, unless:

case of a merger or consolidation involving the Issuer or in connection with the sale, assignment,

258

entity organised or existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union, Switzerland,
Canada, any state of the United States or the District of Columbia;

(2) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Issuer or such
Subsidiary Guarantor, as applicable) or the Person to which such sale, assignment, transfer,

such Subsidiary Guarantor, as applicable, under the Notes (in the case of the Issuer), its Note
Guarantee (in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor), the Indenture, the 2025 Notes Proceeds Loans, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents to

(4) DGHL delivers to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to the Trustee) stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture
(if any) comply with this covenant and that all conditions precedent in the Indenture relating to such
transaction have been satisfied and that the Indenture, the Notes (in the case of the Issuer) and the
Note Guarantee (in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor) constitute legal, valid and binding
obligations of the Issuer, the Subsidiary Guarantor or the Person formed by or surviving any such
consolidation and merger (as applicable) enforceable in accordance with their terms, provided,
_however, that the prohibitions in this paragraph above (in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor) shall_
not apply to the extent that compliance with clause (1) could give rise to or result in: (a) any breach
or violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference,
thin capitalisation rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws, rules
and regulations (or analogous restrictions) of any applicable jurisdiction; (b) any risk or liability for

In the event of any transaction described in and complying with the conditions listed in the immediately
preceding paragraph in which the Issuer or such Subsidiary Guarantor, as applicable, is not the continuing
Person, the successor Person formed or remaining or to which such transfer is made shall succeed to, and be

This “Merger and Consolidation” covenant will not apply to (a) any consolidation or merger of any
Restricted Subsidiary of DGHL that is not a Guarantor into the Issuer or a Guarantor, (b) any consolidation or
merger among Guarantors (other than DGHL in the case that DGHL is not the surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger), (c) any consolidation or merger among Restricted Subsidiaries of DGHL that are not
Guarantors or the Issuer, and (d) any consolidation or merger among the Issuer and any Guarantor; provided that,
in the case of this clause (d) if the Issuer is not the surviving entity of such merger or consolidation, the relevant
Guarantor is an entity organised or existing under the laws of any member state of the Pre-Expansion European
Union, Switzerland, Canada, any state of the United States or the District of Columbia and such Guarantor shall
assume all of the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the 2025 Notes Proceeds Loans, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents to which the Issuer is a party
and, to the extent applicable, clauses (2) and (5) of the first paragraph under the caption “—DGHL” and clauses
(1) and (4) of the first paragraph under the caption “—The Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors” will be

259


-----

complied with. Clauses (3) and (4) of the first paragraph under the caption “—DGHL” and clause (3) of the first
paragraph under the caption “—The Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors” will not apply to any merger or
consolidation of the Issuer or any Guarantor with or into an Affiliate solely for the purpose of reincorporating the
Issuer or such Guarantor in another jurisdiction, to change its domicile or to change its legal form.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, DGHL and its Restricted Subsidiaries may
implement a Permitted Reorganisation.

**_No Impairment of Security Interest_**

DGHL shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or negligently omit to
take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security Interest with respect to the
Collateral (it being understood, subject to the proviso below, that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens
shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral)
for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders of Notes, and DGHL shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted
Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders of
Notes and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any Lien over any of the Collateral that is prohibited by the covenant
described above under the caption “—Limitation on Liens”, except that (i) DGHL and its Restricted Subsidiaries
may Incur Permitted Collateral Liens; (ii) the Collateral may be discharged and released in accordance with the
Indenture, the applicable Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, (iii) DGHL and its Restricted Subsidiaries may discharge and release Security Interests with respect
to the Collateral in connection with the implementation of a Permitted Reorganisation and (iv) the applicable
Security Documents may be amended from time to time (a) to cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect,
manifest error or inconsistency therein, (b) to comply with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (c) to add Collateral, (d) to evidence the succession of another Person to the
Issuer or any Guarantor and the assumption by such successor of the obligations under the Indenture, the Notes,
the Intercreditor Agreement and/or the Security Documents, in each case, including in accordance with
“—Merger and Consolidation,” (e) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of the appointment of a successor
Trustee or Security Agent and (f) in any manner that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material
respect; provided, however, that in the case of clause (i), the Security Documents may not be amended, extended,
renewed, restated, supplemented, released or otherwise modified or replaced (provided further, that a
confirmation agreement in respect of any Security Agreement shall not be deemed to be an amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release or other modification of that Security Document for
purposes of this covenant) unless contemporaneously with any such action, DGHL delivers to the Trustee, either
(1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee from an Independent
Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the relevant Person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after
giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement,
release, modification or replacement, (2) a certificate from the Board of Directors of the relevant Person, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, which confirms the solvency of the person granting such
Security Interest after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to
such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, the Lien or
Liens created under the Security Documents, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, released, supplemented,
modified or replaced are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening
period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement. In the event that
DGHL or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary complies with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the
Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such amendments
without the need for instructions from the Holders of Notes.

**_Additional Guarantees_**

DGHL will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to Guarantee the
Indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Facilities Agreement, any other Public Debt or any Refinancing
Indebtedness Incurred in respect of the foregoing, respectively, of the Issuer or a Guarantor, in each case, unless
such Restricted Subsidiary becomes a Guarantor on the date on which the Guarantee is Incurred and executes and
delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture providing for a Note Guarantee of such Restricted Subsidiary,
which Note Guarantee will be senior to or pari passu with such Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee of such other

260


-----

Indebtedness; provided, however, that such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be obligated to become such a
Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Note Guarantee is contrary to the Agreed
Security Principles or could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of general statutory limitations,
financial assistance, capital maintenance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference or thin capitalisation rules,
retention of title claims or the laws, rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction;
(2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a
partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a
partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or
obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

At the option of DGHL, any Note Guarantee may contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the extent
reasonably necessary to recognise certain defences generally available to guarantors or other considerations
under applicable law or regulation.

Note Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under “—Note
_Guarantees—Release of Note Guarantees”. A Note Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the_
option of DGHL if at the date of such release there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was
Incurred after the Original Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture
as at the date of such release if such Guarantor were not designated as a Guarantor as at that date. The Trustee
and the Security Agent shall each take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Note
Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications.

The validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of each
Guarantor is or will be subject to the limitations as described and set out under “Risk Factors”.

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture provides that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence by DGHL or its
Restricted Subsidiaries of any Indebtedness permitted to be secured pursuant to clause (b) of the definition of
Permitted Collateral Liens, DGHL, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall
enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorised Representatives) an intercreditor
agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) or a restatement, amendment or other modification of
the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not
materially less favourable to the Holders), including containing substantially the same terms with respect to
release of Note Guarantees and priority and release of the applicable Security Interests; provided that (a) such
Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security
Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties,
liabilities, indemnities or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent under the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement and (b) if more than one such intercreditor agreement is outstanding at any one time, the collective
terms of such intercreditor agreements must not conflict.

The Indenture also provides that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders, the
Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor
Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the
amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by DGHL or any
Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor
Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness
ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or
an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes), (5) to facilitate
a Permitted Reorganisation, (6) make provision for equal and rateable pledges of the Collateral to secure
Additional Notes, (7) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens, (8) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof or (9) make any other change to any
such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect. The Issuer shall not otherwise
direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement without the
consent of the Holders of the majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, except as
otherwise permitted below under “—Amendments and Waivers”, and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and
the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal
obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or the Security Agent, adversely
affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

261


-----

The Indenture also provides that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, prior to the taking of any Enforcement Action (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement), the Trustee (and the Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf
of the Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or
redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby; provided, however, that such transaction would
comply with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”.

The Indenture also provides that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and
accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
(whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have
directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement. A copy of
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement will be made available for inspection
during normal business hours on any Business Day upon prior written request at the Issuer’s offices or at the
offices of the listing agent.

**_Financial Calculations_**

When calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture, in each case in connection
with any acquisition, disposition, merger, joint venture, Investment or similar transaction where there is a time
difference between commitment and closing or Incurrence (including in respect of Incurrence of Indebtedness,
Restricted Payments, Permitted Payments, Permitted Investments and Permitted Liens), the date of determination
of any such basket or ratio and of any Default or Event of Default shall, at the option of the Issuer, be the date the
definitive agreements for such acquisition, disposition, merger, joint venture, Investment or similar transaction
are entered into, and such baskets or ratios shall be calculated on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such
acquisition, disposition, merger, joint venture, Investment or similar transaction and the other transactions to be
entered into in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof)
as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable period for purposes of determining the ability to
consummate any such transaction (and not for purposes of any subsequent availability of any basket or ratio),
and, for the avoidance of doubt, (1) if any of such baskets or ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such
basket or ratio (including due to fluctuations in Total Assets of DGHL or the target company) subsequent to such
date of determination and at or prior to the consummation of the relevant transaction, such baskets or ratios will
not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether
the transaction is permitted hereunder and (2) such baskets or ratios shall not be tested at the time of
consummation of such transaction or related transactions; provided, further, that if the Issuer elects to have such
determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement, any such transactions (including any
incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds therefrom) shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the
definitive agreements are entered and outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets or ratios
under the Indenture after the date of such agreement and before the consummation of such transaction.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Original Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on that day
and continuing until such time, if any, at which such Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (the
“Reversion Date”), the provisions of the Indenture summarised under the following captions will not apply to
such Notes:

(1) “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

(2) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(3) “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(4) “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

(5) “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;

(6) “—Additional Guarantees”; and

(7) the provisions of clause (4) of the covenant described under “—Merger and Consolidation—
DGHL”,

and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be
applicable to DGHL and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

262


-----

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first
day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with
regard to actions of DGHL properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and no action taken
prior to the Reversion Date will constitute a Default or Event of Default. The “Limitation on Restricted
_Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the Indenture but not during_
the continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the
continuance of the Suspension Event will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Original Issue Date, so that
it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Indebtedness”. In addition, the Indenture also permits, without causing a Default or Event of
Default, DGHL or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honour any contractual commitments or take actions in
the future after any date on which such Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long as the contractual
commitments were entered into during the Suspension Event and not in anticipation of such Notes no longer
having an Investment Grade Status. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee that the conditions set forth in the first
paragraph under this caption have been satisfied; provided that no such notification shall be a condition for the
suspension of the covenants described under this caption to be effective. There can be no assurance that such
Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Status.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Note issued under the Indenture when due and payable,
continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Notes issued under the
Indenture due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon
declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by DGHL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply for 60 days after notice by the
Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes with its other
agreements contained in the Indenture;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which
there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by DGHL or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by DGHL or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries) other than Indebtedness owed to DGHL or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such
Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the Original Issue Date, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately
upon the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”);
or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross acceleration
**provision”), and, in each case, either the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together**
with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a
payment default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates to £50.0 million
or more;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of DGHL or a Significant Subsidiary or
group of Restricted Subsidiaries of DGHL that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated
financial statements for DGHL), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy
**provisions”);**

(6) failure by DGHL or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries of DGHL that,
taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for DGHL), would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating to in excess of £50.0 million
(exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability for), which
judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment becomes
final (the “judgment default provision”);

(7) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and
effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture and except through the gross

263


-----

negligence or wilful misconduct of the Security Agent) with respect to Collateral having a fair
market value in excess of £15.0 million for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all
obligations under the Indenture or the release of any such security interest in accordance with the
terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the
Security Documents or any such security interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or
unenforceable or DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in writing that any such security
interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default continues for 10 days; and

(8) any Note Guarantee of a Guarantor ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance
with the terms of such Note Guarantee or the Indenture) or is declared invalid or unenforceable in a
judicial proceeding or any Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations under its Note
Guarantee and any such Default continues for 10 days.

However, a Default under clauses (3), (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default
until the Trustee or the Holders of 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture notify
the Issuer of the Default and, with respect to clauses (3), (4) and (6) the Issuer does not cure such Default within
the time specified in clauses (3), (4) or (6), as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the
outstanding Notes under the Indenture by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the
request of such percentage of Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid
interest on all the Notes under the Indenture to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal,
premium and accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default described
in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on
all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of
the Trustee or any Holders.

In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause
(4) under “Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be
automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to
clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave
rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of
acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with
any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except
non-payment of principal, premium or interest on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of
the Notes, have been cured or waived.

Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and
may not enforce the applicable Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all
past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to non-payment of principal, premium, interest
or Additional Amounts, if any, in respect of the Notes, a waiver of which would require the consent of 90% of
the Holders in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes under the Indenture) and rescind any such
acceleration with respect to the Notes and its consequences if such rescission would not conflict with any
judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs
and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the
Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders of the Notes unless such Holders have offered to the
Trustee customary indemnification, security or prefunding satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or
expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest or Additional
Amounts when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the
Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security, prefunding or customary indemnification satisfactory
to it against any loss, liability or expense;

264


-----

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the
offer of such security, prefunding or indemnification; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the
Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such
60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are
given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Indenture provides that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee
will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the
conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the
Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would
involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be
entitled to indemnification, security or prefunding satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses,
liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture provides that if a Default
occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed in writing of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must
give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a
Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold
notice if and so long as the Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The
Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee (and the Trustee shall be able to rely without further inquiry on),
within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof
know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver
to the Trustee (and the Trustee shall be able to rely without further inquiry on), within 30 days after the
occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults,
their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

The Indenture provides for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but
only if the Trustee is indemnified, prefunded or secured to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee
to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable
to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action
directly.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture provides that such Indenture, the Notes, the 2025 Notes
Proceeds Loan Agreements and the other Notes Documents relating to the Notes may be amended, supplemented
or otherwise modified with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of such Notes then
outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for,
such Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be
waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding
(including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, the Notes).
Without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% (or, in the case of clause (8), 75%) of the principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding, an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Notes held by a
non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of such Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, waiver or
modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Note or change the time at which any
such Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above under “—Optional Redemption”;

(5) make any such Note payable in money other than that stated in such Note;

(6) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect
to such Holder’s Notes or any Note Guarantee in respect thereof;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “Withholding Taxes” that
adversely affects the right of any Holder or beneficial owner of such Notes in any material respect or

265


-----

amends the terms of such Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the
Taxes described thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so
described thereunder unless the Issuer or the applicable Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if
any, in respect thereof;

(8) release (i) the pledge over the shares in DGHL and the Issuer, (ii) the security interest created over
Drax Corporate Limited’s or any successor borrower’s rights under the 2025 Notes Proceeds Loans
or (iii) all or substantially all security interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the
Collateral, in each case other than in accordance with the terms of the Security Documents, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Indenture;

(9) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the non-payment of principal, premium or
interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on such Notes (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration
of such Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a
waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

(10) release (i) DGHL or (ii) all or substantially all Guarantors from any of their respective obligations
under the Note Guarantee or the Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and
the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(11) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent
described in this sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, any Guarantor, the Trustee,
the Security Agent and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement the 2025 Notes
Proceeds Loan Agreements or any Notes Document relating to the Notes to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary under such Notes Document, including, without limitation, in connection with a
Permitted Reorganisation;

(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Note Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any
right or power conferred upon DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or
that does not adversely affect the rights or benefits of the Trustee or any of the Holders in any
material respect under such Notes Document;

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by an Officer of DGHL) for the
issuance of Additional Notes;

(6) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Note Guarantee, to add Note Guarantees with
respect to the Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the Notes, or to confirm and evidence the
release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Note Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral
and the Security Documents) or any amendment in respect thereof with respect to or securing the
Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking or amendment is provided for under the
Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

(7) conform the text of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Notes to any provision of the
“Description of Notes” section of the Original Offering Memorandum to the extent that such
provision in such “Description of Notes” section was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a
provision of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Notes;

(8) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee or the Security Agent
pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee or the Security
Agent to any Notes Document relating to such Notes;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest
in favour of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Senior Facilities
Agreement, in any property which is required by the Security Documents or the Senior Facilities
Agreement (as in effect on the Original Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in

266


-----

which a security interest is required to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to
grant a security interest in the Collateral for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of
such security interest is not prohibited by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—No
_Impairment of Security Interest” is complied with;_

(10) evidence or provide for the release of any Note Guarantee or any Lien on any Collateral that is
otherwise permitted by the terms of the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; or

(11) as provided in “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements”.

In formulating its decision on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely on
such evidence as it deems necessary, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment of the 2025 Notes Proceeds Loan Agreements or any other Notes Document. It is sufficient
if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver
under the Indenture by any Holder of the Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not
be rendered invalid by such tender.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of such exchange so
require, the Issuer will publish notice of any amendment, supplement and waiver in Luxembourg in a daily
newspaper with general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or, to the
extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notice on the official website of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu).

For the avoidance of doubt, no modification or amendment to, or deletion of, or actions taken in compliance
with, any of the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants” shall be deemed to impair or affect any rights
of the holders of the Notes to receive payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, the Notes.

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Notes have concurred in any
direction, waiver or consent, Notes owned by the Issuer or by any Person directly or indirectly controlled, or
controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the Issuer will be disregarded and deemed not to
be outstanding.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and
the Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain
obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and
indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning
issuing temporary Notes, registration of the Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance
of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the
Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the Security Documents and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders
under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate
(other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate its and the Guarantors’ obligations under the covenants described
under “—Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (1), (2) and (3) of the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—DGHL” and clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant described under_
“—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors”) and “—Change
_of Control” and the default provisions relating to such covenants described under “Events of Default” above, the_
operation of the cross-default upon a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy
provisions with respect to the Significant Subsidiaries (other than the Issuer), the judgment default provision, the
guarantee provision and the security default provision described under “Events of Default” above (“covenant
**defeasance”).**

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior
exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the
Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to such Notes. If the Issuer exercises

267


-----

its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of such Notes may not be accelerated because
of an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to clauses (1), (2) and (3) of the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—DGHL” and clauses (1) and (2) of the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer and the Subsidiary
_Guarantors”), (4), (5) (with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries (other than the Issuer)), (6), (7) or (8) under_
“Events of Default” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance
**trust”) with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed as agent by the Trustee for this purpose) cash**
in U.S. legal tender, U.S. Government Obligations or a combination thereof in an amount sufficient for the
payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be,
and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders and beneficial owners of the
relevant Notes will not recognise income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a
result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same
amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit
and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel
in the United States must be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change
in applicable U.S. federal income tax law);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of
defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or
relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with;
and

(4) all other documents or other information that the Trustee may reasonably require in connection
witheither defeasance option.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Documents, will be discharged and cease to be of
further effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Notes, as expressly
provided for in the Indenture) as to all outstanding Notes when (1) either (a) all such Notes previously
authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes, and certain Notes for which
provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been
delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation; or (b) all such Notes not previously delivered to the Paying Agent
for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity
within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Paying Agent in the name, and at the
expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another entity
designated or appointed as agent by the Trustee for this purpose) cash in US legal tender, US Government
Obligations or a combination thereof in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on
such Notes not previously delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and
interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity
or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under
the Indenture; (4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the funds deposited
towards the payment of such Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be; and (5) the Issuer
has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which the Trustee may rely on
without further inquiry) each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the “Satisfaction and Discharge”
section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with,
_provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to_
compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4)). If requested in writing by the Issuer to the Trustee
and Paying Agent (which request may be included in the applicable notice of redemption or pursuant to the
above referenced Officer’s Certificate) no later than five business days (or such shorter period as may be agreed
by the Trustee in its discretion) prior to such distribution, the Trustee shall distribute any amounts deposited to
the Holders prior to the Stated Maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be. For the avoidance of doubt,

268


-----

the distribution and payment to holders prior to the maturity or redemption date as set forth above will not
include any negative interest, present value adjustment, break cost or any additional premium on such amounts.
To the extent the Notes are represented by a global note deposited with a depositary for a clearing system, any
payment to the beneficial holders holding interests as a participant of such clearing system will be subject to the
then applicable procedures of the clearing system.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of DGHL or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates,
as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor under the 2025 Notes Proceeds
Loan Agreements or any other applicable Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason
of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The
waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to
waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against
public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

BNY Mellon Corporate Trustee Services Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The
Indenture provides that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee will perform only such
duties as are set forth specifically in such Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default, the Trustee will
exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care that a
prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain
from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Indenture imposes certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the
Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realise on certain property received in respect of any
such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee or any Agent is permitted to engage in other transactions with
DGHL and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture sets out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced. Such
terms include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Issuer
and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated, or
(b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the
Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six months may petition any court for
removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by
the successor Trustee.

The Indenture contains provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, expenses
Incurred without gross negligence, wilful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of the Indenture. Any obligations under the Indenture of The Bank of New York
Mellon SA/NV, Luxembourg Branch are subject to bail-in powers under the EU Bank Recovery and Resolution
Directive.

**Notices**

For so long as any of the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, notices of the Issuer with respect to the Notes will be published in a
daily newspaper with general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or if,
in the opinion of the Issuer such publication is not practicable, in an English language newspaper having general
circulation in Europe or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, such notices will be posted on
the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu). In addition, for so long as any Notes
are represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders of the Notes may be delivered by or on behalf of the
Issuer to DTC in lieu of notice via registered mail.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more
than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed,
such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after being so
mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or

269


-----

other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed.
Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with
respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given,
whether or not the addressee receives it.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the Notes
will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against the Issuer and the
Guarantors for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed six years after the applicable due date for
payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Pound Sterling-Denominated Restrictions**

The US dollar is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the
Guarantors under or in connection with the Notes and the Note Guarantees, if any, including damages. Any
amount received or recovered in any other currency, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or
order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by
any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a Guarantor will
only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the US dollar amount
that the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date
of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which
it is practicable to do so).

If such US dollar amount is less than the US dollar amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the
Trustee under any Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such
recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient or the
Trustee on a joint and several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this
currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Note
or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources of information
used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent
obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent
cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note or the Trustee (other than a
waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment,
order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or any Note Guarantee, or
to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any sterlingdenominated restriction herein, the Sterling Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a
non-sterling currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
non-sterling amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Listing**

The Initial Notes have been listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to
trading on the Euro MTF Market thereof. Application will be made to list the New Notes on the Official List of
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to admit the New Notes to trading on the Euro MTF Market thereof. There
is no assurance that any application to list the New Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
and to admit the New Notes to trading on the Euro MTF Market would be approved and settlement of the New
Notes is not conditioned on obtaining such listing.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since the majority of the assets of DGHL and its Subsidiaries are located outside the United States, any
judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer, DGHL or any non-U.S. Guarantor, including
judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any
redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Notes, may not be collectable within the United
States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the
Notes, the Issuer and the Guarantors have in the Indenture irrevocably submitted to the jurisdiction of the federal

270


-----

and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of New York, United
States. The Indenture provides that the Issuer and each Guarantor, will appoint Drax Biomass Inc., The Villages
on Tower, 2571 Tower Drive Monroe, LA 71201 USA, as their agent for service of process in any suit, action or
proceeding with respect to such Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees brought in any U.S. federal or New
York state court located in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Notes, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder, are governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. The Intercreditor Agreement and the rights and
duties of the parties thereunder are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and

Net Leverage at such date to (y) the aggregate amount of Consolidated EBITDA for the period of the two most

guarantees, repays, repurchases, redeems, defeases or otherwise discharges any Indebtedness (other than ordinary
working capital borrowings) subsequent to the commencement of the period for which the Consolidated Net
Leverage Ratio is being calculated and on or prior to the date on which the event for which the calculation of the

will be calculated giving pro forma effect (as determined in good faith by an Officer of DGHL responsible for
accounting or financial reporting) to such Incurrence, assumption, guarantee, repayment, repurchase, redemption,
defeasance or other discharge of Indebtedness, and the use of the proceeds therefrom, as if the same had occurred

reduction synergies that have occurred.

including increases in ownership of Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries, during the
reference period or subsequent to such reference period and on or prior to the Calculation Date, or
that are to be made on the Calculation Date, will be given pro forma effect (as determined in good
faith by an Officer of DGHL responsible for accounting or financial reporting and may include
anticipated expense and cost reduction synergies) as if they had occurred on the first day of the
reference period;

(2) the Consolidated EBITDA (whether positive or negative) attributable to discontinued operations, as
determined in accordance with IFRS, and operations, businesses or group of assets constituting a
business or operating unit (and ownership interests therein) disposed of prior to the Calculation Date

obligations of DGHL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries following the Calculation Date;

(4) any Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed to have been a
Restricted Subsidiary at all times during such reference period;

(5) any Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed not to have
been a Restricted Subsidiary at any time during such reference period; and

(6) if any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest, the interest expense on such Indebtedness will be
calculated as if the rate in effect on the Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire
period (taking into account any Interest Rate Agreement applicable to such Indebtedness), and if any
Indebtedness is not denominated in DGHL’s functional currency, that Indebtedness for purposes of
the calculation of Consolidated Net Leverage shall be treated in accordance with IFRS.

“Contingent Obligations” means, with respect to any Person, any obligation of such Person guaranteeing

therefor;

expense on such Indebtedness will be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Calculation Date had
been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Interest Rate Agreement

Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complies with the foregoing conditions.

The Board of Directors of DGHL may designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary;
_provided that immediately after giving effect to such designation (a) no Default or Event of Default would result_

**BOOK-ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The New Notes sold pursuant to Rule 144A under the US Securities Act will initially be represented by one
or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Rule 144A Global Notes”). The
New Notes sold to non-US persons outside the United States in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S
(“Regulation S”) under the US Securities Act (the “Regulation S New Notes”) will initially be represented by
one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes”
and, together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The Global Notes will be deposited, on the
Issue Date, with The Bank of New York Mellon, as custodian for DTC and registered in the name of Cede & Co.,
as DTC’s nominee.

The New Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S will initially be issued bearing a temporary ISIN and CUSIP
that differ from the ISIN and CUSIP of the Initial Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S (the “Regulation S Initial
**Notes”), and will initially trade separately from the Regulation S Initial Notes. The consolidation date for the**
Regulation S New Notes will be 40 days after the later of (i) the Issue Date and (ii) the date on which the New
Notes were first offered to persons other than distributors as defined in Regulation S. See “The Offering” and
_“Description of Notes”._

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (“Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests”) and in the
Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the Rule 144A BookEntry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with DTC or persons
that hold interests through such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Regulation S
Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on
the books of their respective depositaries. Except under the limited circumstances described below, Book-Entry
Interests will not be held in definitive certificated form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be done only through, records maintained
in book-entry form by DTC and its participants. The Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be issued only
in denominations of $200,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The laws of some
jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take
physical delivery of such securities in definitive certificated form. The foregoing limitations may impair your
ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the New Notes are in global form,
holders of Book-Entry Interests will not have the New Notes registered in their name, will not have received
physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or “holders”
of New Notes for any purpose (other than for certain tax purposes).

So long as the Notes are held in global form, DTC, or its nominee, will be considered the sole holder of the
Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. Accordingly, participants must rely on the procedures of DTC,
and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of DTC and the participants through which they own BookEntry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders under the Indenture.

None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent and the Paying Agent, or any of their
respective agents will have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records relating to the BookEntry Interests.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount
received by them in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection
with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by DTC, Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The
Issuer understands that, under the existing practices of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the
New Notes are to be redeemed at any time, DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective
participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions), by lot or on such other
basis as they deem fair and appropriate in accordance with their operational procedures; provided, however, that
no Book-Entry Interest of less than $200,000 principal amount may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

The Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal,
premium, if any, and interest and Additional Amounts, if any) to the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent will in turn

303


-----

distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their customary procedures. The Issuer expects that
standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of BookEntry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer and the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent and the
Paying Agent will treat the registered holder of the Global Notes (i.e., the custodian for DTC or its nominee) as
the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes.

Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent and the Paying Agent or any
of its or their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

   - any aspect of the records of DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining, supervising or
reviewing the records of DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating
to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

   - DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant; or

   - the records of the common depositary.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global
Notes will be paid in US dollars.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken
by a holder of Notes (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described above) only at the direction
of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only
in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants
has or have given such direction. DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting
of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event
of default under the Notes, each of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right to exchange the Global
Notes for definitive registered Notes in certificated form (“Definitive Registered Notes”), and to distribute
Definitive Registered Notes to its participants.

**Transfers**

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Notes described herein, transfers
between participants in DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with DTC’s, Euroclear’s
and Clearstream’s rules, as applicable, and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder of the Notes
requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in
jurisdictions which require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder of the
Notes must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of DTC and in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture.

The Global Notes will have a legend to the effect set forth under “Notice to Investors”. Book-Entry Interests
in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements discussed under
“Notice to Investors”.

Transfers of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A Book-Entry
Interests will at all times be subject to such transfer restrictions.

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule
144A or any other exemption (if available under the US Securities Act).

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Rule
144A Book-Entry Interest denominated in the same currency only upon delivery by the transferor of a written
certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who
the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a
transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions
described under “Notice to Investors” and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any state of the
United States or any other jurisdiction.

304


-----

Transfers involving exchanges of beneficial interests between the Regulation S Global Notes and the
Rule 144A Global Notes will be effected by DTC by means of an instruction originated by the Trustee and the
Registrar or the relevant Transfer Agent, as applicable, through the DTC “deposit/withdrawal at custodian”
system. Accordingly, in connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest
for a Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal
amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A
Global Note. Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes
delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a BookEntry Interest in the first-mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note,
and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to
Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive Registered
Notes only if:

   - DTC notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary or has ceased to be a
clearing agency registered under the US Exchange Act and, in either case, a successor depositary is not
appointed by the Issuer within 120 days; or

   - the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such an exchange in writing delivered to DTC following an
event of default under the Indenture.

In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may
transfer such Definitive Registered Note by surrendering it to the Registrar or the Transfer Agent. In the event of
a partial transfer or a partial redemption of a holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one
Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of the
part transferred and a new Definitive Registered Note in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred or
redeemed will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable; provided that a Definitive Registered Note
will only be issued in denominations of $200,000 or in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.

The Issuer will not be required to register the transfer or exchange of Definitive Registered Notes for a
period of 15 calendar days preceding (i) the record date for any payment of interest on the Notes, (ii) any date
fixed for redemption of the Notes; or (iii) the date fixed for selection of the Notes to be redeemed in part. Also,
the Issuer is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Notes selected for redemption or which the
holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a change of control offer or asset sale
offer. In the event of the transfer of any Definitive Registered Note, the Trustee may require a holder, among
other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents as described in the Indenture. The
Issuer may require a holder to pay any transfer taxes and fees required by law and permitted by the Indenture and
the Notes.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such a Definitive Registered Note
has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Note is mutilated and is
surrendered to the Registrar or at the office of the Transfer Agent, the Issuer will issue, and the Trustee will
authenticate, a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and the Issuer’s requirements are met.
The Issuer or the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish
an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee and the Issuer to protect the Issuer, the Trustee
or the Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a
Definitive Registered Note is replaced. The Issuer may charge for any expenses incurred by us in replacing a
Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to
become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Issuer pursuant to the provisions of the
Indenture, the Issuer, in its discretion, may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or
purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests only in accordance
with the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certification (in
the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions
applicable to such Notes. See “Notice to Investors”.

So long as the Notes are admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market and listed on the Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, we will publish a

305


-----

notice of any issuance of Definitive Registered Notes in a newspaper having general circulation in Luxembourg
(which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort). Payment of principal, any repurchase price, premium and
interest on Definitive Registered Notes will be payable at the office of the Paying Agent in Luxembourg so long
as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange so require.

**Information Concerning DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable. We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for
the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that
settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither us, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent, the
Paying Agent, the Initial Purchasers nor any of our or their respective agents are or will be responsible for those
operations or procedures.

The Issuer understands that DTC is:

   - a limited-purpose trust company organised under New York Banking Law;

   - a “banking organisation” within the meaning of New York Banking Law;

   - a member of the Federal Reserve System;

   - a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code; and

   - a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the US Exchange Act.

DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of
transactions among its participants. It does this through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of
securities participants, eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC participants
include both US and non-US securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and
certain other organisations. DTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation
(“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income
Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated
subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others, such as both US and non-US securities brokers
and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial
relationship with a direct participant either directly or indirectly as indirect participants.

We understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream hold
securities for participating organisations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities
transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such
participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping,
administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities and securities
lending and borrowing. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and
Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks,
trust companies and certain other organisations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to
others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodian relationship
with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to
persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in
respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some
jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the
ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests
through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global
Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System**

DTC has advised the Issuer that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities
such as the Notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of its relevant participants with the
payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe that it will not receive payment on such payment
date. Each relevant participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest

306


-----

in the principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by participants and
indirect participants in DTC to the beneficial owners of the Global Notes will be governed by standing
instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of such participants and indirect participants
and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Paying Agent, or the Transfer Agent, as
applicable, or the Issuer. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee, the Registrar, the Paying Agent or the Transfer
Agent, as applicable, will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of its participants or its indirect participants in
identifying the beneficial owners of the Notes, and the Issuer and the Trustee may conclusively rely on and will
be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee or all purposes. Subject to the transfer
restrictions set forth under “Notice to Investors”, transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in
accordance with DTC’s procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds, and transfers between participants in
Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures.

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions set forth under “Notice to Investors” cross-market
transfers of Book-Entry Interests in the Notes between the participants in DTC, on the one hand, and Euroclear or
Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be done through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf
of each of Euroclear or Clearstream by its common depositary; however, such cross-market transactions will
require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream by the counterparty in such system in accordance
with the rules and regulations and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or
Clearstream will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to the common
depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving Book-Entry Interests by
DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement
application to DTC. Euroclear and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the common
depositary.

Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant
purchasing an interest in a Note from a participant in DTC will be credited, and any such crediting will be
reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream participant, during the securities settlement processing day
(which must be a business day for Euroclear and Clearstream) immediately following the settlement date of
DTC. Cash received in Euroclear and Clearstream as a result of a sale of an interest in a Note by or through a
Euroclear or Clearstream participant to a participant in DTC will be received with value on the settlement date of
DTC but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as at the business day for
Euroclear or Clearstream following DTC’s settlement date.

Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream are expected to follow the foregoing procedures in order to
facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as the
case may be, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such
procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. The Issuer, the Trustee, the Initial Purchasers, the
Registrar, the Transfer Agent and any paying agents for the Notes and their respective agents will have no
responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect
participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the New Notes will be made in US dollars. Book-Entry Interests owned through
Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in
registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value on the
settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and DTC and will
settle in same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the
time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to
ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

**Certain United Kingdom Tax Considerations**

_The comments below, which are of a general nature and are based on the Issuer’s understanding of current_
_UK law and H.M. Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”) published practice (which may not be binding on HMRC),_
_both of which may be subject to change, possibly with retrospective effect, describe only the UK (i) withholding_
_tax treatment of payments in respect of the Notes and the Guarantees, and (ii) stamp duty and SDRT treatment of_
_the issue and transfer of the Notes. They are not exhaustive. They do not deal with any other UK taxation_
_implications of acquiring, holding, exchanging, redeeming or disposing of the Notes or the Guarantees._
_Prospective holders of the Notes who are in any doubt as to their tax position or who may be subject to tax in a_
_jurisdiction other than the UK are strongly advised to consult their own professional advisers._

**United Kingdom Withholding Tax**

So long as the Notes are and continue to be admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market and are admitted to
the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (which is a “recognised stock exchange” for the purposes of
section 1005 of the ITA), payment of interest on the Notes may be made without withholding or deduction for or
on account of UK income tax.

Interest on the Notes may also be paid without withholding or deduction for or on account of UK income tax
where at the time the payment is made, the Issuer (and any person by or through whom interest on the Notes is
paid) reasonably believes that (a) the person beneficially entitled to the interest is a UK resident company or a
non-UK resident company that carries on a trade in the UK through a permanent establishment and the payment
is one that the non-UK resident company is required to bring into account when calculating its profits subject to
UK corporation tax, or (b) the person to whom the payment is made is one of the further classes of bodies or
persons, and meets any relevant conditions, set out in sections 935-937 of the ITA, provided in each case HMRC
has not given a direction, the effect of which is that the payment may not be made without that withholding or
deduction.

In other cases, absent any other relief or exemption (such as a direction by HMRC that interest may be paid
without withholding or deduction for or on account of UK income tax to a specified holder of the Notes
following an application by that holder of the Notes under an applicable double tax treaty), an amount must
generally be withheld on account of UK income tax at the basic rate (currently 20 per cent.) from payments of
interest on the Notes.

Where the Notes are issued on terms that a premium is or may be payable on redemption, as opposed to
being issued at a discount, then it is possible that any such element of premium may constitute a payment of
interest and be subject to withholding on account of UK income tax as outlined in the preceding paragraphs.

Where the Notes are issued at an issue price of less than 100 per cent. of their principal amount, any
payments in respect of the accrued discount element on any such Notes will not be made subject to any
withholding or deduction for or on account of UK income tax.

Where interest has been paid under deduction of UK income tax, holders of the Notes who are not resident
in the UK may be able to recover all or part of the tax deducted under an appropriate provision of an applicable
double taxation treaty.

The references to “interest” above are to “interest” as understood for the purposes of UK tax law. They do
not take into account any different definition of “interest” that may prevail under any other tax law or that may
apply under the terms and conditions of the Notes or any related document.

**Payments by a Guarantor**

If payments by a Guarantor under the Guarantee were not treated as having a UK source they should not be
subject to UK withholding tax. If this were not the case then, depending on the correct legal analysis of the
payments as a matter of UK tax law (which is uncertain), it is possible that any payments by a Guarantor would
be subject to UK withholding tax at the basic rate (currently 20 per cent.), subject to any claim which could be
made under applicable double tax treaties or any other available exemption and reliefs, including an exemption
for certain payments to which a company within the charge to UK corporation tax is beneficially entitled.

**Information Reporting**

Information relating to securities (including in relation to interest or payments treated as interest and
payments derived from securities) may be required to be provided to HMRC in certain circumstances. This may

308


-----

include the value of the Notes, details of the holders or beneficial owners of the Notes (or the persons for whom
the Notes are held), details of the persons to whom payments derived from the Notes are or may be paid and
information in connection with transactions relating to the Notes. Information may be required to be provided by,
among others, the holders of the Notes, persons by (or via) whom payments derived from the Notes are made or
who receive (or would be entitled to receive) such payments, persons who effect or are a party to transactions
relating to the Notes on behalf of others and certain registrars or administrators.

In certain circumstances, the information obtained by HMRC may be provided to tax authorities in other
countries.

**UK Stamp Duty and SDRT**

No UK stamp duty or SDRT is payable on the issue, or on a transfer (or agreement to transfer), of the Notes.

**Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following is a discussion of material US federal income tax considerations relevant to the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the New Notes issued pursuant to this offering, but does not purport to be a
complete analysis of all potential tax effects. The discussion is limited to considerations relevant to a US Holder
(as defined below), except to the extent discussed in “—Foreign Account Tax Compliance”, and does not address
the effects of other US federal tax laws, such as estate and gift tax laws, or any state, local or foreign tax laws.
This discussion is based on the US Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury
regulations promulgated thereunder (“Treasury Regulations”), judicial decisions, and published rulings and
administrative pronouncements of the US Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), in each case in effect as of the
date hereof. These authorities may change or be subject to differing interpretations. Any such change or differing
interpretation may be applied retroactively in a manner that could adversely affect a holder of the New Notes.
We have not sought and will not seek any rulings from the IRS regarding the matters discussed below. There can
be no assurance the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position to that discussed below regarding the tax
consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the New Notes.

This discussion is limited to holders who hold the New Notes as “capital assets” within the meaning of
Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). In addition, this discussion is limited to
persons purchasing the Notes for cash pursuant to this Offering Memorandum and at the offering price on the
cover page. This discussion does not address all US federal income tax consequences relevant to a holder’s
particular circumstances, including the impact of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income. In
addition, it does not address consequences relevant to holders subject to special rules, including, without
limitation:

   - US expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;

   - persons liable for the alternative minimum tax;

   - US Holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the US dollar;

   - persons holding the New Notes as part of a hedge, straddle or other risk reduction strategy or as part of a
conversion transaction or other integrated investment;

   - banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions;

   - real estate investment trusts and regulated investment companies;

   - brokers, dealers and traders in securities;

   - “controlled foreign corporations”, “passive foreign investment companies” and corporations that
accumulate earnings to avoid US federal income tax;

   - US partnerships or other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for US federal income tax
purposes (and investors therein);

   - tax-exempt organisations and governmental organisations;

   - persons deemed to sell the New Notes under the constructive sale provisions of the Code; and

   - persons required to recognise any item of gross income for US federal income tax purposes with respect
to the New Notes no later than when such item is taken into account on an applicable financial statement.

   - persons required to recognise any item of gross income for US federal income tax purposes with respect
to the Notes no later than when such item is taken into account on an applicable financial statement.

309


-----

For purposes of this discussion, a “US Holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that, for US federal income
tax purposes, is:

       - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

       - a corporation, or an entity treated as a corporation for US federal income tax purposes, created or
organised under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia;

       - an estate, the income of which is subject to US federal income tax regardless of its source; or

       - a trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a US court and the control of one or more
“United States persons” (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code), or (2) has a
valid election in effect to be treated as a United States person for US federal income tax purposes.

If an entity or arrangement taxed as a partnership for US federal income tax purposes holds the New Notes,
the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will depend on the status of the partner, the activities of the
partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, partnerships holding the New
Notes and the partners in such partnerships should consult their tax advisers regarding the US federal income tax
consequences to them.

THIS DISCUSSION IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE.
INVESTORS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISERS WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICATION OF
THE US FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS TO THEIR PARTICULAR SITUATIONS AS WELL AS ANY
TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF THE NEW NOTES
ARISING UNDER OTHER US FEDERAL TAX LAWS (INCLUDING ESTATE AND GIFT TAX LAWS),
UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-US TAXING JURISDICTION OR UNDER ANY
APPLICABLE TAX TREATY.

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, we expect the issuance of the New Notes to be treated as a “qualified
reopening” of the Initial Notes and therefore as part of the same issuance as the Initial Notes. If so treated, the
New Notes will have the same issue date and the same issue price as the Initial Notes. The remainder of this
discussion assumes that the issuance of the New Notes will be treated as a qualified reopening of the 2022 Notes.

**_Pre-Issuance Accrued Interest_**

A portion of the purchase price of the New Notes is attributable to the amount of unpaid stated interest
accrued prior to the date that the New Notes are issued (the “pre-issuance accrued interest”). A portion of the first
stated interest payment on the New Notes equal to any pre-issuance accrued interest will be treated as a return of
a portion of the purchase price paid for such New Notes and will not be taxable as interest on the New Notes.
Amounts treated as a return of pre-issuance accrued interest should not be taxable when received and should not
be included in a U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its New Note. The remainder of this discussion assumes that
the New Notes will be so treated, and all references to the stated interest in the remainder of this discussion
excludes pre-issuance and accrued interest.

**_Characterisation of the New Notes_**

Under certain circumstances, the New Notes provide for payments in excess of stated interest and principal
and/or redemption prior to their stated maturity. The Issuer intends to take the position that these provisions will
not cause the New Notes to be subject to the contingent payment debt instrument rules of applicable Treasury
Regulations (the “CPDI Rules”). This position is based in part on assumptions regarding the likelihood, as of the
issue date, that such additional amounts will have to be paid. The Issuer’s position is binding on a US Holder,
unless the US Holder discloses in the proper manner to the IRS that it is taking a different position. The Issuer’s
position is not, however, binding on the IRS. If the IRS successfully challenged the Issuer’s position, the tax
consequences of owning and disposing of the New Notes could be materially different than those described
herein, including with respect to the character, timing and amount of income, gain or loss recognised. In addition,
if either the Initial Notes or the New Notes are contingent payment debt instruments, the New Notes will
generally not constitute a qualified reopening of the Initial Notes and thus may not be fungible with the Initial
Notes. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the New Notes are not subject to the CPDI Rules, but there
can be no assurances in this regard. US Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisers regarding the
potential application to the New Notes of the CPDI Rules and the consequences thereof.

**_Payments of Stated Interest_**

Payments of stated interest on a New Note (including any additional amounts paid in respect of withholding
taxes and without reduction for any amounts withheld) generally will be includible in the gross income of a US

310


-----

Holder as ordinary income at the time that such payments are received or accrued, in accordance with such US
Holder’s method of accounting for US federal income tax purposes.

**_Foreign Tax Credit_**

Stated interest income on a New Note generally will constitute foreign source income and generally will be
considered “passive category income” in computing the foreign tax credit allowable to US Holders under US
federal income tax laws. There are significant complex limitations on a US Holder’s ability to claim foreign tax
credits (or deduction in lieu thereof). US Holders should consult their own tax advisers regarding the creditability
or deductibility of any foreign taxes withheld.

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of the New Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a New Note, a US Holder
generally will recognise US source gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realised upon
such disposition (less any amount attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as such
to the extent not previously included in income as described above under “—Payments of stated interest”) and
such US Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the New Note.

The amount realised by a US Holder is the sum of the cash plus the fair market value of all other property
received on the sale or other taxable disposition. A US Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a New Note will generally
be its cost for the New Note, reduced by a portion attributable to pre-issuance accrued interest received by such
U.S. Holder with respect to such New Note.

Gain or loss a US Holder recognises on the sale or other taxable disposition of the New Notes generally will
be US source capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if a US Holder
has held the New Notes for more than one year. For non-corporate US Holders, long-term capital gains are
generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. A US
Holder should consult its own tax adviser regarding the deductibility of capital losses in its particular
circumstances.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of interest on the New Notes and to
the proceeds of the sale or other disposition (including a redemption or retirement) of a New Note paid to a US
Holder, unless such US Holder is an exempt recipient and, when required, provides evidence of such exemption.
A US Holder that is not an exempt recipient may be subject to US federal backup withholding at the applicable
rate (currently 24 per cent.) with respect to payments on the New Notes and the proceeds of a sale or other
taxable disposition of the New Notes, unless the US Holder provides its taxpayer identification number to the
paying agent and certifies on IRS Form W-9, under penalties of perjury, that it is not subject to backup
withholding and otherwise complies with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. Backup
withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding withheld from a payment to a US
Holder may be allowed as a credit against such US Holder’s US federal income tax liability and may entitle such
US Holder to a refund, provided the required information is furnished to the IRS in a timely manner.

**_Additional Notes_**

The Issuer may issue Additional Notes, as described under “Description of Notes”. These Additional Notes,
even if they are treated for non-tax purposes as part of the same series as the original Notes, in some cases may
be treated as a separate series for US federal income tax purposes. In such case, the Additional Notes may be
considered to have been issued with original issue discount, which may adversely affect the market value of the
original Notes if the Additional Notes are not otherwise distinguishable from the original Notes.

**_Tax return disclosure requirements_**

Individuals (and certain entities) that own “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value in
excess of certain thresholds generally are required to file an information report with respect to such assets with
their tax returns. The New Notes generally will constitute specified foreign financial assets subject to these
reporting requirements, unless the New Notes are held in an account at certain financial institutions. US Holders
are urged to consult their tax advisers regarding the application of the foregoing disclosure requirements to their
ownership of the New Notes, including the significant penalties for non-compliance.

311


-----

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance_**

Pursuant to certain provisions of the Code, commonly known as FATCA, a “foreign financial institution”
may be required to withhold on certain payments it makes (“foreign passthru payments”) to persons that fail to
meet certain certification, reporting, or related requirements. The Issuer may be a foreign financial institution for
these purposes. A number of jurisdictions (including the jurisdiction of the Issuer) have entered into, or have
agreed in substance to, intergovernmental agreements with the United States to implement FATCA (“IGAs”),
which modify the way in which FATCA applies in their jurisdictions. Under the provisions of IGAs as currently
in effect, a foreign financial institution in an IGA jurisdiction would generally not be required to withhold under
FATCA or an IGA from payments that it makes. Certain aspects of the application of the FATCA provisions and
IGAs to instruments such as the New Notes, including whether withholding would ever be required pursuant to
FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments on instruments such as the New Notes, are uncertain and may be
subject to change. Even if withholding would be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to
payments on instruments such as the New Notes, such withholding would not apply prior to the date that is two
years after the date on which final regulations defining “foreign passthru payments” are published in the US
Federal Register and the New Notes are issued on or prior to the date that is 6 months after the date of such
publication generally would be “grandfathered” for purposes of FATCA withholding unless materially modified
after such date (including by reason of a substitution of the Issuer). However, if Additional Notes that are not
distinguishable from the previously issued New Notes are issued after the expiration of the grandfathering period
and are subject to withholding under FATCA, then withholding agents may treat all New Notes, including the
New Notes offered prior to the expiration of the grandfathering period, as subject to withholding under FATCA.
Holders should consult their own tax advisers regarding how these rules may apply to their investment in the
New Notes. In the event any withholding would be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to
payments on the New Notes, no person will be required to pay additional amounts as a result of the withholding.

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

**General**

ERISA imposes certain requirements on “employee benefit plans” (as defined in Section 3(3) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”)) subject to Title I of ERISA and on
entities whose underlying assets are considered to include “plan assets”, within the meaning of 29 C.F.R.
Section 2510.3-101 (as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA) (“ERISA Plans”), and on those persons who are
fiduciaries with respect to ERISA Plans. Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA’s general fiduciary
requirements, including, but not limited to, the requirement of investment prudence and diversification and the
requirement that an ERISA Plan’s investments be made in accordance with the documents and instruments
governing the plan.

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an
ERISA Plan (as well as those plans that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section 4975 of the
Code, such as individual retirement accounts (together with ERISA Plans, “Plans”)) and certain persons (referred
to as “parties in interest”, within the meaning of Section 3(14) of ERISA, or “disqualified persons”, within the
meaning of Section 4975 of the Code) having certain relationships to such Plans, unless a statutory or
administrative exemption is applicable to the transaction. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages
in a prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and/or
the Code.

Any Plan fiduciary which proposes to cause a Plan to purchase the Notes should consult with its counsel
regarding the applicability of the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and
Section 4975 of the Code to such an investment, and to confirm that such purchase and holding will not
constitute or result in a prohibited transaction or any other violation of an applicable requirement of ERISA.

Non-US plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32)
of ERISA) and certain “church plans” (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA or Section 4975(g)(3) of the Code),
while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of
ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to non-US, state, local, federal or other laws,
rules or regulations that are substantially similar to the foregoing provisions of ERISA and the Code
(collectively, “Similar Law”). Fiduciaries of any such plans should consult with their counsel before purchasing
the Notes to determine the need for, and the availability, if necessary, of any exempted relief under any such law
or regulations.

Each ERISA Plan should consider the fact that none of Issuer, Initial Purchasers, Guarantors, Paying Agent,
Transfer Agent and their respective affiliates (the “Transaction Parties”) is acting, or will act, as a fiduciary to
any ERISA Plan with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. The Transaction Parties are not
undertaking to provide impartial investment advice or advice based on any particular investment need, or to give
advice in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. All communications,
correspondence and materials from the Transaction Parties with respect to the Notes are intended to be general in
nature and are not directed at any specific purchaser of the Notes, and do not constitute advice regarding the
advisability of investment in the Notes for any specific purchaser. The decision to purchase and hold the Notes
must be made solely by each prospective ERISA Plan purchaser on an arm’s length basis. The Transaction
Parties have a financial interest in an ERISA Plan’s purchase and holding of the Notes, which interests may
conflict with the interest of such ERISA Plan, as more fully described in this Offering Memorandum.

**_Prohibited Transaction Exemptions_**

The fiduciary of a Plan that proposes to purchase and hold any Notes should consider, among other things,
whether such purchase and holding may involve (i) the direct or indirect extension of credit to a party in interest
or a disqualified person, (ii) the sale or exchange of any property between a Plan and a party in interest or a
disqualified person, or (iii) the transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of, a party in interest or disqualified person,
of any Plan assets. Such parties in interest or disqualified persons could include, without limitation, the Issuer,
the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent or any of their respective affiliates. Depending on the
satisfaction of certain conditions, which may include the identification of the Plan fiduciary making the decision
to acquire and/or hold the Notes on behalf of a Plan, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of
the Code or Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption (“PTCE”) 84-14 (relating to transactions effected by an
“independent qualified professional asset manager”), PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance company
pooled separate accounts), PTCE 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment funds),
PTCE 95-60 (relating to investments by insurance company general accounts) or PTCE 96-23 (relating to

313


-----

transactions directed by an in-house asset manager) (collectively, the “Class Exemptions”) could provide an
exemption from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. However, there
can be no assurance that any of these Class Exemptions or any other exemption will be available with respect to
any particular transaction involving the Notes.

Each Plan fiduciary (and each fiduciary for non-US, governmental or church plans subject to Similar Law)
should consult with its legal adviser concerning the potential consequences to the Plan under ERISA, the Code or
such Similar Laws of an investment in the Notes, or that, if any of the PTCEs or another exemption or exception
is available, it will cover all aspects of any particular transaction.

**_Representation and Warranty_**

By its purchase of any Note, the purchaser and any subsequent transferee thereof will be deemed to have
represented and warranted that either: (i) it is not a Plan and no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or
transferee to acquire and hold the Notes constitutes assets of any Plan or non-US, governmental or church plan
subject to Similar Law or any entity whose underlying assets are considered to include “plan assets” (within the
meaning of Section 2510.3-101 of Title 29 of the United States Code of Federal Regulations, as modified by
Section 3(42) of ERISA) of any such plan, account or arrangement, or (ii) (A) the purchase and holding of the
Notes by such purchaser or transferee does not and will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation under any applicable Similar Law and (B) none
of the Transaction Parties or any other party to the transactions contemplated by this Offering Memorandum or
any of their respective affiliates is acting, or will act, as a fiduciary to any Plan with respect to the decision to
purchase or hold the notes or is undertaking to provide impartial investment advice or give advice in a fiduciary
capacity with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the notes.

**The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive. Due to the**
**complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in prohibited**
**transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering whether to**
**purchase the Notes offered hereby on behalf of or with the assets of, any Plan or non-US, governmental or**
**church plan subject to Similar Law, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of**
**ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such transaction and whether an exemption**
**would be applicable to such transaction. Investors in the Notes offered hereby have exclusive responsibility**
**for ensuring that their purchase of the Notes does not violate the fiduciary or prohibited transaction rules**
**of ERISA or the Code or any similar provisions of Similar Laws. The sale of any Notes offered hereby by**
**or to any Plan is in no respect a representation by us or any of our affiliates or representatives that such an**
**investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by such Plans generally, or**
**any particular Plan, or that such an investment is appropriate for such Plans generally or any particular**
**Plan.**

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

The Initial Purchasers are Merrill Lynch International, Barclays Capital Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC,
Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, HSBC Bank plc and NatWest Markets Securities Inc. The Issuer has agreed
to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase from us, pursuant to a purchase
agreement between the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Initial Purchasers (the “Purchase Agreement”), the entire
principal amount of the New Notes.

The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to
purchase New Notes from us, are several and not joint.

**General**

The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the New Notes for resale at the issue price that appears on
the cover of this Offering Memorandum. The Initial Purchasers may change the prices at which the New Notes
are offered and any other selling terms at any time without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell New
Notes through certain of their affiliates, who are qualified broker-dealers under applicable law, including in
respect of sales into the United States.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept
delivery of the New Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by their
counsel and our counsel.

The Purchase Agreement provides that we will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against
certain liabilities, including liabilities under the US Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial
Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof.

**No Sale of Similar Securities**

The Purchase Agreement provides that we will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against
certain liabilities, including liabilities under the US Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial
Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. We have agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions as
provided under the Purchase Agreement, that during the period from the date hereof through and including the
date that is 60 days after the date the New Notes are issued, not to, and to cause our subsidiaries not to, without
having received the prior written consent provided for in the Purchase Agreement, offer, sell, contract to sell or
otherwise dispose of any debt securities issued or guaranteed by us or any of our subsidiaries.

**Securities Not Being Registered Under the US Securities Act**

The New Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the US Securities Act
and may not be offered or sold within the United States except to “qualified institutional buyers” (as defined in
Rule 144A under the US Securities Act) in reliance on Rule 144A under the US Securities Act (“Rule 144A”)
and outside the United States to non-US persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the
US Securities Act (“Regulation S”). Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by
Regulation S. Resales of the New Notes are restricted as described under “Notice to Investors.”. Each purchaser
of the New Notes will be deemed to have made the acknowledgements, representations, warranties and
agreements as described under “Notice to Investors”.

**United Kingdom**

This Offering Memorandum is for distribution only to persons who (i) have professional experience in
matters relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000
(Financial Promotion) Order 2005, as amended (the “Financial Promotion Order”), (ii) are persons falling

Each of the Initial Purchasers has represented, warranted and agreed that:

   - it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of
section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any New Notes in
circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or any Guarantor; and

   - it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done
by it in relation to any New Notes in, from or otherwise involving the UK.

**MIFID II Product Governance/Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market**

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in
respect of the New Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the New Notes is eligible
counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”);
and (ii) all channels for distribution of the New Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are
appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the New Notes (a “distributor”) should
take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is
responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the New Notes (by either adopting or
refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**PRIIPs Regulation / Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors**

The New Notes are not intended to be offered or sold to and should not be offered or sold to any retail
investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is
one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the
meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client
as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus
Directive. No key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the New Notes
or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared. Offering or selling the New
Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs
Regulation. This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of New Notes in any
Member State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Directive from the
requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of New Notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for
the purposes of the Prospectus Directive.

**Other Jurisdictions**

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of New Notes in any Member
State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Directive from the requirement to
publish a prospectus for offers of New Notes. The expression “Prospectus Directive” means Directive
2003/71/EC (as amended or superseded), and includes any relevant implementing measure in the Member State
concerned.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the UK, by us or the Initial
Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the New Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of
this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the New Notes in any jurisdiction where action
for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the New Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and
neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the New
Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any
applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not
constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or
solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to
inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the offering of the New Notes, the distribution
of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the New Notes. See “Notice to Investors”.

**Resale Restriction**

The Issuer and the Guarantors have also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell,
pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer,
sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the US Securities
Act or the safe harbours of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the New
Notes.

**New Issue of Securities**

The Initial Notes have been listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for
trading on the Euro MTF Market. We will apply, through our Listing Agent, to list the New Notes on the Official
List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to have the New Notes admitted for trading on the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange’s Euro MTF.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the New Notes as permitted by
applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the New Notes, and any
market- making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without
notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the US Securities
Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“US Exchange Act”).

Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the New Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it
does develop or that you will be able to sell any New Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be
favourable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and Our Capital Structure—
_Holders of the Notes may not be able to resell the Notes easily, an active liquid trading market for the Notes may_
_not develop or may be volatile and no assurance can be made regarding the prices at which holders of the Notes_
_might be able to resell the Notes”._

**Short Positions**

In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers may purchase and sell the New Notes in the open
market. These transactions may include short sales and purchases on the open market to cover positions created
by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the Initial Purchasers of a greater principal amount of New Notes
than they are required to purchase in the Offering. The Initial Purchasers must close out any short position by
purchasing New Notes in the open market. A short position is more likely to be created if the Initial Purchasers
are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the New Notes in the open market after
pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the Offering.

Similar to other purchase transactions, the Initial Purchasers’ purchases to cover the syndicate short sales
may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the New Notes or preventing a decline in the
market price of the New Notes. As a result, the price of the New Notes may be higher than the price that might
otherwise exist in the open market.

Neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or
magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the New Notes. In
addition, neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation that the Initial Purchasers will
engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.

**Initial Settlement**

We expect that delivery of the New Notes will be made against payment on the New Notes on or about the
date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be business days (as such term
is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the US Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the New Notes (this
settlement cycle is being referred to as “T + ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the US Exchange Act, trades in the
secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade
expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the New Notes on the date of this Offering
Memorandum or during the following business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement
cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the New Notes who wish to make
such trades should consult their own advisers.

**Other Relationships**

The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities,
which may include securities trading, commercial investment banking, financial advising, investment
management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial Purchasers or their
respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past and may provide in the future investment
banking, commercial purpose lending, treasury management, corporate broker, transaction and clearing services,
consulting and financial advisory services to us and our affiliates in the ordinary course of business for which
they may receive customary advisory and transaction fees and expense reimbursement. In addition, in the
ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad

317


-----

array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial
instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such
investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer, the Guarantors or
their respective affiliates. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may receive allocations of the New Notes. In
connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers are not acting for anyone other than the Issuer. In addition,
certain of the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are lenders under (i) the 2018 Bridge Facility (and as a result
will receive a portion of the proceeds of the Offering) and (ii) the Revolving Facility. Moreover, the Initial
Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates are or may, in the future, act as hedge counterparties to certain of our
hedging arrangements consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial
Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either
the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities, including potentially the New
Notes. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of New Notes. The Initial Purchasers
and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research
views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they
acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND**
**ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND SECURITY**

The following is a brief description of certain limitations on the validity and enforceability of the
Guarantees and security interests for the New Notes and of certain aspects of insolvency law in each of the
jurisdictions in which the Issuer, the Guarantors and the providers of security in respect of the New Notes are
organised. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the providers of security in respect of
the New Notes or any other of the Issuer’s subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to know
with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or
the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations of
the Issuer, the Guarantors and the providers of security to the New Notes. The descriptions below are only a
summary and do not purport to be complete or discuss all of the limitations or considerations that may affect the
New Notes, the Guarantees or other security interests.

**European Union**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are organised under the laws of member states of the EU
(“Member States”).

Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on insolvency
proceedings (recast) (the “Recast EU Insolvency Regulation”) is applicable to insolvency proceedings within
the EU (other than Denmark and other than in respect of certain insurance, credit institution and investment
undertakings) opened from 26 June 2017 onwards. The Recast EU Insolvency Regulation replaces Council
Regulation (EC) no. 1346/2000 (the “Insolvency Regulation”), which continues to apply to insolvency
proceedings opened prior to 26 June 2017. Under the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the
Member State (other than Denmark) in which a company’s “centre of main interests” (as that term is used in
Article 3(1) of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation) (“COMI”) is located have jurisdiction to open “main
insolvency proceedings” (discussed further below). The determination of where the Issuer, any of its subsidiaries
or a Guarantor has its COMI is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have
differing and even conflicting views. Under Article 4 of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, a court that is
requested to open insolvency proceedings will first examine whether it believes it has jurisdiction under
Article 3.

Article 3(1) of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation states that COMI “shall be the place where the debtor
_conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is therefore ascertainable by third_
_parties”. Further, Article 3(1) of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation provides that “in the case of a company or_
_legal person, the place of the registered office shall be presumed to be the centre of its main interests in the_
_absence of proof to the contrary”. This gives rise to a rebuttable presumption that a company has its COMI in the_
Member State in which it has its registered office, in the absence of proof to the contrary. That presumption only
applies if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the three-month period prior
to the request to open insolvency proceedings. Pursuant to Preamble 30 of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation,
it may be possible to rebut this presumption where the company’s central administration is located in a Member
State other than that of its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors
establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual centre of management
and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. In the event of a
shift in the COMI to another State, this may require informing the creditors of the new location from which the
debtor is carrying out its activities in due course (e.g. by drawing attention to the change of address in
commercial correspondence or otherwise making the new location public through other appropriate means).

The courts, in cases concerning the previous Insolvency Regulation, have taken into consideration a number
of factors in deciding whether the presumption as to COMI should be rebutted, including: (a) where board
meetings are held; (b) the location where the company conducts the majority of its business or has its head office;
and (c) where it has its central administration. The courts consider objective factors that are ascertainable by third
parties. A company’s COMI may change from time to time. However, for the purposes of deciding which courts
have competent jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings, it is considered at the time that the application
to open the insolvency proceedings is filed.

The Recast EU Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings that are collective insolvency
proceedings of the types referred to in Annex A to the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation.

Main insolvency proceedings may be commenced in the jurisdiction where the company has its COMI. A
court in that jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in

319


-----

Annex A to the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, with these proceedings being governed by the insolvency laws
of the jurisdiction where the court opening main insolvency proceedings is located. Main insolvency proceedings
opened in one Member State under the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognised in the other
Member States (other than Denmark). However, secondary proceedings may be opened in another Member State
(see further below).

If the COMI of a debtor is in one Member State (other than Denmark) under Article 3(2) of the Recast EU
Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open
territorial proceedings in respect of the debtor if it has an “establishment” in the territory of such other Member
State (referred to as “territorial insolvency proceedings”). An “establishment” is defined in Article 2(10) of the
Recast EU Insolvency Regulation as “any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in
_the 3 month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity_
_with human means and assets”. The effect of those secondary proceedings is restricted to the assets of the debtor_
situated in the territory of that Member State.

Where main proceedings have been opened in the Member State in which the company has its COMI, any
territorial insolvency proceedings later opened in another Member State in which the company has an
establishment are referred to as “secondary insolvency proceedings” (within the meaning of Article 3(3) of the
Recast EU Insolvency Regulation).

Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the company has its COMI have not yet been
opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can only be opened in another Member State, where the company has
an establishment, where either: (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the Member State in which the
company’s COMI is located because of the conditions laid down by the law of the Member State within the
territory of which the centre of the debtor’s main interests is located; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings
are opened at the request of either (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of
an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is
requested, or (ii) a public authority which, under the law of the Member State within the territory of which the
establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. Irrespective of whether
the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, the proceedings will, subject to
certain exemptions, be governed by the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction.

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognise the judgment of the court opening
main proceedings and, subject to any exceptions provided for in the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, that
judgment will be given the same effect in the other Member States (so long as no secondary proceedings have
been opened there). The insolvency officeholder appointed by a court in a Member State that has jurisdiction to
open main proceedings (because the company’s COMI is there) may exercise the powers conferred on him by the
law of that Member State in another Member State (e.g. removing assets of the company from that other Member
State), subject to certain limitations. This will be the case so long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened
in that other Member State or any preservation measure has been taken further to a request to open insolvency
proceedings in that other Member State where the company has assets.

Article 36 of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation provides a right to the insolvency practitioner under the
main proceedings to give an undertaking in order to avoid the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings
elsewhere. That insolvency practitioner may give a unilateral undertaking to local creditors in respect of the
assets located in that Member State. The undertaking would state that that when distributing those assets or the
proceeds received as a result of their realisation, the insolvency practitioner will comply with the distribution and
priority rights under national law that creditors would have if secondary insolvency proceedings were opened in
that Member State. This undertaking must be approved by the known local creditors. If approved, the
undertaking is binding on the estate and a court will refuse to open secondary insolvency proceedings if the
protection of the general interests of the local creditors under the undertaking is sufficient.

The Recast EU Insolvency Regulation also provides for rules to co-ordinate main and secondary
proceedings (Articles 41 onwards), as well as to coordinate cross-border group insolvencies within the EU
(Articles 56 onwards). In the event that insolvency proceedings concerning two or more members of a group of
companies are opened, insolvency practitioners and courts shall co-operate and communicate with any other
insolvency practitioner and any other court involved in insolvency proceedings of another member of the group
(Articles 56 and 57). In addition, an insolvency practitioner appointed in insolvency proceedings opened in
relation to a member of the group may request group co-ordination proceedings before any court having
jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of any member of that group. Any request would be accompanied by
a proposal as to who the group coordinator would be (Article 61).

320


-----

In the event that the Issuer or any Guarantor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with
certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings will be commenced, or the
outcome of proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer
and the Guarantors. The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdictions in which the respective
companies are organised or operate may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and there is no
assurance as to how the insolvency laws of the potentially involved jurisdictions will be applied in relation to one
another.

It is not possible to know what impact the vote by the United Kingdom to leave the EU will have on the
application of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation to any insolvency to which the Issuer or any Guarantor may
be subject, as this will depend upon the nature of any arrangement reached between the United Kingdom and the
EU. See “—England and Wales” for further discussion in this regard.

**United Kingdom**

The English Guarantors (together with the Issuer, the “English Obligors”) are companies incorporated
under the laws of England and Wales. The Scottish Guarantor is a company incorporated under the laws of
Scotland. Therefore, any main insolvency proceedings with respect to an English Obligor would likely be
commenced in England or, in the case of the Scottish Guarantor, Scotland.

However, pursuant to the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation (as detailed above), where an English or
Scottish company conducts business in another Member State of the EU, the jurisdiction of the English or
Scottish courts may be limited if the company’s COMI is found to be in another Member State (see “—European
Union”). The place of the registered office of a company is presumed to be the COMI, in the absence of proof to
the contrary. That presumption only applies if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State
within the three-month period prior to the request to open insolvency proceedings. The point at which this issue
falls to be determined is at the time that the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened. Similarly, the UK
Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006, which implement the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border
Insolvency in the UK, provide that a foreign (i.e., non-EU) court may have jurisdiction where any English or
Scottish company has its COMI in such foreign jurisdiction or where it has an “establishment” (being a place of
operations in such foreign jurisdiction, where it carries out non-transitory economic activities with human means
and assets or services) in such foreign jurisdiction.

English and Scottish insolvency law may not be as favourable to investors’ interests as the laws of the
United States or other jurisdictions with which investors are familiar. In the event that an English Obligor or
Scottish Guarantor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of
insolvency or similar proceedings. The obligations under the New Notes are secured by security interests over the
Collateral. English and Scottish insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of a
Guarantee against an English Obligor or a Scottish Guarantor and the enforceability of security interests over the
Collateral.

**England and Wales**

**_Insolvency Proceedings_**

As a general rule, insolvency proceedings with respect to an English company should be commenced in
England based on English insolvency laws, although (as noted above) insolvency proceedings in respect of
English companies could also be based in other jurisdictions under certain circumstances.

Under the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, secondary proceedings may be commenced against an English
Obligor in Member States (except Denmark) other than the United Kingdom even if the COMI is in England,
provided that the company has an establishment within the territory of that other Member State. The effects of
these proceedings would be restricted to the assets of such English Obligor situated in that Member State (see
“—European Union”).

Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways,
including by an English Obligor’s directors or a creditor making an application for administration, in or (in the
case of such English Obligor’s directors or any creditors holding security over all or substantially all of such
English Obligor’s assets under a qualifying floating charge) out-of-court, or by a creditor filing a petition to wind
up such English Obligor or such English Obligor’s shareholders resolving to do so (in the case of liquidation). A
company may be wound up if it is unable to pay its debts, and may be placed into administration if it is, or is
likely to become, unable to pay its debts, and the administration is reasonably likely to achieve one of three
statutory purposes (see “—Administration and floating charges”).

321


-----

Under the UK Insolvency Act 1986, as amended (the “Insolvency Act”), a company is insolvent if it is
unable to pay its debts. A company is deemed unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis
(unable to pay its debts as they fall due), which test can be demonstrated, for example, where a company fails to
satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 or if it fails to satisfy in full a judgment debt (or
similar court order), or if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is less than
the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities).

**_Fixed and Floating Charges_**

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has an advantage over floating charge security,
including (a) an administrator appointed to a charging company can convert floating charge assets to cash and
use such cash, or use cash subject to a floating charge, to meet administration expenses (which can include the
costs of continuing to operate the charging company’s business) while in administration in priority to the claims
of the floating charge holder; (b) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have
priority as against the floating charge over the charged assets; (c) general costs and expenses (including the
remuneration of the insolvency officeholder(s)) properly incurred in a winding-up are payable out of the
company’s assets (including the assets that are the subject of the floating charge) in priority to floating charge
claims (the same does not apply to fixed charge assets); (d) until the floating charge security crystallises, a
company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of
business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give a third
party good title to the assets free of the floating charge and meaning that there is a risk of security being granted
over such assets in priority to the floating charge security; (e) floating charge security is subject to certain
challenges under English insolvency law (see “—Challenges to guarantees and security—Grant of floating
_charge”); (f) floating charge security is subject to the claims of preferential creditors (such as occupational_
pension scheme contributions and salaries and/or holiday owed to employees) and to ring-fencing (see
“Administration and floating charges”); and (g) an administrator may dispose of or take action relating to
property subject to a floating charge without the prior consent of the charge holder or court but the floating
charge holder retains the same priority in respect of the proceeds from the disposal of the assets subject to the
floating charge. With prior approval of the court, an administrator may deal with property subject to a fixed
charge provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the administration’s purpose and that the
administrator apply the net proceeds from the disposal of the property in question towards discharging the
obligations of the company to the charge holder.

Under English law, there is a possibility that a court could recharacterise fixed security interests purported
to be created by a security document as floating charges, and the description given to security interests by the
parties is not determinative. Whether security interests labelled as fixed will be upheld as fixed security interests
rather than floating security interests will depend on, among other things, whether the chargee has the requisite
degree of control over the relevant chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if
so, whether such control is exercised by the charge in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the secured
assets without the consent of the chargee prior to crystallisation, the court is likely to hold that the security
interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge in the
security documents.

**_Administration and Floating Charges_**

The relevant English insolvency statutes empower English courts to make an administration order in respect
of an English company in certain circumstances. An administration order can be made if the court is satisfied that
the relevant company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” and that the administration order is
reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. An administrator can also be appointed out of court
by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge, and different procedures apply
according to the identity of the appointor. The purpose of an administration is comprised of three objectives that
must be looked at successively: rescuing a company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable,
achieving a better result for a company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely if a company went into
immediate liquidation or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable, and the interests of the creditors
as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realising property to make a distribution to secured or
preferential creditors. An administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business and, subject to certain
requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration (including
property subject to a floating charge).

In general, during the administration, no proceedings or other legal process may be commenced or
continued against the debtor or security enforced over the company’s property, except with leave of the court or

322


-----

the consent of the administrator. Certain creditors of a company in administration may be able to realise their
security over that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the
disapplication of the moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral agreement” (generally, cash or
financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments) under the Financial
Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003. If an English Obligor were to enter administration, it is
possible that, to the extent that it is not a financial collateral arrangement, the security granted by it or the
guarantee granted by it may not be enforced while it is in administration, without the leave of the court or
consent of the administrator. In addition, other than in limited circumstances, no administrative receiver can be
appointed by a secured creditor in preference to an administrator, and any already appointed receiver must resign
if requested to do so by the administrator. Where the company is already in administration, no receiver may be
appointed.

In order to empower the Security Agent to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator to the
company, the floating charge granted by the relevant English Obligor must constitute a “qualifying floating
charge” for purposes of English insolvency law and, in the case of the ability to appoint an administrative
receiver, the qualifying floating charge must, unless the security document pre-dates 15 September 2003, fall
within one of the exceptions in the Insolvency Act to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative
receivers. In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument
which (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it; (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint
an administrator of the company; or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver
within the meaning given by section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act. The Security Agent will be the holder of a
qualifying floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with the fixed charge security
interests, relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the relevant English Obligor’s property and at least
one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the
appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to “capital market arrangement” (as defined in
the Insolvency Act), which will apply if the issue of the New Notes creates a debt of at least £50 million for the
relevant company during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital market
investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency Act but is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument).

If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and
not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure)
and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the
security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is invalid. If an administrator is appointed,
any administrative receiver will vacate office. Further, upon the appointment of an administrator, any receiver of
part of the company’s property must resign if required to do so by the administrator.

**_Liquidation_**

Liquidation is a winding-up procedure applicable to companies incorporated under the laws of England and
Wales. There are three ways an English Obligor may be placed into liquidation or “wound up”: (1) Members’
Voluntary Liquidation (which is a procedure available to solvent companies only); (2) Creditors’ Voluntary
Liquidation; and (3) Compulsory Winding-Up.

The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary winding-up.
In a compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act, any disposition of the relevant company’s
property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. Subject to
certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed to have
commenced from the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition. Once a winding-up order is made by the
court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed. No legal action may be continued or
commenced against the company without permission of the court. In the context of a voluntary winding-up
however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a winding-up order; the winding-up commences on
the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act.

On the liquidation of an English company, there is no automatic statutory moratorium in place preventing
the holders of security interests from taking steps to enforce those security interests. Where a company
incorporated under the laws of England and Wales is placed into liquidation, a creditor holding a valid mortgage,
charge or other security interest has four options: (1) to realise the security, apply the proceeds towards discharge
of the secured debt, and prove in the liquidation for any balance; (2) to retain the security and not prove in the
liquidation; (3) to value the security and prove for any shortfall between that value and the value of the debt; or
(4) to surrender the security and prove for the full amount of the debt.

_Priority of claims_

One of the primary functions of liquidation (and, where the company cannot be rescued as a going concern,
one of the possible functions of administration) under English law is to realise the assets of the insolvent
company and to distribute the realisations made from those assets to its creditors. Under the Insolvency Act,
creditors are placed into different classes and, with the exceptions and adjustments noted below, the proceeds
from the realisation of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending order of priority, as set out below.
With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined below), distributions cannot be made to a class of creditors
until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed
otherwise, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts
due to each creditor within a class.

The general priority of claims on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

   - First ranking claims: holders of fixed charge security and creditors with a proprietary interest in specific
assets in the possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor but only to the extent of
the realisations from those secured assets or with respect to the asset in which they have a proprietary
interest;

   - Second ranking claims: expenses of the insolvent estate incurred during the relevant insolvency
proceedings (there is a further statutory order of priority setting out the order in which expenses are paid);

   - Third ranking claims: these are divided into ordinary preferential creditors and secondary preferential
creditors with ordinary preferential creditors being paid in priority to secondary preferential creditors.
Preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to:
(i) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (ii) wages and salaries of employees for work
done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; and
(iii) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes
place before or after the insolvency date. In the Government’s 2018 Autumn Budget it was announced
that, for insolvencies commencing on or after 6 April 2020, taxes collected and held by businesses on
behalf of other taxpayers (including VAT, PAYE income tax, employee national insurance contributions
and construction industry scheme deductions) would constitute secondary preferential debts;

   - Fourth ranking claims: holders of floating charge security to the extent of the realisations from those
secured assets, according to the priority of their security. This would include any floating charge that was
stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which, on a proper interpretation, was
rendered a floating charge. However, before distributing asset realisations to the holders of floating
charges, the Prescribed Part (as defined below) must be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors;

   - Fifth ranking claims: general unsecured creditors:

      - Firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and any secured creditor to the extent of any
unsecured shortfall, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the
date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay the secured creditors any
unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realisations from unsecured assets,
as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part (as defined below)
unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors;

       - secondly, interest on the company’s debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the
official rate) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation, or after the
commencement of any administration which had been converted into a distributing administration.
However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the New Notes or the Guarantees,
such interest due to the holders of the New Notes may, if there are sufficient realisations from the
secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; and

       - thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above
and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid.
This, however, does not include “currency conversion claims” following the English Supreme
Court ruling dated 17 May 2017 on the Lehman Brothers case (see “—Foreign Currency”); and

   - Sixth ranking claims: shareholders. If, after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any
remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company.

Subordinated creditors will be ranked according to the terms of the subordination (provided that such terms
do not contravene the Insolvency Act).

324


-----

_Prescribed part_

An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or liquidator of an English company will be
required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of assets subject to floating charge
security for the benefit of unsecured creditors (the “Prescribed Part”). Under current law, this applies to 50 per
cent. of the first £10,000 of net floating charge realisations and 20 per cent. of the remainder over £10,000, and
the Prescribed Part is subject to a maximum aggregate cap of £600,000. The Prescribed Part must be made
available to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to
creditors. The Prescribed Part will not be available for any shortfall claims of secured creditors unless the
Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors’ claims in full. This requirement shall, however,
not apply to the extent that the floating charge constitutes a financial collateral arrangement under the Finance
Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003.

**_Challenges to Guarantees and Security_**

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of
security and guarantees can be challenged. In most cases, this will only arise if the company is placed into
administration or liquidation within a specified period of the granting of the guarantee or security. Therefore, if
during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed in respect of an English company, the
administrator or liquidator may challenge the validity of the guarantee or security given by such company.

The following potential grounds for challenge may apply to guarantees and charges:

_Transaction at an undervalue_

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company could apply to the court
for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee if such liquidator or administrator
believes that the creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue. There
will only be a transaction at an undervalue if at the time of the transaction or as a result of the transaction, the
English company was or became unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency Act). The transaction can
be challenged if the English company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of two
years from the date the English company grants the security interest or the guarantee. A transaction might be
subject to being set aside as a transaction at an undervalue if the company makes a gift to a person, if the
company receives no consideration or if the company receives consideration of significantly less value, in money
or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company. A court, however, generally will not intervene
if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its
business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit
it. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court can make such order
as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been in if the transaction had not been entered into. In
any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English company was insolvent
unless a beneficiary of the transaction was “connected” with that company, within the meaning of section 249 of
the Insolvency Act (a “Connected Person”), in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the
Connected Person must demonstrate the solvency of the English company in such proceedings.

_Preference_

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company could apply to the court
for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee if such liquidator or administrator
believes that the creation of such security interest or such guarantee constituted a preference. There will only be a
preference if, at the time of the transaction or as a result of the transaction, the English company was or became
unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the English
company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of six months (if the beneficiary of
the security or the guarantee is not a Connected Person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a Connected Person)
from the date the English company grants the security interest or the guarantee. A transaction may constitute a
preference if it has the effect of putting a creditor of the English company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the
company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation)
than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into. A
court is unlikely to make an order in respect of a preference unless it is satisfied the company was influenced in
deciding to give it by a desire to produce the “better position” for the relevant person. If the court determines that
the transaction was a preference, the court has very wide powers for restoring the position to what it would have
been if that preference had not been given, which could include reducing payments under the New Notes and the

325


-----

Guarantees in this instance (although there is protection for a third party who enters into a transaction in good
faith and without notice). In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the
English company was insolvent and that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential
effect, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a Connected Person (other than by reason only of being an
employee of the company), in which case there is a presumption that the company was influenced by a desire to
produce the preferential effect and the Connected Person must demonstrate in such proceedings that there was no
such influence.

The Issuer cannot assure holders of the New Notes that, in the event of insolvency, the granting of the
security or the giving of the Guarantees by companies incorporated under the laws of England and Wales would
not be challenged by a liquidator or administrator or that a court would support our analysis that (in any event)
the security and Guarantees were entered into in good faith for the purposes described above. If a court were to
avoid any grant of security or giving of any Guarantee as a result of a transaction at an undervalue or preference,
or hold it unenforceable for any other reason, investors would cease to have any security over the grantor or a
claim against the Guarantor giving such Guarantee.

_Transaction defrauding creditors_

Under English insolvency law, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue and was made
for the purposes of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a claim against a
company, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim that person is making or
may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors. This provision may
be used by any person who claims to be a “victim” of the transaction (with leave of the court if the company is in
liquidation or administration) and, subject to certain conditions, the UK Financial Conduct Authority and the UK
Pensions Regulator and is not therefore limited to liquidators or administrators. There is no time limit in English
insolvency law within which the challenge must be made (although general statutory limitation periods will
apply) and the relevant company does not need to be unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency Act) or
become unable to pay its debts as a result of the transaction. If the court determines that the transaction was a
transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it
would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the
transaction.

_Extortionate credit transaction_

An administrator or a liquidator can apply for a court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. The
court can review extortionate credit transactions entered into by an English Obligor up to three years before the
day on which the English Obligor entered into administration or went into liquidation. A transaction is
“extortionate” if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the terms of it are (or
were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain
contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly contravened ordinary principles of
fair dealing.

_Grant of floating charge_

Under English insolvency law, if an English Obligor is unable to pay its debts at the time of (or as a result
of) granting a floating charge, and the floating charge was granted within the specified period referred to below,
then such floating charge is invalid except to the extent of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services
supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant English Obligor at the same time as or after
the creation of the floating charge. The requirement for the English Obligor to be insolvent at the time of (or as a
result of) granting the floating charge does not apply where the floating charge was granted within the specified
period referred to below and is granted to a Connected Person. If the floating charge is granted to a Connected
Person, and the floating charge was granted within the specified period referred to below, then the floating charge
is invalid except to the extent of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any
discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant English Obligor at the same time as or after the creation of the
floating charge, whether the relevant English Obligor is solvent or insolvent. The granting of the charge can be
challenged only if the relevant English Obligor enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a
period of one year (if the beneficiary is not a Connected Person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a Connected
Person) from the date the relevant English Obligor grants the floating charge. However, if a floating charge
qualifies as a “security financial collateral agreement” under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2)
Regulations 2003, the floating charge will not be subject to challenge as described in this paragraph. An

326


-----

administrator or a liquidator, as applicable, does not need to apply to court for an order declaring that a floating
charge is invalid. Any floating charge created during the relevant time period is automatically invalid except to
the extent of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of
any debt of, the relevant English company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge (plus
certain interest), whether the relevant English company is solvent or insolvent at the time of grant.

_Limitation on enforcement_

The grant of a guarantee by an English Guarantor in respect of the obligations of another group company
must satisfy certain legal requirements. More specifically, such a transaction must be allowed by the respective
company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that these do not allow such an action, there is
the risk that the grant of the guarantee is found to be void and the beneficiary’s rights in respect of such
guarantee will be unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with an
English Guarantor in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation.
Further, corporate benefit must be established for each English Guarantor in question by virtue of entering into
the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act provides that a director must act in the way that he
considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the English Guarantor for the benefit of
its members as a whole. If a company’s directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient
commercial benefit, they may be found as abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be
vulnerable to being set aside by a court.

_Foreign currency_

Under English insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claim for their debts,
the office-holder will convert all foreign currency denominated proofs of debt into pound sterling at a single rate
for each currency determined by the office-holder by reference to the exchange rates prevailing on the relevant
date. On the next occasion when the office-holder communicates with the creditors, the office-holder must advise
them of any rate so determined. If a creditor considers the rate to be unreasonable, they may apply to the court.

In this context, the English courts have recently determined that “currency conversion claims” do not exist
in law. Such claims made by creditors for loss suffered as a result of the fall in the value of pound sterling
between the date of conversion and the actual date of payment are not part of English law.

_Security over shares_

Security over shares granted by an English Obligor or over shares of an English Obligor are, under English
law, equitable charges, not legal charges. An equitable charge arises where a chargor creates an encumbrance
over the property in favour of the chargee but the chargor retains legal title to the shares. Remedies in relation to
equitable charges may be subject to equitable considerations or are otherwise at the discretion of the court.

_Security over bank accounts_

With respect to any security over bank accounts (each an “Account Charge”) granted by an English
Obligor, the banks with which some of those accounts are held (each an “Account Bank”) may hold a right at
any time (at least prior to them being notified of a crystallisation event under the Account Charge) to exercise the
rights of netting or set-off to which they are entitled under their cash pooling or other arrangements with that
guarantor. As a result, and if the security granted over those accounts is merely a floating (rather than fixed)
charge, the collateral constituted by those bank accounts will be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s rights to
exercise netting and set-off with respect to the bank accounts charged under the relevant Account Charge. Once
the floating charge has crystallised and converted into a fixed charge (as it would on enforcement or the
occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the relevant English Obligor) and the Account Bank has
been formally notified of that fact, the collateral will no longer be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s netting
and set-off rights.

_Schemes of arrangement_

Pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act, the English courts have jurisdiction to sanction a compromise or
arrangement between a company and its creditors (or classes of creditors) where such company (i) is liable to be
wound up under the Insolvency Act; and (ii) has “sufficient connection” to the English jurisdiction.

In practice, in addition to applying to English companies, a foreign company is likely to satisfy the first limb
of this test and the second limb has been found to be satisfied by the English courts where, among other things,

327


-----

the company has assets situated in England, the company’s COMI is in England, the company’s finance
documents are English law governed, or the company’s finance documents have been amended in accordance
with their terms to be governed by English law. The law in this area is being closely considered by the English
courts and the fact that the second limb has been found to be satisfied in such cases previously does not
necessarily mean that this limb will be satisfied in all such cases as each case will be considered on its particular
facts and circumstances.

Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the
proposed compromise or arrangement in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such
creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the
scheme. Such compromise or arrangement can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If a majority in
number representing 75 per cent. or more in value of those creditors present and voting at the creditors’
meeting(s) of each class vote in favour of the proposed compromise, irrespective of the terms and approval
thresholds contained in the finance documents, that compromise will be binding on all affected creditors,
including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote on the scheme of arrangement and those
who voted against the scheme of arrangement. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction
hearing where the court will review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The court
has the discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon
modifications being made to the scheme, or reject the scheme.

**Scotland**

**_Insolvency Proceedings_**

The Insolvency Act is a UK statute and so is also applicable to Scottish companies, although there are some
specific provisions that are only applicable to Scotland or England and Wales. The statements made in the
section “England and Wales—Insolvency Proceedings” above are equally applicable to Scotland and the Scottish
Guarantor, subject to the following sections relating to Scotland.

**_Fixed versus floating charges_**

Fixed charge security has a number of advantages over floating charge security: (a) an administrator
appointed to a charging company can convert floating charge assets to cash and use such cash, or use cash
subject to a floating charge, to meet administration expenses (which can include the costs of continuing to
operate the charging company’s business while in administration) in priority to the claims of the floating charge
holder; (b) a fixed charge over assets, even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as
against the floating charge over the charged assets; (c) general costs and expenses (including the liquidator’s
remuneration) properly incurred in a winding-up are payable out of the floating charge assets to the extent the
assets of the company available for creditors generally are otherwise insufficient to meet them (subject to certain
restrictions for the costs of litigation) in priority to floating charge claims; (d) until the floating charge security
crystallises, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary
course of business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give
a third party good title to the assets free of the floating charge; (e) floating charge security is subject to certain
challenges under Scottish insolvency law (please see”—Grant of Floating Charge” below); and (f) floating
charge security is subject to the claims of preferential creditors (such as occupational pension scheme
contributions and salaries owed to employees (subject to a cap per employee) and holiday pay owed to
employees) and, where the floating charge is not a security financial collateral arrangement, to the claims of
unsecured creditors in respect of a ring-fenced amount of the proceeds (please see “—Administration and floating
_charges” below)._

In Scotland, forms of security are closely tied to specific types of property. Since Scots law does not
recognise the English law concept of “equity” there is more focus on the legal formalities rather than the
intention of the parties with respect to the creation of security interests. If the strict legal requirements under
Scots law are not met, there will be no security over the subject notwithstanding the intention of the parties.

In respect of movable property, it is essential that the security holder has some form of possession (which
may take different forms) over the subject in order to create a valid security interest. Scots law does not
differentiate between legal and equitable ownership of property so, for instance, in order to create a security
interest over shares in companies incorporated in Scotland, the security holder (or its nominee) must be
registered as the shareholder. Furthermore, as there is no Scottish equivalent of an English law equitable
assignment, a Scottish interest in incorporeal property will only be created when the assignation is properly
notified to the relevant parties.

328


-----

Fixed charges over land and buildings situated in Scotland may only be created using a standard security
(which is the Scots law equivalent of a legal mortgage over an interest of land) and is governed by statute.

**_Administration and floating charges_**

Under Scottish insolvency law Scottish courts are empowered to make an administration order in respect of
a Scottish company in certain circumstances. An administrator can also be appointed out of court by the
company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge and different procedures apply according to
the identity of the appointor. During the administration, or after a notice of intention to appoint an administrator
has been lodged, amongst other restrictions, in general no proceedings or other legal process may be commenced
or continued against the company, or security enforced over the company’s property, except with leave of the
court or the consent of the administrator. The moratorium does not, however, apply to a “security financial
collateral arrangement” (such as a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradable
capital market debt instruments) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003. During
the administration of a company, a creditor would not be able to enforce any security interest (other than security
financial collateral agreements) or guarantee granted by it without the consent of the administrator or the court.

In order to empower the Security Agent to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator to the
company, the floating charge granted by the relevant Scottish Guarantor must constitute a “qualifying floating
charge” for purposes of Scottish insolvency law and, in the case of the ability to appoint an administrative
receiver, the qualifying floating charge must, unless the security document pre-dates 15 September 2003, fall
within one of the exceptions in the Enterprise Act 2002 to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative
receivers. In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument
which (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it; (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint
an administrator of the company; (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator receiver; or
(d) purports to empower the holder of a floating charge in Scotland to appoint a receiver who on appointment
would be an administrative receiver (although this is only permitted under limited circumstances). The Security
Agent will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if necessary)
with the fixed charge security interests, relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the relevant Scottish
Guarantor’s property and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge. Whether the assets
that are subject to the floating charge and other security will constitute the whole or substantially the whole of the
relevant Scottish Guarantor’s assets at the time the floating charge is enforced will be a question of fact at that
time. The most relevant exception to the prohibition is that the Security Agent can appoint an administrator
relating to a “capital market arrangement” (as defined in the UK Insolvency Act 1986, as amended), which is the
case if the issue of the note creates a debt of at least £50,000,000 for the relevant company during the life of the
arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital markets investment” (which is defined in the
UK Insolvency Act 1986 as amended, but is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument).

_Prescribed part_

An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or liquidator of a Scottish company will be
required to ring-fence a certain percentage (the Prescribed Part) of the proceeds of enforcement of a floating
charge security granted on or after 15 September 2003 for the benefit of unsecured creditors. Under current law,
this applies to 50 per cent. of the first £10,000 of net floating charge realisations and 20 per cent. of the
remainder over £10,000, and the Prescribed Part is subject to a maximum aggregate cap of £600,000. The
Prescribed Part must be made available to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be
disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors. The Prescribed Part will not be available for any shortfall
claims of secured creditors unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors’ claims in
full. This requirement shall, however, not apply to the extent that the floating charge constitutes a financial
collateral arrangement under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003.

**_Challenges to guarantees and security_**

There are circumstances under Scottish insolvency law in which the granting by a Scottish company of
security and guarantees can be challenged. In most cases this will only arise if the company is placed into
administration or liquidation within a specified period of the granting of the guarantee or security, though
common law challenges can be brought beyond the specified period. If, during the specified period an
administrator or liquidator is appointed to a Scottish company, he may challenge the validity of the guarantee or
security given by such company in certain circumstances.

329


-----

The following potential grounds for challenge may apply to guarantees and security interests:

_Gratuitous Alienations (s.242 Insolvency Act 1986)_

Under Scottish insolvency law, a liquidator, administrator or creditor of a Scottish company could apply to
the court for an order to set aside a security interest or a guarantee granted by the company (or give other relief)
on the grounds that the creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a gratuitous alienation. Under
common law, any alienation (other than in the ordinary course of business or in implementation of prior
obligations) by an insolvent debtor which confers a benefit on a creditor and prevents a fair division of the
insolvent estate among creditors is reducible at the instance of present and future creditors. The transaction can
be challenged if the Scottish company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of
two years from the date the Scottish company grants the security interest or the guarantee or five years in the case
of an alienation to a “connected person” of the Scottish company. A transaction might be subject to being set
aside as a gratuitous alienation (the English equivalent is a transaction at undervalue) if the company makes a gift
to a person (save in certain specified circumstances), or if the company receives no consideration or if the
company receives inadequate consideration. However a gratuitous alienation action may be defeated if the person
seeking to uphold the alienation establishes (i) that immediately or at any other time or after the alienation the
company’s assets were greater than its liabilities; (ii) the alienation was made for adequate consideration; or
(iii) the alienation was a birthday, Christmas or other gift for a charitable purpose to a person not an associate of
the company, which having regard to all circumstances it was reasonable for the company (without prejudice to
any right or interest acquired in good faith and for value from the recipient of the alienation) to make. If the court
determines that the transaction was a gratuitous alienation the court can grant a decree of reduction or for
restoration of the property or assets or such other redress as may be appropriate (although there is protection for a
third party who acquires in good faith and for value any right or interest through the transferee in the alienation).

A transaction made at a time when a company is insolvent may also constitute a gratuitous alienation at
common law. In these circumstances, no time limits apply in relation to challenging it. A gratuitous alienation
may constitute wrongful (or indeed fraudulent) trading, or a breach of duty, and lead to action being raised
against directors personally.

_Unfair Preferences (s.243 Insolvency Act 1986)_

Under Scottish insolvency law, a liquidator, administrator or creditor of a Scottish company could apply to
the court for an order to set aside a security interest or a guarantee (or give other relief) on the grounds that the
security interest or such guarantee constituted an unfair preference. Under common law, an unfair preference
(other than in the ordinary course of business or in implementation of prior obligations) by an insolvent debtor
which prejudices the general body of creditors is reducible at the instance of present and future creditors. The
transaction can be challenged if the Scottish company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings
within a period of six months from the date the Scottish company grants the security interest or the guarantee. A
transaction may constitute an unfair preference if it has the effect of putting a creditor of the Scottish company
(or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the
company going into insolvent liquidation) than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in
had that transaction not been entered into. If the court determines that the transaction was an unfair preference,
the court may grant a decree of reduction or restoration of the property or assets or such other redress as may be
appropriate (although there is protection for a third party who acquires in good faith and for value any right or
interest from or through the creditor in whose favour the preference was created). An unfair preference may also
be challenged at common law and no time limits apply. An unfair preference may also constitute wrongful (or
indeed fraudulent) trading or a breach of duty and lead to actions being raised against directors personally.

The following will not constitute unfair preferences:

   - transactions in the ordinary course of trade or business;

_Extortionate Credit Transactions (s.244 Insolvency Act 1986)_

A liquidator, administrator or creditor of a Scottish company could apply to the court for an order to set
aside a security interest or guarantee granted by the company on the grounds that the credit transaction is
“extortionate”. The transaction must have been entered into within three years prior to the administration or
liquidation and must have involved the provision of credit to the company on a basis which, having regard to the
risk accepted by the person providing the credit, requires grossly exorbitant payments to be made or otherwise
grossly contravenes the ordinary principles of fair dealing.

_Grant of Floating Charge (s.245 Insolvency Act 1986)_

Under Scottish insolvency law, a floating charge granted by the Scottish Guarantor is invalid except to the
extent of the aggregate of (1) the consideration for the creation of the floating charge consisting of money paid or
goods or services supplied to the Scottish Guarantor at the time of the creation of the floating charge, (2) the
value of the consideration consisting of the discharge or reduction of any debt of the Scottish Guarantor at the
same time as or after the creation of the floating charge and (3) the amount of any interest payable on these sums,
if the Scottish Guarantor enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a statutory challenge period.
The statutory challenge period is a period of one year (if the beneficiary is not a connected person) or two years
(if the beneficiary is a connected person) from the date the Scottish Guarantor grants the floating charge.
However, if the beneficiary is not a connected person, no amount of the floating charge will be invalid unless the
Scottish Guarantor is unable to pay its debts as they fall due (as defined by s.123 Insolvency Act 1986) or
becomes unable to so pay its debts as a consequence of granting the floating charge, This ability to challenge
does not, however, apply to any charge created or otherwise arising under a “security financial collateral
arrangement” under the Financial Collateral (No. 2) Regulations 2003.

**_Guarantees_**

A pure guarantee is an accessory obligation by a guarantor relating to the primary obligation of the party
whose obligations are guaranteed. If the primary obligation is altered, discharged or fails, the guarantee may not
be enforceable. However, the document containing the guarantee will almost invariably contain an indemnity, i.e.
a direct obligation from the guarantor to the third party as an independent primary obligation. The indemnity
should survive even if the guarantee is unenforceable in the circumstances described above. No limitation
language is required to be included in the Indentures relating to the Note Guarantee by the Scottish Guarantor.

Corporate benefit must be established if a company is granting a guarantee. If there is doubt about whether
there is corporate benefit, shareholders’ approval for the act should be obtained although the act could still be
challenged by other parties such as creditors. In addition, if no corporate benefit is established and a liquidator or
administrator is appointed to the company, the transaction is more susceptible to an attack by the liquidator or an
administrator as an “unfair preference” or a “gratuitous alienation” and may be rendered unenforceable.
However, it is possible to establish defences against such attacks (see the defences set out in “—Scotland—
_Challenges to guarantees and security—Gratuitous Alienations”. Such defences are normally considered at the_
time of the board meeting of the company granting the guarantee. The company might seek to document its
solvency position, for example, by having an accountant prepare updated accounts.

**_Directors’ Authority_**

If no corporate benefit is established, it may not be possible to enforce a guarantee or security interest
granted where the directors of the company giving the guarantee or security interest exceeded their authority.
Directors will exceed their authority if a transaction is beyond the objects or powers in the company’s articles of
association (constitution). A third party dealing in good faith with a company can still enforce the transaction.
However, a third party will not be acting in good faith if it knows the transaction is beyond the power of the
directors and is not for the benefit of the company (e.g. a guarantee or security interest has no corporate benefit
for the company but benefits the directors or another person). In a transaction of this nature it is therefore market
practice for the legal advisers to confirm that there are no such restrictions in the articles of association.

**_Disclaimer of Contracts_**

A liquidator appointed to the Scottish Guarantor would have the right to adopt contracts entered into by the
Scottish Guarantor or to repudiate them. If the liquidator does not adopt a contract within a reasonable time, he
will be deemed to have repudiated the contract. This rule does not apply to market contracts with a recognised
investment exchange or recognised drawing house nor to any financial collateral arrangement under the Financial
Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003.

**United States**

**_Fraudulent Transfer_**

Under the US Bankruptcy Code or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or fraudulent
conveyance laws, the transfer of an interest in property or the incurrence of an obligation, including the
incurrence of the obligations under the New Notes, the issuance of the Guarantees and the grant of security,
whether now or in the future, by the Issuer and the Guarantors (together, the “Obligors”) could be avoided (both
as to the initial recipient and any subsequent transferees), if, among other things, at the time the Obligors made
such transfer or incurred such obligation, any Obligor (i) intended to hinder, delay or defraud any present or
future creditor, or (ii) received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the transfer or
obligation and:

   - was insolvent on the date the transfer was made or obligation incurred or were rendered insolvent by the
transfer or incurrence of the obligation;

   - was engaged in a business or transaction or about to be engaged in a business or transaction for which the
Obligor’s remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital; or

   - intended to incur, or believed that they would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they
mature.

In determining whether an Obligor was “insolvent” on the date the transfer was made, there can be no
assurances as to what standard a court would apply in order to determine insolvency. Generally, an Obligor
would be considered insolvent at a particular time if the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was at
such time greater than the fair saleable value of all of its assets, if the present fair saleable value of its assets were
at such time less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts,
including contingent liabilities, as they became absolute and matured or if it could not pay its debts as they
became due. There can be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in order to determine whether an
Obligor was “insolvent” after giving effect to a particular transfer of interest in property or the occurrence of an
obligation or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that an Obligor was
“insolvent” upon giving effect to such transfer or incurrence of an obligation.

**_Preference_**

Any future grant of security interest with regard to the Collateral in favour of, or other payment or transfer
with respect to, the New Notes, including pursuant to security documents delivered after the date of the
Indenture, might be avoidable (both as to the initial recipient and any subsequent transferees) in a US bankruptcy
case by the grantor (as debtor-in-possession) or by its bankruptcy trustee as a preference if certain events or
circumstances exist or occur (subject to exceptions), including, among others, the grantor is insolvent at the time
of the grant, a bankruptcy case in respect of the grantor is commenced within 90 days following the grant (or in
certain circumstances, a longer period) and the security interest grant or other payment or transfer permits the
holders of the New Notes to receive a greater recovery than if the bankruptcy case were a case under chapter 7 of
the US Bankruptcy Code and the security grant or other transfer or payment had not been made.

**_Other Actions_**

As a court of equity, a US bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the New Notes or other
claims against us under the principle of equitable subordination, if the US bankruptcy court determines that:
(i) the holder of New Notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct; (ii) such inequitable conduct resulted
in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holder of New Notes; and (iii) equitable
subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the US Bankruptcy Code.

**_The Automatic Stay_**

The right of a holder of the New Notes to enforce its security interests against the Obligors upon the
occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture governing the New Notes is likely to be significantly
impaired by applicable US bankruptcy law if one or more of the Obligors becomes a debtor in a case under the
US Bankruptcy Code. Upon the commencement of a case under the US Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor,
such as a holder of New Notes, is prohibited by the automatic stay imposed by the US Bankruptcy Code from
commencing or continuing any act to obtain possession of or exercise control over property of the bankruptcy
estate, including any Collateral. The automatic stay in a bankruptcy case of one or more of the Obligors could
therefore prevent the holders of the New Notes from obtaining possession or exercising control over the

332


-----

Collateral or commencing any action in an attempt to obtain possession or exercise control over the Collateral.
The automatic stay could be lifted or modified with bankruptcy court approval in certain circumstances, but
parties may object to any creditor’s request to lift or modify the automatic stay, and the bankruptcy court may
deny such a request.

**_Right of Debtor-in-Possession to Remain in Control of Collateral and the Bankruptcy process_**

An entity that becomes a debtor under chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code remains in possession of its
property and is authorised to operate and manage its business as a “debtor-in-possession”, subject to certain
limitations. This remains the case unless a chapter 11 trustee is appointed or the chapter 11 case is converted to a
chapter 7 liquidation under the US Bankruptcy Code, in which case a chapter 11 trustee or chapter 7 trustee
remains in possession of the debtor’s property. Moreover, the US Bankruptcy Code permits the debtor to
continue to retain and use collateral even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments,
provided that, upon the secured creditor’s request, the secured creditor is given “adequate protection” of its
interest in the debtor’s property. The term “adequate protection” is not defined in the US Bankruptcy Code, but it
may include making periodic cash payments, providing an additional or replacement lien or granting other relief,
in each case, to the extent that the value of the secured creditor’s interest in such collateral decreases during the
pendency of the bankruptcy case as a result of, among other things, the use, sale or lease of such collateral or the
imposition of the automatic stay. The type of adequate protection provided to a secured creditor may vary
according to circumstances. A US bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor is not entitled to
adequate protection for a decrease in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the amount of
the debt that it secures.

Only the debtor in a chapter 11 bankruptcy case may propose a chapter 11 plan unless the debtor fails to file
a plan within the first 120 days of the case or its plan has not been accepted within the first 180 days of the case
by each class of claims or interests that is impaired under the plan. The bankruptcy court may reduce or enlarge
these periods for cause upon request of a party in interest. The 120-day period could be extended for up to
18 months after a chapter 11 filing, while the 180-day period could be extended for up to 20 months after a
chapter 11 filing. During these “exclusive periods”, other parties, such as secured creditors, would be precluded
from proposing or soliciting acceptances of their own chapter 11 plans.

In view of the automatic stay, the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection”, the
exclusive periods, and the broad discretionary power of a US bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict:

   - whether or when a holder of the New Notes could enforce its security interests;

   - the value of the collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition or at the time a chapter 11 plan is
proposed or confirmed; or

   - whether or to what extent holders of the New Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or
loss of value of the collateral through the requirement of “adequate protection”.

**_A Debtor-in-Possession May Obtain New Credit Secured by a Lien That is Senior or Equal to Existing Liens_**

The US Bankruptcy Code permits a debtor-in-possession or trustee in a chapter 11 case to obtain an
extension of new credit from an existing lender or from a new lender. The bankruptcy court may, depending on
the facts and circumstances, authorise the debtor-in-possession or trustee to obtain new credit or incur new debt
that is secured by a lien that is senior or equal to existing liens, provided that, among other things, there is
adequate protection of the interests of the holders of the existing liens. In other words, it is possible that in
connection with a chapter 11 case of one or more of the Obligors, such Obligor or Obligors would be permitted
to incur new debt that is secured by a lien that is senior or equal to the liens that exist at the time of the chapter 11
filing.

**_Post-Petition Interest_**

Any future bankruptcy trustee, the debtor-in-possession or competing creditors could possibly assert that the
fair market value of the Collateral with respect to the New Notes on the date of the bankruptcy filing was less
than the then-current principal amount of the New Notes. Upon a finding by a bankruptcy court that the New
Notes are under- collateralised, the claims in the bankruptcy proceeding with respect to the New Notes would be
bifurcated between a secured claim and an unsecured claim, and the unsecured claim would not be entitled to the
benefits of security in the Collateral. In the event of a US bankruptcy case, the holders of the New Notes will be
entitled to post-petition interest under the US Bankruptcy Code only if the value of their security interest in the

333


-----

Collateral is greater than their pre-bankruptcy claim. Holders of the New Notes may be deemed to have an
unsecured claim if the obligation under the New Notes equals or exceeds the fair market value of the Collateral
securing the New Notes. Holders of the New Notes that have a security interest in the Collateral with a value
equal to or less than their pre-bankruptcy claim may not be entitled to post-petition interest under the US
Bankruptcy Code.

**_Ability to Confirm a Chapter 11 Plan Notwithstanding the Dissenting Votes of Creditors_**

Under the US Bankruptcy Code, a chapter 11 plan can be imposed on a creditor or equity holder (or class of
creditors or equity holders) that does not accept the plan. A chapter 11 plan provides for the comprehensive
treatment of all claims asserted against the debtor and the property of the bankruptcy estate and may provide for
the readjustment or extinguishment of equity interests. Claims and interests may be classified by type. Only those
classes of claims and interests impaired by the plan may vote to accept or reject such plan. Classes of claims and
interests that are unimpaired are not entitled to vote on the plan and are deemed to accept it. Classes of claims
and interests that receive no distributions under the plan are not entitled to vote on the plan and are deemed to
reject it. A class of claims is deemed to accept the plan if creditors holding at least two- thirds in amount and
more than one-half in number of the claims of such class that vote, vote to accept the plan. A plan can be
confirmed by the bankruptcy court over the dissenting votes of members of a class that accepts the plan overall.
Furthermore, even if one or more impaired classes reject the plan, the plan may still be confirmed, subject to
specific statutory requirements, in accordance with the “cram-down” provisions of the US Bankruptcy Code,
which require, among other things, that one impaired class has accepted the plan and that the plan does not
discriminate unfairly, and is fair and equitable, with respect to each class of claims or interests that is impaired
under, and has not accepted, the plan. This could allow the debtor or other plan proponent to confirm its plan
over the objection of one or more dissenting classes. Such a “cram-down” plan could provide for, among other
things, deferred cash payments, which may extend over a period beyond the maturity of the New Notes, in an
amount equal to the secured portion of the New Notes (as further described above in “Post-petition interest”),
which may bear interest at a rate determined by the bankruptcy court that may be lower than the interest rate
established by the New Notes. Accordingly, such proceedings may result in, among other things, a substantial
reduction in the interest rate and a substantial write down of the principal of the New Notes.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

The Issuer is a company organised under the laws of England and Wales, and certain of the Guarantors of
the New Notes have been incorporated in England and Wales, Scotland and Delaware. The majority of the
directors and executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States. In
addition, the majority of the assets of the Issuer and the non-US Guarantors are located outside the United States.
Although the Issuer and the non-US Guarantors will appoint an agent for service of process in the United States
and will submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York, in each case in connection with any
action under US securities laws, you may not be able to effect service of process on such persons, the Issuer or
the Guarantors within the United States in any action, including actions predicated on civil liability provisions of
the US federal and state securities laws or other laws.

**England and Wales and Scotland**

The following summary with respect to the enforceability of certain US court judgments in England and
Wales and Scotland is based upon advice provided to us by US, English and Scottish legal advisers. The United
States and England and Scotland currently do not have a treaty between them providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters.
Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the US based on civil
liability, whether or not predicated solely upon US federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognised
and/or enforced in England and Wales or in Scotland. In order to enforce any such US judgment in England and
Wales or Scotland, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England and
Wales or Scotland (as applicable). In such an action, an English or Scottish court would not generally
reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the US court (subject to what is said below) and it
would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defence
to it). Recognition and enforcement of a US judgment by an English or Scottish court in such an action is
conditional upon (among other things) the following:

   - the US court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English or Scottish
conflicts of laws principles and rules of English or Scottish private international law;

   - the US judgment not having been given in breach of a jurisdiction or arbitration clause;

   - the US judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the
court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money;

   - the US judgment not contravening English or Scottish public policy or the Human Rights Act 1998;

   - the US judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in
respect of a penalty or fine, or otherwise involving the enforcement of a non-English or non-Scottish
penal or revenue law;

   - the US judgment not being contrary to the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980;

   - the US judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English or Scottish principles of
natural justice;

   - there not having been a prior inconsistent decision of an English or Scottish court in respect of the same
matter involving the same parties; and

   - the English or Scottish enforcement proceedings being commenced within the relevant limitation period.

If an English or Scottish court gives judgment for the sum payable under a US judgment, the English or
Scottish judgment will be enforceable by methods generally available for this purpose. The judgment creditor is
able to utilise any method or methods of enforcement available to him/her at the time. In addition, it may not be
possible to obtain an English or Scottish judgment or to enforce that judgment if the judgment debtor is subject to
any insolvency or similar proceedings, or if the judgment debtor has any set-off or counter-claim against the
judgment creditor.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in England and Wales or Scotland judgments in
civil and commercial matters that have been obtained from US federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure
you that those judgments will be recognised and/or enforced in England and Wales or Scotland. In addition, it is
questionable whether an English or Scottish court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the
original action was commenced in England and Wales or Scotland, instead of the United States, and predicated
solely upon US federal securities laws.

Important points to note include the following:

- claims may become barred under the Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1973 or may be or
become subject to defences of retention, compensation, set-off or counter claim;

- in proceedings in the Scottish courts, matters of US law or any other system of law other than Scots law
affecting the rights and duties of the parties under the documents which are governed by US law or any
other system of law other than Scots law would be required to be established as a matter of evidence and
in the absence of such establishment the Scottish courts would apply Scots law;

- while the Scottish courts will uphold the choice of US law to govern the documents stipulated to be
governed by US Law, they will not give effect to any provision of such documents which, though valid
under US law, are considered by the Scottish courts to be contrary to public policy in Scotland or if the
choice of law purports to avoid mandatory rules of another country, such as one with which the
transaction is wholly connected; and

- insolvency proceedings in respect of the Scottish Guarantor would generally be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Session (where the “centre of main interests” of the Scottish Guarantor is
situated in the United Kingdom), though territorial proceedings might be raised against the Scottish
Guarantor in respect of assets in another jurisdiction.

We are independent of the Group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit
of the financial statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council’s (the ‘FRC’s’) Ethical Standard as applied to listed
public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We confirm
that the non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the parent company.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

SUMMARY OF OUR AUDIT APPROACH


Key audit
matters


The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:

- Presentation of the Consolidated income statement

- Valuation of commodity and foreign exchange contracts

- Estimation of retail unbilled revenue

- Accounting for the acquisition of Drax Generation Enterprise Limited (Scottish Power assets)

Within this report, any new key audit matters are identified with and any key audit matters which are the same as the
prior year identified with .


Materiality The materiality that we used for the Group financial statements was £7.6m (2017: £6.8m). This was determined taking
into consideration a number of metrics, but with particular focus on Earnings before Interest, Taxation, Depreciation
and Amortisation (Adjusted EBITDA) which excludes the impact of exceptional items and certain remeasurements,
as this measure is of direct relevance to readers of the financial statements. Our selected materiality represents
approximately 3.0% of Adjusted EBITDA for the year (2017: 2.9% of Adjusted EBITDA).

Scoping We focused our Group audit scope primarily on the audit work at five locations, being Drax Power, Haven Power, Opus
Energy, Drax Biomass and Drax Generation Enterprise Limited. These were subject to a full scope audit, other than Drax
Biomass and Drax Generation Enterprise Limited which were subject to specific audit procedures to support our Group
audit opinion. These five locations represent the principal business units and account for virtually all of the Group’s net
assets, revenue and profit before tax.

SUMMARY OF OUR AUDIT APPROACH CONTINUED


Significant
changes
in our
approach


The following changes were made to the key audit matters reported in the prior year:

- We have included as a key audit matter the presentation of the Consolidated income statement covering both
exceptional items and certain remeasurements;

- We have also included the accounting for the acquisition of Drax Generation Enterprise Limited as a new acquisition
in the year; and

- The risk of impairment at Drax Power is no longer a key audit matter given the levels of headroom in both the previous
and current year.

In the current year, our Group audit scope was extended to include Drax Generation Enterprise Limited following its
acquisition by the Group on 31 December 2018.

Other aspects of our audit approach remain broadly consistent with the prior year.


CONCLUSIONS RELATING TO GOING CONCERN, PRINCIPAL RISKS AND VIABILITY STATEMENT

Going concern
We have reviewed the directors’ statement on page 42-43 to the financial statements concerning whether they
considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements
and their identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s and company’s ability to continue to do so
over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements.

We considered as part of our risk assessment the nature of the Group, its business model and related risks
including where relevant the impact of Brexit, the requirements of the applicable financial reporting framework
and the system of internal control. We evaluated the directors’ assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as
a going concern, including challenging the underlying data and key assumptions used to make the assessment,
and evaluated the directors’ plans for future actions in relation to their going concern assessment.

We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to that
statement required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) and report if the statement is materially inconsistent with our
knowledge obtained in the audit.

Principal risks and viability statement
Based solely on reading the directors’ statements and considering whether they were consistent with the
knowledge we obtained in the course of the audit, including the knowledge obtained in the evaluation of the
directors’ assessment of the Group’s and the company’s ability to continue as a going concern, we are required
to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to:

- the disclosures on pages 44-49 that describe the principal risks and explain how they are being managed or
mitigated;

- the directors’ confirmation on page 44 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks
facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or
liquidity; or

- the directors’ explanation on page 42 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what
period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to
whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its
liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention
to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.

We are also required to report whether the directors’ statement relating to the prospects of the Group required
by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.


We confirm that
we have nothing
material to
report, add or
draw attention
to in respect of
these matters.

We confirm that
we have nothing
material to
report, add or
draw attention
to in respect of
these matters.


KEY AUDIT MATTERS
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial
statements for the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to
fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy, the allocation of
resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon,
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

We previously identified the risk of asset impairment at Drax Power as a key audit matter reflecting the significant management
judgements involved in assessing impairment and the sensitivity of the level of headroom to reasonable changes in assumptions made.
Given the improvements in revenue arising from both commodity prices and other sources of income, the level of headroom within the
impairment assessment in the prior year, and the established impairment assessment process in place, we no longer consider this to be

## INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF DRAX GROUP PLC continued

PRESENTATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT


Key audit matter
description

How the
scope of our
audit responded
to the key
audit matter


_In the current year, the Group has changed the presentation of its Consolidated income statement set out on page 118_
_of the Annual Report. The Consolidated income statement now segregates Adjusted results from Exceptional items_
_and certain remeasurements (the ‘Middle column’) in arriving at the results for the year. The prior year Consolidated_
_income statement has been restated on a consistent basis. Further detail is disclosed in the Group’s critical accounting_
_judgements, estimates and assumptions set out on pages 114 to 116, note 2.7 Certain remeasurements and exceptional_
_items and the Audit Committee report on pages 69 to 74._

The Adjusted results are a critical measure for stakeholders and underpin the Group’s segmental analysis and
description of business results and therefore the classification of items between Adjusted results and the Middle
column is important for users of the accounts.

The key items included within the Middle column are as follows:

- Remeasurement of certain energy contracts;

- Asset obsolescence charges;

- Acquisition and restructuring costs;

- Debt restructuring costs; and

- Related tax charges and credits.

The Group has established a policy which governs which items are exceptional and should be recognised in the
Middle column. However, judgement is applied in the application of this policy, and whether the above items meet
the definition under the policy to be presented within the Middle column. This is a key area of audit focus for us.

Certain remeasurements comprise unrealised gains or losses on derivative contracts to the extent that those
contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, or hedge accounting is not effective. Such gains and losses are
reclassified into Adjusted results when the related contract leads to a physical sale or purchase. The effect of
excluding certain remeasurements from the Adjusted result is to reflect commodity sales and purchases at
contracted prices in those Adjusted results.

There is a risk that adjusted profit measures are misleading and that the principles used to determine the
classification as exceptional are not in line with relevant guidance, substantiated or applied on a consistent basis.
This also represents a possible fraud risk in relation to the allocation of items to the Middle column.

We assessed the design and implementation of key controls around the presentation of items within either
Adjusted results or the Middle column.

We evaluated the Group’s accounting policy for exceptional items and certain remeasurements against guidance
issued by the FRC and European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) regarding the publication of
transparent, unbiased and comparable financial information.

We considered management’s rationale for the treatment of exceptional items presented, and performed an
independent assessment of the selection and presentation of each item against the Group’s accounting policies
and relevant regulatory guidance. We challenged management over the principles used to determine items as
exceptional, assessing whether the application of the Group’s policy was appropriate and consistent.

For the remeasurement of certain derivative contracts and the recycling of fair value movements to either revenue
or cost of sales on realisation, we reviewed relevant accounting literature in order to determine whether the
approach adopted was appropriate. The accounting standards for this are subject to interpretation and are
currently being reviewed by the International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretation Committee (‘IFRIC’).
However, their draft determination supports the Group’s new presentation of the Consolidated income statement.

We reviewed the presentation and disclosure of management’s conclusions in the Annual Report & Accounts
to assess whether the disclosures are consistent with the Group’s policy and relevant accounting standards.


Key observations We are satisfied that the items presented as exceptional and within certain remeasurements in the Financial
Statements are materially in compliance with the Group’s accounting policies, applicable accounting standards
and guidance, and are clearly described to readers of the Annual Report and Accounts.

We are satisfied that the prior year Consolidated income statement has been represented on a basis consistent
with the new format adopted for 2018.

The majority of acquisition and restructuring costs relate to the Scottish Power acquisition (£21m). However, there
are certain smaller costs incurred in the year which relate to restructuring activities in other areas of the business,
and which have been treated as exceptional items, and presented within the Middle column in the Consolidated
income statement. Whilst the treatment of these costs as exceptional is subjective, the costs incurred are not
material to the Financial Statements.

VALUATION OF COMMODITY AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS


Key audit matter
description

How the
scope of our
audit responded
to the key
audit matter


_Net Gains on derivative contracts recognised in the Consolidated income statement in the year are £38.4m_
_(2017: losses of £176.9m), with related derivative assets of £510.6m and liabilities of £151.4m recognised on the balance_
_sheet as at 31 December 2018. Further detail of the key judgements are disclosed in the Group’s critical accounting_
_judgements, estimates and assumptions set out on pages 114 to 116 and the Audit Committee report on pages 69 to 74._
_Section 7 sets out the financial risk management notes._

The Group has exposure to a number of different financial risks including foreign exchange risk and commodity
risk, and use a variety of derivative contracts to mitigate these risks, including commodity contracts, floating swap
forwards and cross currency swaps.

The valuation of derivative contracts is complex and requires judgement in areas including the selection of
appropriate valuation methodologies, and assumptions in respect of future market prices and credit risk factors.

Due to the large amount of data involved in the contract valuations, and the requirement for certain manual
adjustments, we have identified a fraud risk relating to the potential for management or employees of the
company to value trades inappropriately.

We evaluated the design and implementation and tested the operating effectiveness of key controls related to the
valuation of commodity and foreign exchange contracts.

We used our internal financial instrument specialists to test management’s key judgements and calculations,
including testing a sample of trades undertaken to trade tickets, confirming key contractual terms such as
volumes and contracted prices.

We have assessed the valuation models used by management, including any manual adjustments to determine the
fair value of the derivative instruments and performed independent valuations across a sample of both commodity
and foreign exchange contracts.

We have analysed the appropriateness of management’s forward price curve assumptions by benchmarking these
to third party sources and reviewed the consistency of the assumptions used across other areas of the financial
statements, such as asset impairment.

We have challenged management’s approach and assumptions involved in assessing fair value adjustments such
as credit risk, time value of money and spread adjustments.


Key observations From our testing, we are satisfied that the valuation of commodity and foreign exchange contracts is reasonable.
We consider the valuation models used by management to be appropriate and the forward curve assumptions
adopted are within an acceptable range.

ESTIMATION OF RETAIL UNBILLED REVENUE


Key audit matter
description

How the
scope of our
audit responded
to the key
audit matter


_The recognition of retail revenue requires an estimation of customer usage between the date of the last meter reading_
_and year end, which is known as unbilled revenue. Across the retail division, unbilled revenue at the balance sheet_
_date amounted to £146.5m (2017: £195m) Further detail of the key judgements are disclosed in the Group’s critical_
_accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions set out on pages 114 to 116 and the Audit Committee report_
_on pages 69 to 74. Accrued income is disclosed in note 3.5._

The method of estimating unbilled revenue is complex and judgemental and requires assumptions for both the
volumes of energy consumed by customers and the related value.

We identified a fraud risk in relation to revenue recognition in the retail businesses, in particular to the estimates
underpinning unbilled revenue, as these judgemental areas could be manipulated by management to mis-report
revenue.

We evaluated the design and implementation and tested the operating effectiveness of key controls related to the
estimation of unbilled revenue. This included controls over the reconciliation of meter readings provided by the
energy markets, and which are used by management to estimate the power supplied. We also tested the controls
over the price per unit applied in the valuation of unbilled revenue.

When external market information was not available at the balance sheet date, we obtained and considered
management’s reconciliation of the volume of power purchased to their calculations of revenue supplied and
completed sample tests to check that the December 2018 unbilled revenue amount was subsequently billed.

We also reviewed the aggregate unbilled revenue balance from previous periods to test that the amounts
recognised were subsequently billed in line with the values accrued.


Key observations Our retrospective reviews of estimated revenues found that management have historically achieved a high level
of accuracy. We considered the estimates for revenue earned in the year to be appropriate.

ACCOUNTING FOR THE ACQUISITION OF DRAX GENERATION ENTERPRISE LIMITED


Key audit matter
description

How the
scope of our
audit responded
to the key
audit matter


_On 31 December 2018, the Group acquired Drax Generation Enterprise Limited for £686.9m. In accordance with IFRS 3_
_“Business Combinations”, management has recognised the identifiable assets and the liabilities at their acquisition_
_date fair values. Further detail of the key judgements are disclosed in the Group’s critical accounting judgements,_
_estimates and assumptions set out on pages 114 to 116, the Audit Committee report on pages 69 to 74, and the_
_acquisition note at 5.1._

We have identified a key audit matter in relation to the assumptions applied in respect of the Purchase Price
Allocation (PPA) exercise, identifying in particular judgement related to the fair value of property, plant and
equipment (PP&E), goodwill and any intangible assets arising. Goodwill of £74.8m has been recognised.

We evaluated the design and implementation of key controls related to the acquisition process.

We tested the acquisition balance sheet and initial fair value adjustments of the acquired businesses including
challenging management with regards to the identification and valuation of PP&E, the recognition of intangible
assets and identification of liabilities. This was performed by assessing the adjustments applied to the acquired
assets and liabilities and determining whether these have been appropriately recorded at fair value.

We considered the expertise and approach taken by third party experts engaged by management to perform the
PPA exercise. We evaluated the valuation work undertaken to support the acquisition, and whether contradictory
evidence to the valuations adopted existed. We also used our internal valuation specialists to review the third
party report and identify areas for particular focus in our work.


Key observations Based on the work performed, we are satisfied that the acquired businesses have been appropriately accounted
for in accordance with IFRS 3 “Business Combinations”.

Initial judgements in valuing PP&E in particular have been applied, including in the determination of depreciated
replacement cost values. The disclosures in note 5.1 make clear that the valuation is preliminary and there could be
further amendments as the valuations are finalised, in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 3.

OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our
audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:

Group financial statements Parent company financial statements

Materiality £7.6m (2017: £6.8m) £4.6m (2017: £4.1m)


Basis for
determining
materiality

Rationale for
the benchmark
applied


We have determined materiality by considering a range
of possible benchmarks but with a particular focus on
Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the impact of exceptional
items and certain measurements, together with profit
before and after interest and tax as well as the scale of the
balance sheet and the overall size of the business.

Our selected materiality represents a approximately 3.0% of
Adjusted EBITDA for the year (2017: 2.9% of Adjusted EBITDA)

When determining materiality, we have considered the size
and scale of the business and the nature of its operations.
We have also considered which benchmarks would be of
relevance to the users of the financial statements and
those applied to the audit of similar businesses.

We consider that Adjusted EBITDA is of particular
relevance to users of the financial statements and is a key
measure of performance used by the Group, and excludes
volatility caused in particular by the remeasurements of
derivative contracts.


We have capped materiality at 60% of the
materiality identified for the Group. This is a
judgement and reflects the significant value of
investments held on the balance sheet at the year
end (£717.0m).

When determining materiality, we considered the
net assets of the company as its principal activity
is as an investment holding company for the Group.


We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £0.4m (2017: £0.3m)
for the parent company and Group, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative
grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation i


-----

AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT
Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including group-wide controls, and
assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. Based on that assessment, we focused our group audit scope primarily
on the audit work at five locations, being Drax Power, Haven Power, Opus Energy, Drax Biomass and Drax Generation Enterprise
Limited. These represent the principal business units of the Group and account for virtually all of the Group’s net assets, revenue and
profit before tax. This is in line with 2017, other than Drax Generation Enterprise Limited which is new in the year. A full scope audit was
performed for Drax Power, Haven Power and Opus Energy. For Drax Generation Enterprise Limited and Drax Biomass, specific audit
procedures were performed in order to support the Group audit opinion. This scope was selected to provide an appropriate basis for
undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement identified above. Our audit work at all locations was executed at
levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity which were lower than Group materiality and ranged from £3.0m to £5.3m
(2017: £3.5m to £5.2m).

At the Group level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there
were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject
to audit or audit of specified account balances.

During 2018 the Senior Statutory Auditor visited Drax Power, and other senior team members also visited Drax Generation Enterprise
Limited, Opus Energy and Haven Power. The Senior Statutory Auditor visited Drax Biomass in the US in 2017.

In previous years, a US component team performed the audit of Drax Biomass. In the current year, the Group audit team has performed
this audit, following a restructuring of Drax Biomass resulting in more of the finance function being controlled from the UK.

OTHER INFORMATION


The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included
in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise
explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and,
in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine
whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other
information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this
other information, we are required to report that fact.

In this context, matters that we are specifically required to report to you as uncorrected material misstatements
of the other information include where we conclude that:

- Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the directors on page 104 that they consider the annual
report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy, is
materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or

- Audit committee reporting – the section describing the work of the audit committee on pages 69 to 74 does not
appropriately address matters communicated by us to the audit committee; or

- Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code – the parts of the directors’ statement on
page 58 required under the Listing Rules relating to the company’s compliance with the UK Corporate Governance
Code containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not
properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code.


We have nothing
to report in
respect of
these matters


RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the parent company’s ability
to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis
of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no
realistic alternative but to do so.

## INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF DRAX GROUP PLC continued

AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is
a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Details of the extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud are set out below.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at:
[www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.](http://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities)

EXTENT TO WHICH THE AUDIT WAS CONSIDERED CAPABLE OF DETECTING IRREGULARITIES, INCLUDING FRAUD
We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and then design
and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, including obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide
a basis for our opinion.

Identifying and assessing potential risks related to irregularities
In identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with laws
and regulations, our procedures included the following:

- enquiring of management, internal audit and the audit committee, including obtaining and reviewing supporting documentation,
concerning the Group’s policies and procedures relating to:

–identifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any instances of non-compliance;–

–detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud;–

–the internal controls established to mitigate risks related to fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations;–

- discussing among the engagement team including all component audit teams and involving relevant internal specialists, including
tax, pensions, IT and financial instrument specialists, regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and
any potential indicators of fraud. As part of this discussion, we identified the potential for possible fraud risk in the following areas:
the impairment of fixed assets, the valuation of commodity and foreign exchange contracts, the cut off risk for unbilled and billed
revenue, the presentation of the Consolidated income statement and the use of working capital transactions to potentially enhance
cashflows; and

- obtaining an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that the Group operates in, focusing on those laws and
regulations that had a direct effect on the financial statements or that had a fundamental effect on the operations of the Group.
The key laws and regulations we considered in this context included the UK Companies Act, Listing Rules, Pensions legislation,
Tax legislation, and Regulations established by regulators in the key markets in which the Group operates, including the Office
of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem).

Audit response to risks identified
As a result of performing the above, we identified the presentation of the Consolidated income statement, valuation of commodity and
foreign exchange contracts and estimation of retail unbilled revenue as key audit matters. The key audit matters section of our report
explains the matters in more detail and also describes the specific procedures we performed in response to those key audit matters.

In addition to the above, our procedures to respond to risks identified included the following:

- reviewing the financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with relevant laws
and regulations discussed above;

- enquiring of management, the audit committee and in-house legal counsel concerning actual and potential litigation and claims;

- performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of material
misstatement due to fraud;

- reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance, reviewing internal audit reports and reviewing correspondence
with HMRC;

- in addressing the risk of fraud in the impairment of fixed assets, we have challenged management’s underlying assumptions and
future cash flow forecasts, benchmarked key market related assumptions including future commodity prices, support mechanisms
and discount rates against external data where available, and run sensitivity analysis to assess whether an impairment would be
required if a range of more conservative assumptions were adopted;

- in addressing the risk of fraud in revenue recognition, we have performed focussed testing on trades close to the year end combined
with analytical review procedures to assess accuracy and completeness of revenue recognised;

- in addressing the risk of fraud in the use of working capital transactions, we have challenged management on the rationale for all
transactions entered into and reviewed the accounting treatments adopted by management against the specific contractual terms
and arrangements associated with each individual transaction and reviewed the related disclosures in the financial statements; and


-----

- in addressing the risk of fraud through management override of controls, testing the appropriateness of journal entries and other
adjustments; assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias; and
evaluating the business rationale of any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business.

We also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement team members including
internal specialists and significant component audit teams, and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws
and regulations throughout the audit.

REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 2006.

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

- the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

- the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and of the parent company and their environment obtained in the course
of the audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception


Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

- we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

- adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit
have not been received from branches not visited by us; or

- the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.

Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors’
remuneration have not been made or the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited is not in
agreement with the accounting records and returns.

Other matters

Auditor tenure
Following the recommendation of the audit committee, we were appointed by the shareholders at the Annual
General Meeting on 25 April 2018 to audit the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2018 and
subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and
reappointments of the firm is 14 years, covering the years ending 31 December 2005 to 2018, inclusive.

Consistency of the audit report with the additional report to the audit committee
Our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the audit committee we are required to provide in
accordance with ISAs (UK).

## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INTRODUCTION
The consolidated financial statements provide detailed
information about the financial performance (Consolidated
income statement), financial position (Consolidated balance
sheet), and cash flows (Consolidated cash flow statement) of
Drax Group plc (the Company) together with all of the entities
controlled by the Company (collectively, the Group).

The notes to the financial statements provide additional information
on the items in the Consolidated income statement, Consolidated
balance sheet and Consolidated cash flow statement. The notes
include explanations of the information presented. In general, the
additional information in the notes to the financial statements is
required by law, International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) or other regulations to facilitate increased understanding
of the primary statements set out on pages 118-122.

BASIS OF PREPARATION
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and therefore the
consolidated financial statements comply with Article 4 of the
EU IAS Regulation and the Companies Act 2006.

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical
cost basis, except for certain assets and liabilities that are
measured at fair value (principally derivative financial instruments
and those acquired as part of business combinations) and the
assets and liabilities of the Group’s defined benefit pension
schemes (measured at fair value and using the projected unit credit
method respectively).

Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at
the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. At each
balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates
prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items are not retranslated.

Foreign exchange gains and losses arising on such revaluations
are recognised in the income statement within finance costs.

Foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations with a
functional currency other than sterling are translated into
sterling using published exchange rates at the reporting date.
The income and expenditure of such operations are translated
into sterling using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of
the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting
from the retranslation of the operation’s net assets and its results
for the year are recognised in the Consolidated statement
of comprehensive income.

Going concern
The Group’s business activities, along with future developments
that may affect its financial performance, position and cash flows,
are discussed within the Strategic report on pages 1 to 49 of this
Annual Report.

In the viability statement on page 42 the directors state that
they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able
to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due
over the next three years


Consequently, the directors also have a reasonable expectation
that the Group will continue in existence for the next 12 months
and, therefore, have adopted the going concern basis in preparing
these financial statements.

Basis of consolidation
These consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial
results of the Company and of all entities controlled by the
Company, (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year.
The Company owns 100% of the equity of all subsidiaries.

The Group acquired and gained control of ScottishPower
Generation Limited (subsequently renamed Drax Generation
Enterprise Limited), a company that owns and operates a portfolio
of UK hydro, pumped storage and gas-fired generation assets, at
23:59 on 31 December 2018 (the Acquired Generation Business).
The assets and liabilities acquired have been included in the
Group’s Consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2018.
Due to the timing of the acquisition, no income, expenditure or
cash flows are included in the Group’s consolidated financial
statements in respect of the Acquired Generation Business.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The significant accounting policies for the measurement of an
individual item in the financial statements are described in the
note to the financial statements relating to the item concerned
(see contents on page 117).

The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the
consolidated financial statements are consistent with those
followed in the preparation of the Group’s annual consolidated
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017, except
for the adoption of new standards effective as of 1 January 2018.
The Group has not early-adopted any standard, interpretation or
amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective.

A full listing of new standards, interpretations and
pronouncements under IFRS applicable to these financial
statements is presented in note 8.2. The application of new
requirements has not had a material effect on the financial
statements, other than in respect of IFRS 9. The transition to
IFRS 9 is described in note 8.3.

Note 8.2 also includes the anticipated impact of IFRS 16 which
will affect the financial statements in future periods.

JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements requires judgement to be
applied in forming the Group’s accounting policies. It also requires
the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results
may differ from these estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an
ongoing basis, with revisions recognised in the period in which
the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.

The judgements involving a higher degree of estimation or
complexity are set out below and in more detail, including
sensitivity analysis where appropriate, in the related notes.


-----

Critical accounting judgements
The critical judgements made in the process of applying the
Group’s accounting policies during the year that have the most
significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial
statements are set out below.

Capacity market – on 15 November 2018 the General Court of the
Court of Justice of the European Union found in favour of a claim
against the European Commission, annulling the Commission’s
State aid approval of the UK Capacity Market. This ruling imposed
a standstill period on the Capacity Market, with payments under
existing contracts and future capacity auctions suspended
indefinitely until reapproval. The Government have since
announced that they expect the Capacity Market to be reinstated
during 2019, and that back-dated payments will be made to
generators who have complied with their capacity obligations
during the standstill period.

Following the ruling, the Group ceased to accrue capacity
market income in Generation. Revenue accrued but unpaid
during the period from 1 October was derecognised due to
the current uncertainty over the recovery of these amounts
(totalling £7 million).

Reflecting previous Government consultations and the
announcement on 7 February 2019 that the Collection Agent
expects to recommence collection of the supplier charge from
March 2019, including amounts relating to the standstill period,
Capacity Market costs have been accrued in the B2B Energy
Supply business in full.

The impact of this approach on the Group’s financial statements
is a reduction in revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of approximately
£7 million.

See note 7.6 on page 171

On the basis the Group expects the Capacity Market to be
reinstated during 2019, with back-payments made to generators,
the suspension has not had a material impact on estimates of
future cash flows for the purpose of impairment analyses in the
Generation business, including the OCGT development projects.

See note 2.4 on page 128 and note 5.3 on page 150

Certain remeasurements and exceptional items – management
makes judgements regarding transactions to exclude from the
Adjusted Results of the Group, as described under Alternative
Performance Measures, below.

See note 2.7 on page 132

Acquisition accounting – having assessed the circumstances of
the transaction to purchase the Acquired Generation Business on
31 December 2018, it was concluded that the transaction
represented the acquisition of a business and not an asset
purchase. The Group acquired assets, people and processes.
Accordingly, the transaction has been treated as a business
combination in the financial statements.


Sources of estimation uncertainty
The following are the sources of estimation uncertainty that
carry the most significant risk of a material effect on next year’s
accounts – that is, the items where actual outcomes in the next
12 months could vary significantly from the estimates made in
determining the reported amount of an asset or liability.

Property, plant and equipment – property, plant and equipment
is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its useful economic
life. Useful economic lives are estimated and based on past
experience, future replacement cycles and other available
evidence. Useful economic lives are reviewed annually.

See note 3.1 on page 135

Fair value of acquired assets and liabilities – the assets and
liabilities of the Acquired Generation Business have been
recognised at fair value in the Group’s Consolidated balance sheet.
The fair values of the property, plant and equipment have been
calculated based on their depreciated replacement cost, before
adjusting to reflect either a premium for immediate availability or
a provision for economic obsolescence, as appropriate.

In addition, the terms of the acquisition include a risk-sharing
mechanism with the vendor that may result in a change to the
overall level of consideration payable in the event UK Capacity
Market payments are not received during 2019. A further payment
may be made by the vendor, or by the Group, as applicable. The
value and beneficiary of the further payment is dependent upon
the gross profit achieved by the acquired business in 2019 and is
capped at £26 million, as described in the Circular of 5 December
2018, published on the Group’s website.

On the basis the Group believes that the Capacity Market will be
reinstated during 2019, with back-payments made to generators,
the fair value of the contingent payment at 31 December 2018 is
considered to be £nil. The contingent arrangement could increase
or decrease the fair value of the acquisition consideration in these
financial statements by up to £26 million.

See note 5.1 on page 148

Impairment – an impairment review is conducted annually of
goodwill and of other assets and cash-generating units where an
indicator of possible impairment exists. In 2018, an impairment
assessment has been completed for three of the Group’s CGUs
which have allocated goodwill or intangible assets with an
indefinite life. The assessment of future cash flows that underpins
such a review is based on management’s best estimate of retail
margins, future commodity prices, supply volumes, the capacity
market and economic conditions.

See note 2.4 on page 128 and notes 5.2 and 5.3 on page 150


-----

## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued


Derivatives – derivative financial instruments are recorded in the
Group’s balance sheet at fair value. The assessment of fair value
is derived from assuming a market price for the instrument in
question. The Group bases its assessment of market prices upon
forward curves that are largely derived from readily obtainable
quotations and third party sources. However, any forward
curve is based at least in part upon assumptions about future
transactions and market movements. Where such instruments
extend beyond the liquid portion of the forward curve, the
level of estimation increases as the number of observable
transactions decreases.

See note 7.2 on page 167

Revenue recognition – the nature of some of the Group’s
activities, particularly within the B2B Energy Supply segment,
results in revenue being based on the estimated volumes of
power supplied to customers at an estimated average price per
unit. Assumptions that underpin these estimates are applied
consistently and comparison of past estimates to final settlements
suggests a high degree of accuracy. However, actual outcomes
may vary from initial estimates.

Revenue from contracts satisfied over time is recognised in line
with the progress of those contracts. Assumptions are applied
consistently but actual outcomes may vary from initial estimates.

See note 2.2 on page 125

Pensions – the Group records a net surplus or liability in its
balance sheet for its obligation to provide benefits under
approved defined benefit pension schemes, less the fair value
of assets held by the pension schemes. The actuarial valuation
of the scheme assets and liabilities is performed annually and
depends on assumptions regarding interest rates, inflation,
future salary and pension increases, mortality and other factors,
any of which are subject to future change.

An actuarial gain on the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme
has resulted in an accounting surplus arising on the Group’s
defined benefit pension scheme at 31 December 2018. The terms
of the Trust Deed allow the Group to recover any surplus once
the liabilities of the scheme have been settled; accordingly, the
surplus has been recognised in full as a non-current asset on the
balance sheet. The net surplus in 2018 includes an initial estimate
of amounts due in respect of the Guaranteed Minimum Pension
to equalise pension benefits for men and women, following a
High Court ruling in October 2018.

See note 6.3 on page 157

Taxation – in accounting for both current and deferred tax the
Group makes assumptions regarding the likely treatment of items
of income and expenditure for tax purposes. These assumptions
are based on interpretation of relevant legislation and, where
required, consultation with external advisers.

See note 2.6 on page 130


ADOPTION OF IFRS 9 AND IFRS 15
In the year ended 31 December 2018, the Group has applied IFRS 15
‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ and IFRS 9 ‘Financial
Instruments’ for the first time.

During the year, the Group reviewed the presentation of gains and
losses on derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for
hedge accounting in the consolidated income statement. Following
this review, the Group has elected to present these amounts in the
line item most closely related to the underlying commodity contract.
Previously unrealised gains and losses were presented separately. In
addition, the Group has elected to apply the ‘cost of hedging’ provisions
of IFRS 9, resulting in certain unrealised gains and losses previously
recognised in the income statement being recognised in reserves.

Both of these changes have been applied retrospectively and
the prior year financial statements have been restated. See note 8.3
for further details.

Adoption of IFRS 15 has not resulted in any changes to the timing
or amount of revenue recognised. See note 8.3 for further details.

ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES (APMS)
The Group’s financial performance for the period, measured in
accordance with IFRS, is shown in the “Total Results” column on
the face of the income statement. Exceptional items and certain
remeasurements are deducted from the Total Results in arriving
at the “Adjusted Results” for the year. The Group’s Adjusted Results
are consistent with the way executive management and the Board
assess the performance of the Group, and are intended to reflect the
underlying trading performance of the Group’s businesses and are
presented to assist users of the accounts in evaluating the Group’s
trading performance and performance against strategic objectives.

Exceptional items are those transactions that, by their nature, do not
reflect the trading performance of the Group in the period. For
a transaction to be considered exceptional, management considers
the nature of the transaction, the frequency of similar events,
previous precedent and commercial context. Exceptional items
are approved by the Audit Committee.

Certain remeasurements comprise fair value gains and losses on
derivative forward contracts to the extent those contracts do not
qualify for hedge accounting, or hedge accounting is not effective,
which under IFRS are recorded in revenue or cost of sales as
described above. The Group regards all of its forward contracting
activity to represent an economic hedge. The impact of excluding
these fair value remeasurements is to reflect commodity sales and
purchases at contracted prices (the price paid or received in respect
of delivery of the commodity in question), taking into account the
impact of financial trading (such as forward foreign currency
purchases), in the Adjusted Results.

Further information on exceptional items and certain
remeasurements in the current and previous period is included
in note 2.7 to the financial statements.

The Group presents an additional subtotal in the Adjusted Results
column. Adjusted EBITDA is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortisation, excluding the impact of exceptional items and
certain remeasurements. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure
used by the Board and executive management to assess the financial
performance of the Group.

## SECTION 2: FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

The financial performance section gives further information about the items in the Consolidated income statement. It includes a
summary of financial performance by each of the Group’s businesses (note 2.1), analysis of certain income statement items (notes
2.2–2.6) and information regarding the Adjusted and Total Results, distributable profits and dividends (notes 2.7–2.10). Further
commentary on the Group’s trading and operational performance during the year, which is predominantly reflected in Adjusted
EBITDA, can be found in the Strategic report on pages 1 to 49, with particular reference to key transactions and market conditions
that have affected the results.

2.1 SEGMENTAL REPORTING
The Group is organised into three businesses, with a dedicated management team for each and a central corporate office providing
certain specialist and shared functions. Our businesses are:

- Power Generation: power generation activities in the UK;

- Pellet Production: production of sustainable compressed wood pellets at our processing facilities in the US; and

- B2B Energy Supply: supply of electricity and gas to business customers in the UK.

The generation assets acquired from ScottishPower will form part of the Power Generation segment. No profit or loss has been
recognised in respect of these assets in 2018 as the assets were acquired at 23:59 on 31 December 2018.

The operating segments are consistent with the prior year. Each business is an operating segment for the purpose of segmental
reporting. Information reported to the Board for the purposes of assessing performance and making investment decisions is based on
these three operating segments. The measure of profit or loss for each reportable segment presented to the Board on a regular basis
is Adjusted EBITDA (as defined on page 116).

Operating costs are allocated to segments to the extent they are directly attributable to the activities of that segment. Corporate
office costs are included within central costs.

Segment revenues and results
The following is an analysis of the Group’s performance by reporting segment for the year ended 31 December 2018. The Board

The accounting policies applied for the purpose of measuring the segments’ profits or losses, assets and liabilities are the same as
those used in measuring the corresponding amounts in the Group’s financial statements. The external revenues and results of all the
reporting segments are subject to seasonality, with higher dispatch and prices in the winter months compared to summer months.

Capital expenditure by segment
Assets and working capital are monitored on a consolidated basis; however, spend on capital projects is monitored by
operating segment.

Total cash outflows in relation to capital expenditure during the year were £132.6 million (2017: £174.7 million). Key capital investments
in the year include the conversion of the fourth unit at Drax Power Station to run on biomass fuel and preparatory work for the
repowering of the fifth and sixth units to gas (Power Generation); investment in digital transformation in the B2B Energy Supply
segment; and expansion projects in the Pellet Production segment. The prior year includes £48 million for the purchase of the LaSalle
Bioenergy pellet plant.


-----

2.1 SEGMENTAL REPORTING continued
Intra-group trading
Intra-group transactions are carried out at management’s best estimate of arm’s-length, commercial terms that, where possible,
equate to market prices at the time of the transaction. During 2018, the Pellet Production segment sold wood pellets with a total value
of £213.7 million (2017: £135.7 million) to the Power Generation segment and the Power Generation segment sold electricity, gas and
ROCs with a total value of £1,336.7 million (2017: £1,033.4 million) to the B2B Energy Supply segment.

The impact of all intra-group transactions, including any unrealised profit arising, is eliminated on consolidation.

Major customers
Total consolidated revenue for the year ended 31 December 2018 includes £555.8 million from one individual customer (2017: no
amounts from any individual customer) that represented 10% or more of total revenue for the year. These revenues arose in the
Power Generation segment.

2.2 REVENUE
Accounting policy
The Group has adopted IFRS 15 for the first time in 2018. The accounting policies have been updated, however the amount and timing
of revenue recognition in the Group’s financial statements is unchanged (see note 8.3).

Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods or services provided to customers in the normal course of business, net of trade
discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes and excluding transactions between Group companies.

Revenues from the sale of electricity by our Power Generation business are measured based upon metered output delivered at rates
specified under contract terms or prevailing market rates as applicable.

Following conversion of the fourth unit in July 2018, three biomass-fuelled generating units at Drax Power Station earn Renewable
Obligation Certificates (ROCs) under the UK Government’s Renewables Obligation (RO) regime. The financial benefit of a ROC is
recognised in the income statement at the point the relevant renewable biomass fuel is burnt and power dispatched as a reduction
in the cost of the biomass fuel. A corresponding asset is recognised on the balance sheet (see note 3.3). Revenue from sale of ROCs
is recognised when the ROC is transferred to a third party.

The Group recognises the income or costs arising from the CfD (see below) in the income statement as a component of revenue at
the point the Group meets its performance obligation under the CfD contract. This is considered to be the point at which the relevant
generation is delivered and the payment becomes contractually due.

Revenue from the sale of electricity and gas directly to business customers through the B2B Energy Supply business is recognised
on the supply of electricity or gas when a contract exists, supply has taken place, a quantifiable price has been established or can be
determined and the receivables are expected to be recovered at the point of sale. Energy supplied is measured based upon metered
consumption and contractual rates; however, where a supply has taken place but is not yet measured or billed, the revenue is
estimated based on consumption statistics and selling price estimates and is recognised as accrued income.

Revenue for contracts satisfied over time is recognised in line with the progress of those contracts. The measurement of progress is
based on cost inputs for fixed price B2B Energy Supply contracts, and volume supplied for other contracts. Assumptions are applied
consistently but third party costs can be variable, therefore actual outcomes may vary from initial estimates.

The Group is eligible for, and therefore applies, the practical expedient available in IFRS 15 and has not disclosed information related
to the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations. The right to receive consideration from a customer is at an
amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Group’s performance completed to date.

Other revenues derived from the provision of services to National Grid (for example, the supply of system support services) are
recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contractual performance obligations. Most such contracts are for the
delivery of a service either continually or on an ad-hoc basis over a period of time and thus stage of completion is calculated by
reference to the amount of the contract term that has elapsed. Depending on the contract terms this approach may require judgement
in estimating probable future outcomes.

Other revenues derived from the sale of goods (for example, by-products from electricity generation such as ash and gypsum)
are recognised at the point the control of the goods is transferred to the customer, typically at the point of delivery to the
customer’s premises.


-----

## SECTION 2: FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE continued

2.2 REVENUE continued
CfD payments
The Group is party to a Contract for Difference (CfD) with the Low Carbon Contracts Company (LCCC), a Government-owned entity
responsible for delivering elements of the Government’s Electricity Market Reform Programme. Under the contract, the Group makes
or receives payments in respect of electricity dispatched from a specific biomass-fuelled generating unit. The payment is calculated
by reference to a strike price of £100 per MWh. The base year for the strike price was 2012 and it increases each year in line with
the UK Consumer Price Index and changes in system balancing costs. The strike price at 31 December 2018 was £111 per MWh.

When market prices at the point of generation are above/below the strike price, the Group makes/receives an additional payment to/
from LCCC equivalent to the difference between the market power price at the point of dispatch and the strike price. Such payments
are in addition to amounts received from the sale of the power in the wholesale market and either increase or limit the total income
from the power dispatched from the relevant generating unit to the strike price in the CfD contract.

ROC sales
The generation and sale of ROCs is a key driver of the Group’s financial performance. The RO scheme places an obligation on electricity
suppliers to source an increasing proportion of their electricity from renewable sources. Under the RO, ROCs are certificates issued
to generators of renewable electricity which are then sold to bilateral counterparties, including suppliers to demonstrate that they
have fulfilled their obligations under the RO. ROCs are managed in compliance periods (CPs), running from April to March annually,
CP1 commenced in April 2002. At 31 December 2018 we are in CP17.

To meet its obligations a supplier can either submit ROCs or pay the “buy-out” price at the end of the CP. The buy-out price was set
at £30 per ROC in CP1 and rises with inflation. The buy-out price in CP17 is £47.22. ROCs are typically procured in arm’s-length
transactions with renewable generators at a market price typically slightly lower than the buy-out price for that CP. At the end of the
CP, the amounts collected from suppliers paying the buy-out price form the “recycle fund”, which is distributed on a pro-rata basis
to ROC generators.

The financial benefit of a ROC recognised in the income statement at the point of generation is thus comprised of two parts: the
expected value to be obtained in a sale transaction with a third party supplier and the expected recycle fund benefit to be received
at the end of the CP. During the year, the Group made sales (and related purchases) of ROCs to help optimise our working capital
position. External sales of ROCs in the table below include £555.8 million of such sales (2017: £201.2 million), with a similar value
reflected in cost of sales. See note 3.3 for further details of ROCs generated and sold by the Power Generation business and those
utilised by the B2B Energy Supply business in the year.

2.4 REVIEW OF FIXED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT
Accounting policy
The Group reviews its fixed assets (or, where appropriate, groups of assets known as cash-generating units (CGUs)) whenever there is
an indication that an impairment loss may have been suffered. The Group assesses the existence of indicators of impairment annually.
The Group considers the smallest collections of assets that generate independent cash flows to be its operating entities (Drax Power,
Haven Power, Opus Energy, Drax Biomass and the OCGTs) and accordingly considers the Group to be comprised of five CGUs.

The assets of the Acquired Generation Business have been recognised on the Group’s Consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December
2018 at fair value (see note 5.1). These assets are therefore not included in the impairment review at 31 December 2018.

If an indication of potential impairment exists, the recoverable amount of the asset or CGU in question is assessed with reference to the
present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the continuing use of the asset or CGU (value in use) or the expected
price that would be received to sell the asset to another market participant (fair value less costs to sell). The initial assessment of
recoverable amount is normally based on value in use.

Where value in use is calculated, the assessment of future cash flows is based on the most recent approved business plan and includes
all of the necessary costs expected to be incurred to generate the cash inflows from the CGU’s assets in their current state and
condition, including an allocation of centrally managed costs. Central costs are only allocated where they are necessary for and directly
attributable to the CGU’s activities. Future cash flows include, where relevant, contracted cash flows arising from our cash flow hedging
activities and as a result the carrying amount of each CGU includes the mark-to-market value of those cash flow hedges.

The additional value that could be obtained from enhancing or converting the Group’s assets is not reflected, nor the potential benefit of
any future restructuring or reorganisation. In determining value in use, the estimate of future cash flows is discounted to present value
using a pre-tax rate reflecting the specific risks attributable to the CGU in question.

If the recoverable amount is less than the current carrying amount in the financial statements, a provision is made to reduce the carrying
amount of the asset or CGU to the estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised immediately in the income statement.


-----

2.4 REVIEW OF FIXED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT continued
Assessment of indicators of impairment
A review of the Group’s CGUs did not give rise to any indicators of impairment. Accordingly no detailed impairment calculation has
been completed for CGUs where no goodwill is allocated (Drax Power and Drax Biomass). The review considered the effect on
previously calculated headroom of movements in market prices for commodities and changes in foreign exchange rates. The review
also considered the impact of the recent suspension in Capacity Market payments. The Group’s core planning assumption reflects the
belief that the UK electricity market needs a capacity mechanism to ensure continuity of supply and that the Capacity Market will be
reinstated during 2019. As a result, estimates of future cash flows are not materially affected by the current suspension. Separate
consideration has been given to the impact on the OCGT development assets, see note 5.3.

2.5 NET FINANCE COSTS
Finance costs reflect expenses incurred in managing our debt structure (such as interest payable on our bonds) as well as foreign
exchange gains and losses, the unwinding of discount on provisions for reinstatement of our sites at the end of their useful lives
(see note 5.4) and net interest charged on the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme obligation (see note 6.3). These are offset by
interest income that the Group generates through efficient use of short-term cash surpluses – for example through investment in
money market funds.

On 26 April 2018, the Group issued loan notes of USD $300 million, listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. The proceeds of the issue
were used to repay in full the £200 million floating rate loan notes issued in 2017. Incremental costs of the new borrowing (£3.8 million)
have been deferred and are being amortised over the period to maturity of the debt instrument. Deferred costs of £5.2 million in relation
to the floating rate notes have been written off in the period, in addition to an early repayment charge of £2.0 million (2017: deferred
costs of £10.4 million and early repayment charges of £13.8 million in relation to the refinancing of the Group’s previous debt structure).

As described in note 2.7, these costs have been excluded from the Adjusted Results and are presented as exceptional items in arriving
at Total Results. Further information about the Group’s financing structure can be found in note 4.3.

## SECTION 2: FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE continued

2.6 CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAXATION
The tax charge includes both current and deferred tax. Current tax is the estimated amount of tax payable on this year’s taxable profits
(which are adjusted for items upon which the Group is not required to pay tax or, in some cases, for items which are not allowable for
tax purposes and therefore on which additional tax is required) and adjusted for estimates for previous years. Deferred tax is an
accounting adjustment which reflects where more or less tax is expected to arise in the future due to differences between the
accounting and tax rules. This is reflected in differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet
and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profits. The tax credit reflects the estimated effective tax rate on
the loss before tax for the Group for the year ended 31 December 2018 and the movement in the deferred tax balance in the year, so far
as it relates to items recognised in the income statement.

Accounting policy
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is based on the taxable profit or loss for the year in the relevant jurisdiction.
Taxable profit or loss differs from profit/loss before tax as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or
expenditure that are either taxable or deductible in other years or never taxable/deductible. The Group’s liability (or asset) for current
tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are
generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that
taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.

Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive
income or directly in equity, in which case the current and deferred tax are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in
equity respectively.

Significant estimation uncertainty
In accounting for taxation the Group makes assumptions regarding the treatment of items of income and expenditure for tax
purposes. The Group believes that these assumptions are reasonable based on prior experience and consultation with advisers. Full
provision is made for deferred taxation at the rates of tax prevailing at the period end date unless future rates have been substantively
enacted. Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is considered more likely than not that they will be recovered. Where such assets
relate to losses incurred by a business unit, particularly one with a history of losses, the Group seeks evidence other than its own
internal forecasts to support recognition of the related deferred tax asset.

UK corporation tax is the main rate of tax for the Group and is calculated at 19.00% (2017: 19.25%) of the assessable profit or loss for the
year. Tax for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised
based on jurisdictional tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

The tax charge for the year can be reconciled to the profit before tax as follows:

As a result of the reduction in the US federal tax rates from 2018 to 21%, and tax relief now arising to the Group from the UK Patent Box
regime (see below), in the medium term we anticipate our Group underlying effective tax rate to be marginally lower than the main rate
of corporation tax in the UK. Drax Power was granted a patent to protect certain intellectual property it owns and which attaches to
the technology developed to manage the combustion process in generating electricity from biomass. Under UK tax legislation the
Company is now entitled to apply a lower rate of tax to some of its profits each year which are derived from utilisation of that
technology. Adjustments in respect of prior periods includes a claim agreed in respect of the Patent Box regime for previous years
of £4.8 million (2017: £10.3 million).

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to do so, otherwise they are shown
separately in the balance sheet.

Within the above deferred tax balances is a net deferred tax asset of £31.8 million (2017: £22.7 million) in relation to start-up losses and other
temporary differences in the US-based Pellet Production business. Based on its business plan and reflecting continuing improvement in
operational performance, the Group anticipates generating sufficient profits in future periods against which to utilise this asset.

2.7 CERTAIN REMEASUREMENTS AND EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
The Group reflects its underlying financial results in the Adjusted Results column of the Consolidated income statement. In order to
provide a clear and consistent view of trading performance, certain remeasurements and exceptional items are presented in a separate
column. The Group believes that this presentation provides useful information about the financial performance of the business and
is consistent with the way executive management, the Board and the analysts assess the performance of the business.

The Group has a framework for the determination of transactions as exceptional. Transactions presented as exceptional are approved
by the Audit Committee.

In these financial statements, the following transactions have been designated as exceptional items and presented separately:

- Acquisition and restructuring costs associated with the acquisition and on-boarding of ScottishPower Generation Limited (2018)
and Opus Energy Group Limited (2017) into the Group, along with costs associated with the restructuring of the Pellet Production
d B2B E S l b i


-----

2.7 CERTAIN REMEASUREMENTS AND EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS continued

- Costs incurred as a result of restructuring the Group’s debt in 2018 and 2017, including facility break costs and the acceleration
of the amortisation of deferred finance costs associated with the redeemed facilities.

- Asset obsolescence charges relating to coal-specific assets written-off following the conversion of the fourth unit at Drax Power
Station to run on biomass.

Certain remeasurements comprise gains or losses on derivative contracts to the extent that those contracts do not qualify for hedge
accounting, or hedge accounting is not effective, and those gains or losses are either i) unrealised and relate to the delivery of
commodity contracts in future periods, or ii) are realised in relation to the delivery of commodity contracts in the current period.
The effect of excluding certain remeasurements from the Adjusted Results is to reflect commodity sales and purchases at contracted
prices – i.e. at the all-in-hedged amount paid or received in respect of the delivery of the commodity in question, to better present the
trading performance of the Group in Adjusted Results.

2.8 EARNINGS PER SHARE
Earnings per share (EPS) represents the amount of earnings (post-tax profits) attributable to each ordinary share in issue. Basic EPS is
calculated by dividing the Group’s earnings (profit after tax in accordance with IFRS) by the weighted average number of ordinary
shares that were in issue during the year. Diluted EPS demonstrates the impact if all outstanding share options that are expected to
vest on their future maturity dates (such as those to be issued under employee share schemes – see note 6.2) were exercised and
treated as ordinary shares as at the balance sheet date.

At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting the Board will recommend to shareholders that a resolution is passed to approve payment
of a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2018 of 8.5 pence per share (equivalent to approximately £33.6 million) payable on
or before 10 May 2019. The final dividend has not been included as a liability as at 31 December 2018. This would bring total dividends
payable in respect of the 2018 financial year to £56.0 million.

In future years, if there is a build-up of capital in excess of the Group’s investment needs, the Board will consider the most appropriate
mechanism to return this to shareholders.

2.10 RETAINED PROFITS
Retained profits are a component of equity reserves. The overall balance reflects the total profits the Group has generated over its
lifetime, reduced by the amount of that profit distributed to shareholders. The table below sets out the movements in retained profits

Distributable profits
The capacity of the Group to make dividend payments is primarily determined by the availability of retained distributable profits
and cash resources.

The Parent Company financial statements, set out on pages 182 to 187 of this Annual report, disclose the Parent Company’s
distributable reserves of £233.6 million. Sufficient reserves are available across the Group as a whole to make future distributions
in accordance with the Group’s dividend policy for the foreseeable future.

The majority of the Group’s distributable reserves are held in holding and operating subsidiaries. Management actively monitors
the level of distributable reserves in each company in the Group, ensuring adequate reserves are available for upcoming dividend
payments and that the Parent Company has access to these reserves.

The immediate cash resources of the Group of £289.0 million are set out in note 4.2 and the recent history of cash generation within
note 4.4. The majority of these cash resources are held centrally within the Group by Drax Corporate Limited for treasury management
purposes and are available for funding the working capital and other requirements of the Group.

The Group’s financing facilities (see note 4.3) place certain conditions on the amount of dividend payments to be made in any given
year. The Group expects to be able to make dividend payments, in line with its policy, within these conditions for the foreseeable future.

## SECTION 3: OPERATING ASSETS AND WORKING CAPITAL

This section gives further information on the operating assets we use to generate revenue and the short-term liquid assets and
liabilities, managed during day-to-day operations, that comprise our working capital balances.

3.1 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
This note shows the cost, depreciation and net book value of the physical assets controlled by us that we use in our businesses to
generate revenue. The cost of an asset is what we paid to purchase or construct the asset. Depreciation reflects the usage of the asset
over time and is calculated by taking the cost of the asset, net of any residual value, to the income statement evenly over the useful
economic life of the asset. An asset’s net book value is its cost less any depreciation (including impairment, if required) charged to date.

Accounting policy
Property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost. Cost comprises the purchase price (after deducting trade discounts and
rebates), any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the
manner intended by management and the estimate of the present value of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring
the site. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment in value.

We construct many of our assets as part of long-term development projects. Assets that are in the course of construction are not
depreciated until they are ready for us to use in the way intended. This category has been shown separately for the first time in 2018.

Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write down assets to their residual value evenly over their estimated useful
economic lives (UEL) of the assets from the date of acquisition (where relevant, limited to the expected decommissioning date of the
power station – currently expected to be 2039). The table below shows the range of useful lives at the date of acquisition and the
average remaining useful life at the balance sheet date of the main categories of asset we own in years:


Average UEL
remaining


Range of
UELs at
acquisition


Freehold buildings 23 8–33

Plant and equipment

Electricity generation assets:

Drax Power Station common plant 13 2–33

Drax Power Station biomass-specific assets 17 2–26

Drax Power Station coal-specific assets 5 3–19

Pellet production plant 14 5–20

Other plant, machinery and equipment 5 1–33

Decommissioning asset 21 34

Plant spare parts 21 Up to 34

Freehold land held at cost is considered to have an unlimited useful life and is not depreciated.

Electricity generation assets are grouped according to the fuel type of the plant. Certain assets at Drax Power Station are common
to the whole plant and are shown separately.

Pellet production plant includes the US-based assets of the Group’s Pellet Production segment.

Within the plant and equipment categories shorter lives are attributed to components that are overhauled and upgraded as part
of rolling outage cycles. The majority of assets within these categories have a remaining useful life in excess of 15 years.

Plant spare parts are depreciated over the remaining useful life of the power station.

Costs relating to major inspections, overhauls and upgrades to the power station are included in the asset’s carrying amount or
recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, if the recognition criteria are met; namely, when it is probable that future economic
benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and
maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually, taking into account regulatory change and commercial and
technological obsolescence, as well as normal wear and tear. Residual values are based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Any changes are applied prospectively.


-----

## SECTION 3: OPERATING ASSETS AND WORKING CAPITAL continued

3.1 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT continued
Significant estimation uncertainty
Asset lives are reviewed annually at each balance sheet date. Following the Government’s announcement relating to the cessation of
coal generation, the Group concluded that coal generation will cease during 2025, but that the two existing coal units will be retained
for conversion to alternative fuels in the period to 2039. The useful lives of electricity generation plant currently fuelled by biomass are
unaffected by this change. No changes to the useful economic lives of assets have been made as a result of the most recent review.

At each balance sheet date the Group reviews its property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that
these assets may be impaired. The Group’s accounting policy in respect of impairment, along with details of the impairment review
conducted during 2018, are set out in note 2.4.

Plant and equipment includes assets held under finance lease agreements with a carrying value at 31 December 2018 of £0.9 million
(2017: £1.1 million).

Issues and transfers reflect changes in the categorisation of assets during the period e.g. when an asset under construction is
complete, it is transferred to the relevant depreciable asset category, or the issue of spare parts for use in repair and maintenance
projects. When spares are utilised in such projects, the cost of the part is transferred from the property, plant and equipment balance
and recognised as an expense in the income statement within operating costs.

3.2 OTHER FIXED ASSET INVESTMENTS
Other fixed asset investments include equity investments held by the Group.

Accounting policy
Other fixed asset investments are recognised at fair value, based on quoted market prices where available, at the date of transfer. The
Group designates its investments as at fair value through other comprehensive income, as they are intended to be held and not traded,
in accordance with IFRS 9. Where quoted market prices are not available and investments cannot be fair valued, they are held at cost
and are reviewed for impairment annually.

## SECTION 3: OPERATING ASSETS AND WORKING CAPITAL continued

3.3 ROC ASSETS
We earn Renewable Obligation Certificate (ROC) assets, which are accredited by the Office for Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem),
as a result of burning sustainable compressed wood pellets to generate electricity. This note sets out the value of these assets that
we hold at the year end.

Accounting policy
ROCs are recognised as current assets in the period they are generated and are initially measured at fair value based on anticipated
sales prices. The value of ROCs earned is recognised in the income statement as a reduction in fuel costs in that period.

Where our B2B Energy Supply business incurs an obligation to deliver ROCs to Ofgem, that obligation is provided for in the
period incurred.

At each reporting date the Group reviews the carrying value of ROC assets held against updated anticipated sales prices.
Where relevant, this takes account of agreed forward sale contracts and the likely utilisation of ROCs generated to settle our
own ROC obligations. Any impairment is recognised in the period incurred.

Significant estimation uncertainty
The fair values and net realisable values of ROCs referred to above are calculated based on assumptions regarding future sales prices in
the market, taking into account agreed forward sale contracts where appropriate. Historic experience indicates that the assumptions
used in the valuation are reasonable; however, actual sales prices may differ from those assumed.

ROC valuations also include an estimate of the future benefit that may be obtained from the ROC recycle fund at the end of the
compliance period. The recycle fund provides a benefit where supplier buy-out charges (incurred by suppliers who do not procure
sufficient ROCs to satisfy their obligations) are paid over to renewable generators on a pro-rata basis. The estimate is based on
assumptions about likely levels of renewable generation and supply over the compliance period and is thus subject to some
uncertainty. The Group utilises external sources of information in addition to its own forecasts in making these estimates.
Past experience indicates that the values arrived at are reasonable but they remain subject to possible variation.

the production of compressed wood pellets. This note shows the cost of coal, biomass, other fuels and plant consumables held at the
end of the year, including items at Drax Power Station, our facilities in the US and those off-site locations.

Accounting policy
Our raw materials and fuel stocks are valued at the lower of the weighted average cost to purchase and net realisable value.

The cost of fuel stocks includes all direct costs and overheads incurred in bringing the fuel to its present location and condition,
including the purchase price, import duties and other taxes (including amounts levied on coal under the UK carbon price support
mechanism) and transport/handling costs. The Group uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge the costs
denominated in foreign currencies. Where these contracts are designated into hedge relationships in accordance with IFRS 9,
the stock cost is recognised at the hedged value. In previous periods, the cost of fuel stock also included gains and losses arising from
fair value changes on maturing derivative contracts that did not qualify for hedge accounting. This practice has been discontinued
and all such gains and losses are now included in cost of sales when they arise. The prior year has not been restated for this change


-----

3.4 INVENTORIES continued
Both coal and biomass stocks are weighed when entering, moving within or exiting our sites using technology regularly calibrated to
industry standards. Fuel burn in the electricity generation process is calculated using a combination of weights and thermal efficiency
calculations to provide closing stock volumes. Both calibrated weighers and efficiency calculations are subject to a range of tolerable
error. All fuel inventories are subject to regular surveys to ensure these measurements are sufficiently accurate.

Coal stocks are verified by an independent stock survey carried out by a suitably trained specialist and a provision is made where
the survey indicates a lower level of stock than indicated by the methods described above. Despite being an independent process,
the survey depends on estimates and assumptions and as a result actual values may differ.

The characteristics of biomass require specialist handling and storage. On-site biomass at Drax Power Station is stored in sealed
domes with a carefully controlled atmosphere for fire prevention purposes and thus cannot be surveyed using traditional methods.
Biomass stock is surveyed using regularly calibrated state-of-the-art RADAR scanning technology.

(2017: £1.5 million) and £0.9 million of work in progress (2017: £0.1 million) in our Pellet Production business.

Other fuels and consumables include £4.4 million of consumables acquired as part of the ScottishPower acquisition.

The cost of inventories recognised as an expense in the year ended 31 December 2018 was £1,601.1 million (2017: £1,285.8 million).

3.5 TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES
Trade receivables represent amounts owed to us by our customers for goods or services we have provided but not yet been paid for.
Accrued income represents income earned in the period but not yet invoiced, largely in respect of power delivered that will be invoiced
the following month.

Accounting policy
Trade and other receivables are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. A provision for
impairment of trade receivables is measured at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit loss. The transition to IFRS 9 has not
had a significant impact on the calculation of the provision.

Accrued income 197.0 203.7

Contract assets 4.3 5.3

Prepayments and other receivables 104.9 82.8

468.8 417.5

Trade receivables and accrued income principally represent sales of energy to counterparties within both our Power Generation
and B2B Energy Supply businesses. At 31 December 2018, the Group had amounts receivable from two (2017: five) significant
counterparties representing 12% (2017: 20%) of total trade receivables and accrued income.

Of total trade receivables and acrrued income at 31 December 2018 £266.6 million (2017: £255.7 million) relates to B2B Energy
Supply sales.

Contract assets have been separated from accrued income for the first time on application of IFRS 15. The 2017 figures have been
updated on the same basis. Contract assets relate to amounts for goods or services provided under customer contracts, where the
entitlement to consideration is contingent on something other than the passage of time. The Group has recognised a contract asset
for any work performed where payment is not yet due. Any amount previously recognised as a contract asset is reclassified to trade
receivables at the point at which it is invoiced to the customer usually in the following financial period

The movement in the allowance for doubtful debts is laid out in the following table:

Acquisition – 19.7

Amounts reversed as recovered (0.8) –

Changes in models/risks parameters (1.4) –

At 31 December 44.0 28.2

The Group does not consider there to be any requirement for further provisions in excess of the provision for doubtful debts of
£44.0 million (2017: £28.2 million). This provision, which principally relates to B2B Energy Supply receivables, has been determined using
a lifetime expected credit loss calculation. Assumptions made regarding the recoverability of balances have been determined with
reference to past default experiences in line with our policies and future prospects reflecting our understanding of our customer base.
Specific balances are provided against where default events have occurred. Balances are only written off if deemed irrecoverable after
all credit control procedures have been exhausted or the customer is in administration.

The expected credit loss rates have been reviewed and updated during 2018 in order to reflect current cash collection rates in the B2B
Energy Supply business and expectations of future cash collection rates. The change in rates applied has not had a material impact
on the total provision in the current period and is not expected to significantly impact future periods. However, it has resulted in more
balances having a provision applied. As a result, the value of trade receivables that are past due but are completely unprovided against,
in accordance with the assessment described above, has reduced to £1.2 million (2017: £32.2 million).

Credit and counterparty risk are both discussed in further detail in note 7.1.

In the B2B Energy Supply business amounts provided against trade and other receivables increased by £33.6 million in the year, with
a net charge in the income statement of £31.4 million, following a deterioration in cash collection rates in the first half of the year.
During the second half of the year, collection processes were reviewed and improved. We expect this improvement to be indicative
of future collection rates. At the end of the year, provisions of £44.0 million were £15.8 million higher than the end of the prior year.

The following table shows the risk profile of amounts due from customers based on the Group’s provision matrix at 31 December 2018.

Lifetime expected credit losses – £m 0.1 5.2 2.2 2.2 34.3 44.0

The expected credit loss rate is a weighted average for the portfolio of trade receivables associated with the B2B Energy Supply business.

The majority of balances not yet due are held in the Power Generation business where the risk of default is considered to be very low.
The analysis above excludes receivables acquired in business combinations – see note 5.1.


-----

3.6 CONTRACT COSTS
The Group incurs costs of obtaining contracts in the B2B Energy Supply businesses.

Accounting policy
Management expects that incremental broker fees paid to intermediaries as a result of obtaining electricity and gas contracts are
recoverable. The Group has therefore capitalised them as contract costs and amortises them on a straight line basis over the contract
period in line with the recognition of revenue. The balance is included within prepayments in note 3.5. This amount includes both
current and non-current balances.

Amounts capitalised on the Consolidated balance sheet were £39.0 million at 31 December 2018 (2017: £39.3 million). In 2018 the
amount of amortisation was £37.2 (2017: £24.4) and there was no impairment loss recognised.

3.7 TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES
Trade and other payables represent amounts we owe to our suppliers (for trade purchases and ongoing costs), tax authorities and
other creditors that are due to be paid in the ordinary course of business. We make accruals for amounts that will fall due for payment
in the future as a result of our activities in the current year (e.g. fuel we have received but for which we have not yet been invoiced).

Accounting policy
Trade and other payables are measured at amortised cost.

Energy supply accruals includes £235.5 million (2017: £225.0 million) in relation to the Group’s obligation to deliver ROCs arising
from B2B Energy Supply activities. The remaining balance principally comprises third party grid charge accruals of £51.7 million
(2017: £36.8 million) and Feed-in-Tariff accruals of £14.1 million (2017: 25.9 million).

The Group recognises a liability in respect of its unsettled obligations to deliver emissions allowances under the EU Emission Trading
Scheme (ETS). Accruals at 31 December 2018 include £nil (2017: £30.6 million) with respect to the Group’s estimated net liability
to deliver CO2 emissions allowances. Allowances are purchased in the market and are recorded at cost.

Other payables includes £87.0 million (2017: £Nil) due under payment facilities described in note 4.4.

Contract liabilities primarily relate to the advance consideration received from customers for fixed price electricity and gas contracts,
for which revenue is recognised based on the stage of completion of the multi-year contract. This has been shown separately for the
first time in 2018 due to the implementation of IFRS 15. The prior year has been restated to the same format. The balance reduces
as revenue is subsequently recognised in the following period, offset by further advance consideration received.

## SECTION 4: FINANCING AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE

This section provides further information about the Group’s capital structure (equity and debt financing) and cash generated from
operations during the year.

4.1 RECONCILIATION OF NET DEBT
Net debt is calculated by taking our borrowings (note 4.3) and subtracting cash and cash equivalents (note 4.2). The table below
reconciles net debt in terms of changes in these balances across the year.

Years ended 31 December

**2018** 2017
**£m** £m

Net debt at 1 January (367.4) (93.5)

Increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 65.6 (4.0)

Decrease/(increase) in borrowings 4.2 (267.8)

Effect of changes in foreign exchange rates (21.5) (2.1)

Net debt at 31 December (319.1) (367.4)

Borrowings includes listed bonds, bank debt, revolving credit facilities and finance leases, net of any deferred finance costs.
A reconciliation of the increase in borrowings during the year is set out in the table on page 143.

Borrowings at 31 December 2018 does not include the acquisition bridge facility that was drawn down after the balance sheet date on
2 January 2019, see note 4.3.

During 2018, the Group entered into a cross-currency interest rate swap, fixing the sterling value of the principal repayments in respect
of the Group’s US dollar denominated debt (see note 4.3). If US dollar balances are translated at the hedged rate, rather than the rate
prevailing at the balance sheet date, net debt would be reduced by £22.0 million (2017: £nil). The corresponding value of the hedging
instrument is recognised at its fair value as a derivative financial instrument, see note 7.2.

4.2 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents include cash held in current and other deposit accounts that is accessible on demand. It is our policy
to invest available cash on hand in short-term, low-risk bank accounts or deposit accounts.

As at 31 December

**2018** 2017
**£m** £m

Cash and cash equivalents 289.0 222.3

4.3 BORROWINGS
Accounting policy
The Group measures all debt instruments (whether financial assets or financial liabilities) initially at fair value, which equates to the
principal value of the consideration paid or received. Subsequent to initial measurement, debt instruments are measured at amortised
cost using the effective interest method. Transaction costs (any such costs incremental and directly attributable to the issue of the
financial instrument) are included in the calculation of the effective interest rate and are amortised over the life of the instrument.

Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that
some or all of the facility will be drawn down. Where this is the case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs.

Debt instruments denominated in foreign currencies are revalued using period end exchange rates, with exchange gains and losses
arising recognised as a component of net interest charges in the period they arise. The Group hedges foreign currency risk in
accordance with the policy set out in note 7.1. Where hedging instruments are used to fix cash flows associated with debt instruments,
the debt instrument and the hedging instrument are measured and presented separately on the balance sheet.

Post-balance sheet events
On 16 October 2018, the Group entered into a £725 million acquisition bridge facility (the Facility) to finance the acquisition of
ScottishPower Generation Limited (see note 5.1). The Group incurred £3.8 million of costs establishing the Facility during the year,
which were deferred on the balance sheet at 31 December 2018.

On 2 January 2019, the Group settled the initial consideration due in respect of the acquisition of £687 million, which was part-funded
by £550 million drawn from the Facility. The balance of the consideration was funded from existing cash reserves.

Borrowings at 31 December 622.9 (14.8) 608.1

On 26 April 2018, the Group issued USD $300 million loan notes listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. The notes have a fixed interest
rate of 6.625% and mature in 2025. The proceeds of the issue were used to repay £200 million floating rate loan notes issued in 2017.
Costs associated with the repayment of these loan notes have been classified as exceptional.

The purpose of the new loan notes is to extend the maturity date of the Group’s senior debt and reduce exposure to interest rate volatility.

The Group has taken out a cross-currency interest rate swap (see note 7.1) to hedge the sterling cash flows associated with the USD
loan notes. In addition to fixing the sterling value of interest payments over a five year period, this instrument fixes the sterling
repayment of principal at £213.3 million in 2023, the impact of which would reduce borrowings by £22.0 million.

The $25 million revolving 30 day facility remains available to the Group, but was undrawn at 31 December 2018.

In addition to the $300 million USD loan notes issued in 2018, the Group’s financing structure also includes £350 million of 4.25% fixed
rate notes and a £350 million Senior Facility comprised of a £315 million revolving credit facility (RCF) and an index-linked term loan of
£35 million.

The RCF matures in April 2021, with an option to extend by one year, and has a margin of 150 basis points over LIBOR. At 31 December
2018, the RCF had been utilised to draw down letters of credit with a total value of £31.8 million (2017: £35.7 million).

The Group had two facilities available but undrawn at 31 December 2018:

- £725 million acquisition bridge facility, subsequently part-drawn on 2 January 2019 (as described above); and

- USD $25 million 30-day revolving facility.

The Group has no other undrawn debt facilities, although it has access to certain non-recourse trade receivable finance facilities and
payment facilities, as described in note 4.4, which are utilised to accelerate working capital cash inflows and defer cash outflows.

of the Group’s subsidiaries, with the exception of the US subsidiary’s land and buildings.

In addition, the Group has a secured commodity trading line, which allows it to transact prescribed volumes of commodity trades
without the requirement to post collateral and FX trading lines with certain banks. Counterparties to these arrangements are entitled
to share in the security as described above. As at 31 December 2018, this value was £11.9 million (2017: £3.6 million).

Note:
(1) During 2016 we closed out a number of in-the-money forward foreign currency purchase contracts with a total value of £14 million. As these contracts were designated into hedge
accounting relationships under IFRS 9, the benefit is being recognised in the income statement when the hedged transaction occurs.
(2) The prior year has been restated due to the initial application of IFRS 9 (see note 8.3).

The B2B Energy Supply business has access to a facility which enables it to accelerate cash flows associated with trade receivables
on a non-recourse basis, which generated a net cash inflow of £24 million in the year ended 31 December 2018, reflected as a
reduction in receivables in the table above (2017: inflow of £34 million). The facility terms were amended during the year, increasing
the facility size to £150 million and bringing more of the receivables balance into its scope, further improving the Group’s overall
liquidity and risk profile.

Cash from ROCs is typically realised several months after the ROC is earned; however, through standard ROC sales and purchase
arrangements we are able to accelerate cash flows over a proportion of these assets. The net impact of ROC purchases and sales on
operating cash flows was a £10.5 million outflow (2017: £161.0 million inflow). We also have access to facilities enabling us to sell ROC
trade receivables on a non-recourse basis. These facilities were unused at the period end (2017: £Nil).

The Group entered into a number of payment facilities in 2018 to leverage scale and efficiencies in transaction processing,
whilst providing a working capital benefit for the Group, for which £87.0 million was outstanding at 31 December 2018 (2017: £Nil).
The amounts fall due between 4 and 60 days from the end of the year.

The Group has sought to normalise payment across its supplier base resulting in certain suppliers extending payment terms and some
reducing terms. Suppliers are able to access a supply chain finance facility provided by a bank, for which funds can be accelerated in
advance of the normal payment terms. The facility does not affect our working capital, as payment terms remain unaltered with the
Group. At 31 December 2018, amounts utilised were not material.

4.5 EQUITY AND RESERVES
Our ordinary share capital reflects the total number of shares in issue, which are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange.

Accounting policy
Ordinary shares are classified as equity as evidenced by their residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting its
liabilities. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax,
from the proceeds.

The Company has only one class of shares, which are ordinary shares of 11 [16]⁄29 pence each, carrying no right to fixed income.
No shareholders have waived their rights to dividends.

Shares issued under employee share schemes
Throughout January to December 2018, a total of 158,739 shares were issued in satisfaction of options vesting in accordance with the
rules of the Group’s Savings-Related Share Option Plan. Of the shares issued, 42,874 were issued to individuals who have left the Group
where discretion was used to vest the shares.

Share buy-back programme
On 20 April 2018, the Group announced the commencement of a £50.0 million share buy-back programme. As at 31 December 2018,
the Group had repurchased 13.0 million ordinary shares as part of the programme at a total cost, including transaction costs, of £47.1
million. These shares are held in a separate Treasury Share reserve awaiting reissue or cancellation and have no voting rights attached
to them.

Subsequent to the year end, on 21 January 2019, the buy-back programme concluded. In total, the Group purchased 13.8 million shares
for total consideration of £50.4 million, including transaction costs.

This section provides information on the assets and liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheet that are not covered in other sections,
including goodwill, other intangible assets and provisions.

5.1 ACQUISITIONS
Accounting policy
Acquisitions of businesses are recognised at the point the Group obtains control of the target (the acquisition date). The consideration
transferred and the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are measured at their fair value on the acquisition date. The
assets and liabilities are recognised in the Consolidated balance sheet and the revenues and profit or loss of the acquired business are
recognised in the Consolidated income statement from the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income
statement in the period the acquisition occurs as an exceptional item. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the
consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.

Acquisition of ScottishPower Generation Limited
The Group announced the proposed acquisition of ScottishPower Generation Limited from Iberdrola on 16 October 2018. The acquisition
was approved by shareholders on 21 December 2018 and subsequently completed at 23:59 on 31 December 2018.

ScottishPower Generation Limited was renamed Drax Generation Enterprise Limited (DGE) on 9 January 2019.

DGE owns and operates a portfolio of hydro, pumped storage and gas-fired power generation assets, including Cruachan Power
Station, one of only four pumped storage assets in the UK, run-of-river hydro schemes in Lanark and Galloway, and gas-fired Combined
Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) power stations at Damhead Creek, Rye House and Shoreham in the south of England, and Blackburn Mill in
the north. DGE also owns SMW Ltd, a company operating a biomass-from-waste facility on the outskirts of Glasgow.

The new sites are complementary to the Group’s existing generation activities, diversifying the Drax portfolio and widening the Group’s
UK footprint. The expanded portfolio of assets ensures the Group can support a power system with increasing intermittent renewable
capacity by providing flexible generation and system support.

The acquired assets are expected to make a positive contributions to both Adjusted EBITDA and cash flows from 2019, as set out in
the shareholder Circular recommending the acquisition, on 5 December 2018, and in the profit forecast referenced on page 41 of this
Annual report.

The purchase consideration was £702 million, payable entirely in cash, subject to working capital adjustments customary for a
transaction of this type. In addition, following the suspension of the UK Capacity Market on 15 November 2018, the Group announced
it had agreed a risk-sharing mechanism with the vendor which will activate in the event the Group does not receive 100% of the
contracted Capacity Market payments for the acquired assets in the period 1 January to 30 September 2019.

If 100% of Capacity Market payments are not received in this period, a further payment will be made either by the Group or by the
vendor, the value and beneficiary of which is contingent upon the 2019 gross profit achieved by the acquired assets. The value of
[any further payment for both parties is capped at £26 million. Full details are set out on the Group’s website. (www.drax.com/cmrisk).](http://www.drax.com/cmrisk)
In the event Capacity Market payments remain suspended beyond 2019, the Group will be entitled to no further compensation.

Reflecting the Group’s belief that the Capacity Market is likely to be reinstated during 2019, no value has been ascribed to the
risk‑sharing mechanism in determining the fair value of the consideration payable on the acquisition date.

In the event the Capacity Market restarts and the Group receives payments relating to the period following the Capacity Market
suspension but prior to the acquisition date (1 October to 31 December 2018), these payments will be passed directly to the vendor and
accordingly no amounts are recorded in the provisional fair values shown below.

The total consideration, after adjusting for estimated working capital values, was £687 million. The consideration remains provisional
and is subject to a completion accounts process.

The consideration was paid on 2 January 2019, funded by a combination of existing cash reserves (£137 million) and the partial drawing
of a £725 million acquisition bridge facility (£550 million). The Group expects to conclude a refinancing of the bridge facility during
2019, as described in note 4.3.

Acquisition-related costs, including stamp duty and advisers fees, amounted to £18.4 million and have been recognised in 2018.
The Group incurred a further £2.6 million of costs in 2018 on activities to ensure operational readiness and initial integration activities
at completion. The total costs of £21.0 million are reported as exceptional items and included in the acquisition and restructuring line
in the income statement.


-----

5.1 ACQUISITIONS continued
The provisional fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired are set out in the table below:

£m

Property, plant and equipment 690.0

Financial assets 40.7

Financial liabilities (41.0)

Pension surplus 3.8

Provisions (13.5)

Intangible assets 0.6

Deferred tax liability (68.5)

Total identifiable net assets **612.1**

Goodwill 74.8

Fair value of consideration payable **686.9**

Due to the acquisition completing at 23:59 on 31 December, there were no amounts recognised in the income statement in respect
of the acquisition, other than the transaction and integration costs described above.

Provisional goodwill of £74.8 million is largely reflective of the trading and operational opportunities that arise from acquiring a
multi-site multi-fuel generation portfolio together with the assembled skilled workforce. None of the goodwill is expected to be
deductible for tax purposes. Intangible assets reflect software previously recognised on the balance sheet of the acquiree.

The financial assets acquired include £35.8 million of receivables, the majority of which reflect trade receivables for ancillary services
and balancing market activity. By virtue of their short tenor, the fair value of these receivables is considered to be the contractual
amounts receivable less any provision for doubtful debts. The provision for doubtful debts as at the acquisition date was less than
£0.1 million. Financial assets includes a net balance of £3.5 million in respect of amounts payable to and receivable from the vendor
and its fellow group undertakings. The Group received an initial settlement in respect of these balances on 2 January 2019, which will
be finalised as part of the completion accounts process.

Additional financial information
The consolidated results of the Group, assuming DGE had been acquired at the beginning of the year, would show Total revenue of
£4,780.0 million (compared to reported Total revenue of £4,229.0 million) and a Total profit after taxation of £43.2 million (compared
to the reported Total profit after taxation of £20.2 million). This information includes the revenue and profits made by DGE and its
subsidiary undertaking between 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2018, extracted from the historical financial records of the acquired
companies. Profit centre analysis was used to exclude the historic results and restructuring activities relating to assets not acquired
by the Group; however no adjustment has been made for the alignment of accounting policies nor the impact of measuring acquired
assets and liabilities at fair value. This information is not necessarily indicative of the results of the combined Group that would have
been achieved had the acquisition actually occurred on 1 January 2018, nor is it indicative of the future results of the combined Group.

5.2 GOODWILL
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of a business when the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the assets acquired.

Accounting policy
Goodwill is initially recognised and measured at the acquisition date. Goodwill is not amortised but reviewed for impairment at least
annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the CGU to which it relates and the recoverable amount for
that CGU assessed. The table below shows movements and balances:

## SECTION 5: OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES continued

5.2 GOODWILL continued
In addition, the Group recognised £74.8 million of provisional goodwill in respect of the ScottishPower transaction in 2018 (see note
5.1). Reflecting the timing of the acquisition, none of the provisional goodwill has been allocated to individual CGUs. This will be
completed during 2019.

Impairment review
The recoverable amount of the Haven Power and Opus Energy CGUs is measured annually, based on a value-in-use calculation using
the Group’s established planning model. This model depends on a broad range of assumptions, the most significant of which are
customer margins and supply volumes. Inherent in these assumptions are expectations about future energy prices and supply costs.
Cash flows beyond the business plan period are inflated into perpetuity using a growth rate of 1%.

The carrying amount of the Haven Power CGU at 31 December 2018 was £40 million. The expected future cash flows of the CGU were
discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 8.1% (calculated based on independent analysis commissioned by the Group, adjusted to
the specific circumstances and risk factors affecting the Group’s B2B Energy Supply business). We believe that this rate reflects the
prospects for a well-established B2B Energy Supply business. The value in use of the Haven Power CGU, including the goodwill, was
significantly in excess of its carrying amount.

The carrying amount of the Opus Energy CGU at 31 December 2018 was £342 million, including intangible assets of £162 million.
Following further integration of Opus Energy into the Group’s existing B2B Energy Supply business during 2018, the discount rate was
assessed as being in line with that of Haven Power at 8.1%. The value in use of the Opus Energy CGU, including the goodwill and
intangible assets, was significantly in excess of its carrying amount. Reflecting the recent acquisition of Opus, the recoverable amount
of the Opus CGU was tested using a range of discount rates up to the rate used in the acquisition valuation of intangible assets in 2017
(10.7%) – application of discount rates across the 8.1% to 10.7% range would not result in an impairment charge.

The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis of the estimates of future cash flows of each CGU. This analysis indicates that any
reasonably possible change in the key assumptions, which are customer margins and supply volumes, would not cause an impairment
loss in respect of goodwill.

5.3 INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets are not physical in nature but are identifiable and separable from other assets. Intangible assets can be acquired in
business combinations (such as the acquisition of Opus Energy during 2017) or purchased separately. The Group routinely purchases
computer software and carbon emissions allowances, which are considered intangible assets.

Accounting policy
Intangibles acquired in business combinations are measured at fair value on the acquisition date. Other intangible assets are measured
at cost. Cost comprises the purchase price (net of any discount or rebate) and any directly attributable costs to bring the asset into the
condition and location required for use as intended by management.

Intangible assets are amortised over their anticipated useful lives. Useful lives are reviewed at each balance sheet date. No changes
to useful lives were made as at 31 December 2018. Amortisation calculations are specific to each category of assets and are explained
in further detail below.

Carrying amounts are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. The customer-related assets and brand are
attributed to the Opus Energy CGU and details of the impairment test relating to this CGU are included in note 5.2.

Customer-related assets
Customer-related assets reflect the value of customer contracts acquired on the acquisition of Opus Energy in February 2017, which
provided the Group with access to a broad customer base with contracted cash flows. The asset valuation of £211 million reflected the
estimated value of the future cash flows associated with this customer base at the acquisition date and is dependent upon estimates
of both current and expected future contract margins and assumed customer retention rates. The cash flows have been discounted
using a pre-tax discount rate of 10.7%. The asset has an estimated useful life of 11 years, calculated based on customer churn-rate
analysis, and is being amortised on a reducing balance basis to reflect the diminishing rate of contract renewals over time.

Opus Energy brand
The Opus Energy brand was acquired as part of the acquisition in February 2017 and valued at £11 million on a relief-from-royalty
method. The brand is being amortised on a straight-line basis over its assumed 10 year useful life.

Computer software
Additions in the period include assets acquired in the Opus Energy acquisition in addition to those in the ordinary course of business,
which principally reflect ongoing investment in business systems to support the B2B Energy Supply segment. Software assets are
amortised on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from three to five years.

As at 31 December 2018, computer software assets in the course of construction amounted to £24.5 million (2017: £11.1 million).

Development assets
The development assets arose on the acquisition of four Open Cycle Gas Turbine projects in December 2016 and reflect the value
of planning and consents. Until operations commence, the assets are considered to have an indefinite life and thus are not amortised
and are subject to impairment testing at each balance sheet date.

At 31 December 2018, the recoverable amount of the development assets was established using a value-in-use calculation derived
from the Group’s established planning model. The assessment reflected the Group’s core planning assumption that the Capacity
Market will be reinstated during 2019 and incorporated assumptions related to likely Capacity Market clearing prices, construction
costs, the ongoing revenues to be derived from the projects once constructed and the direct costs of generating those revenues.


-----

## SECTION 5: OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES continued

5.3 INTANGIBLE ASSETS continued
The expected future cash flows were discounted using a pre-tax rate of 9.1%, which includes an assessment of the level of
construction and execution risk inherent in the existing assets and quality of revenue if constructed. The analysis indicated a
recoverable amount in excess of the current carrying amount of the development assets.

The analysis is sensitive to the discount rate applied. Increasing the pre-tax discount rate by approximately 1% would result in a
recoverable amount below the current carrying value. In the event costs materially increase, or expected future revenue streams
reduce from current estimates, the Group may not proceed with the projects and the assets currently recognised on the balance sheet
would be impaired. In particular, the analysis depends upon achieving an acceptable clearing price in future Capacity Market auctions
(or equivalent income if the Capacity Market is not reinstated in its previous form).

Carbon assets
Carbon assets arise on the purchase of CO2 emissions allowances in excess of the amount allocated under the Emissions Trading
Scheme and required for the current financial year, and are measured at cost, net of any impairment. Given their short tenor, carbon
assets are not amortised. In the event of the UK exiting the EU without a deal, these allowances may no longer be required, as noted
in the risks and viability statements on pages 42 to 49.

The charge to the income statement, within fuel costs, reflects the cost of emissions allowances required to satisfy the obligation for
the current year and takes into account generation and market purchases allocated to the current financial year, and to the extent
further purchases are required, is based on the market price at the balance sheet date.

5.4 PROVISIONS
We make provision for reinstatement to cover the estimated costs of decommissioning and demolishing our generation assets
and remediating the sites at the end of the useful economic lives of the assets.

Accounting policy
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable
that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

Specifically, provision is made for the estimated decommissioning costs at the end of the useful economic life of the Group’s generating
assets, when a legal or constructive obligation arises, on a discounted basis. The amount provided is calculated on a site-by-site basis
and represents the present value of the expected costs. In view of the uncertainty of assessing the amount of any proceeds from
the disposal of the assets at the decommissioning date, no reduction in the provision is made for any such proceeds. The discount
rate used is a risk-free pre-tax rate that reflects the duration of the liability. The average discount rate used across the Group’s
decommissioning provisions is 1.8% (2017: 1.8%). The use of a risk-free rate reflects the fact that the estimated future cash flows
have built-in risks specific to the liability. An amount equivalent to the discounted provision is capitalised within property, plant and
equipment and is depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets. The unwinding of the discount is included in interest payable
and similar charges.

Other provisions include a small provision in respect of dilapidation provisions for leased offices and other provisions recognised as part
of the acquisition of ScottishPower Generation Limited (see note 5.1).

Decommissioning provisions are made in respect of the Group’s thermal generating plants (Drax Power Station and CCGT power
stations). The decommissioning provision is based on the assumption that the decommissioning and reinstatement will take place
at the end of the expected useful life of each site (which varies between 2026 and 2039) and has been estimated using existing
technology at current prices based on independent third-party advice, updated on a triennial basis. The most recent updates took
place in December 2017 for Drax Power Station, and 2018 for other sites.

## SECTION 6: OUR PEOPLE

The notes in this section relate to the remuneration of our directors and employees, including our obligations under retirement
benefit schemes.

6.1 EMPLOYEES AND DIRECTORS
This note provides a more detailed breakdown of the cost of our employees, including executive directors. The average number of
employees in Operations (staff based at production sites), B2B Energy Supply services (employees in our B2B Energy Supply segment)
and Central and administrative functions are also provided.

Further information in relation to pay and remuneration of the executive directors can be found in the report of the Remuneration
Committee, starting on page 75.

The Group acquired ScottishPower on the last day of the reporting period and as such no ScottishPower employee data has been
included. The number of ScottishPower staff joining the Group as a result of the acquisition is 252.

6.2 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
We operate two share option schemes for our employees; the Performance Share Plan (PSP) for directors and senior executives (which
replaced the Bonus Matching Plan (BMP) from 2017) and incorporates the Deferred Share Plan (DSP); and the Savings-Related Share
Option Plan (SAYE) for all qualifying employees. We incur a non-cash charge in respect of these schemes in our income statement,
which is set out below along with a detailed description of each scheme and the number of options outstanding.

Accounting policy
The PSP, BMP, DSP and SAYE share-based payments are equity settled. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at the
fair value of the equity instrument at the date of grant and are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the
relevant vesting period, based on an estimate of the shares that will ultimately vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based
vesting conditions, which is revised at each balance sheet date.

Share Incentive Plan (SIP)
Between 2008 and 2010, qualifying employees could buy up to £1,500 worth of Partnership Shares in any one tax year. Matching
shares were awarded to employees to match any shares they bought, in a ratio of one-to-one, with the cost of matching shares borne
by the Group. There have been no awards under the SIP Partnership and Matching Share plan since 2010.

Performance Share Plan (PSP)
The PSP was introduced for directors and senior executives to replace the Bonus Matching Plan. Under the PSP, annual awards of
performance and service-related shares are made for no consideration to executive directors and other senior executives up to a
maximum of 175% of their annual bonus. Vesting of a proportion of shares is conditional upon whether the Group’s Total Shareholder
Return (TSR) matches or outperforms an index (determined in accordance with the scheme rules) over three years and vesting of a
proportion of shares is conditional upon performance against the internal balanced corporate scorecard. 50% of the PSP options
granted in 2018 will vest conditional on Group TSR relative to the TSR of a comparator group of companies, with the remaining 50%
vesting conditional upon the internal balanced corporate scorecard.

The fair value of the 2018 PSP awards of £2.5 million (2017: £2.8 million) is being charged to the income statement on a straight-line
basis over the three-year vesting period. The fair value of PSP awards is calculated using a Monte-Carlo valuation model, which takes
into account the estimated probability of different levels of vesting. The key inputs to the valuation model for the 2018 awards are the
share price at the grant date of 272 pence (2017: 325 pence), expected volatility of 41% (2017: 44%), and risk-free interest rate of 0.83%
(2017: 0.13%).

Movements in the number of shares outstanding for the PSP awards are as follows:

**2018** 2017

The weighted average fair value of the options granted during the year was 160 pence (2017: 177 pence).

All of the PSP options outstanding at the end of the period had an exercise price of £nil (2017: £nil). The weighted average remaining
contractual life was 22 months (2017: 28 months).

The number of options exercisable at the year end was nil (2017: nil).


-----

6.2 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS continued
Deferred Share Plan (DSP)
In addition, the Group operates the DSP, which was introduced as a vehicle for deferring 35% of the annual bonus of executive
directors. DSP awards are granted at nil cost and vest after three years subject to continued employment or “good leaver” termination
provisions. The share price on the grant date of DSP awards made in 2018 was 272 pence (2017: 325 pence) and the fair value of
these awards of £0.4 million (2017: £0.6 million) is being charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the three-year
vesting period.

The fair value of DSP awards is calculated using a Monte-Carlo valuation model, which takes into account the estimated probability
of different levels of vesting. The key inputs to the valuation model for the 2018 awards are the share price at date of grant, expected
volatility of 41% (2017: 44%), and risk-free interest rate of 0.83% (2017: 0.13%).

Movements in the number of share options outstanding for the DSP awards are as follows:

50% of the DSP options granted in 2018 will vest in three years conditional on Group TSR relative to the TSR of a comparator group of
companies, with the remaining 50% vesting conditional upon the internal balanced corporate scorecard.

Bonus Matching Plan (BMP)
Under the BMP, annual awards of performance and service-related shares were made for no consideration to executive directors and
other senior executives up to a maximum of 150% of their annual bonus up until 2016. The BMP was replaced in 2017 by the PSP. For
awards prior to 2017, a proportion of the shares vesting under the BMP are conditional upon whether the Group’s Total Shareholder
Return (TSR) matches or outperforms an index (determined in accordance with the scheme rules) over three years and a proportion
of the shares vesting is conditional upon performance against the internal balanced corporate scorecard. The fair value of the 2017
and 2016 BMP awards, £0.6 million and £2.6 million respectively, are being charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis
over the corresponding three-year vesting periods.

The fair value of BMP awards is calculated using a Monte-Carlo valuation model, which takes into account the estimated probability
of different levels of vesting. No BMP awards were made in 2018.

Savings-Related Share Option Plan (SAYE)
In March 2018, participation in the SAYE plan was offered again to all qualifying employees. Options were granted for employees to
acquire shares at a price of 211 pence (2017: 280 pence), representing a discount of 20% to the prevailing market price determined in
accordance with the scheme rules. The options are exercisable at the end of three or five-year savings contracts. The fair value of the
options granted in connection with the SAYE plan of £1.2 million (2017: £0.9 million) is being charged to the income statement over the
term of the relevant contracts.

The fair value of SAYE awards is calculated using a Black-Scholes model, which compares exercise price to share price at the date
of grant.

The fair value of SAYE options granted and the inputs to the option pricing model used in the current and previous year are set out
in the table below:

Grant date **28 March 2018 28 March 2018 27 March 2017** 27 March 2017

Share price at grant date (pence) 275 275 328 328

Vesting period 3 years 5 years 3 years 5 years

Exercise price (pence) 211 211 280 280

Dividend yield 5.1% 3.0% 1.8% 2.5%

Annual risk-free interest rate 1.22% 1.35% 0.73% 0.90%

Expected volatility 40.9% 38.1% 41.2% 37.3%

Fair value of options granted (pence) 80 94 106 103

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous three and five
years respectively. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects
of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

For the SAYE options exercised during the period, the weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 365 pence
(2017: 305 pence).

The weighted average exercise price of SAYE options outstanding at the end of the period was 212 pence (2017: 224 pence).
The weighted average remaining contractual life was 16 months (2017: 22 months).

The number of options exercisable at the year-end was 2,252 (2017: nil).

Additional information in relation to the Group’s share-based incentive plans is included in the Remuneration Committee report
on page 75.

6.3 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS
The Group operates one defined benefit and four defined contribution pension schemes.

The Drax Power Group (DPG) section of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme (ESPS) is a defined benefit scheme: a pension
arrangement under which participating members receive a pension benefit at retirement determined by the scheme rules. Members
are typically entitled to an annual pension on retirement of 1/80th of final pensionable salary for each year of service plus a tax-free
lump sum of three times pension.

The Drax Group Personal Pension Plan, Haven Power Personal Pension Plan, Opus Energy Group Personal Pension Plan and Drax
Biomass Inc. 401(K) Plan are defined contribution schemes, which provide a retirement benefit that is dependent upon actual
contributions made by the Group and members of the relevant scheme.

As part of the acquisition of Drax Generation Enterprise Limited (see note 5.1), employees with defined benefit pension rights were
transferred to the Group. These employees continue to participate in the Scottish Power Pension Scheme whilst the Group is in the
process of setting up a new scheme (the Drax 2019 Scheme) for the members to transfer into.

Accounting policy
Payments to defined contribution schemes are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered services that entitle them
to the contributions. The income statement charge for the defined contribution scheme represents the contributions due to be paid
by the Group in respect of the current period.

For the defined benefit pension scheme, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with
actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each reporting period. Remeasurement of the obligation, comprising actuarial gains
and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on scheme assets (excluding interest), is recognised immediately
in the balance sheet with a charge or credit to the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which it occurs. Defined
benefit costs, including current service costs, past service costs and gains and losses on curtailments and settlements are recognised
in the income statement as part of operating and administrative expenses in the period in which they occur. The net interest expense
is recognised in finance costs.

Significant estimation uncertainty
Measurement of the defined benefit obligation using the projected unit credit method involves the use of key assumptions, including
discount rates, inflation rates, salary and pension increases and mortality rates. These actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually
and modified as appropriate. The Group believes that the assumptions utilised in measuring obligations under the scheme are
reasonable based on prior experience, market conditions and the advice of scheme actuaries. However, actual results may differ from
such assumptions.

The assumptions applied in 2018 have been prepared on a consistent basis with those in the previous period and in accordance with
independent actuarial advice received.

Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates four defined contribution schemes, the Drax Group Personal Pension Plan, Haven Power Personal Pension Plan,
Opus Energy Group Personal Pension Plan and Drax Biomass Inc. 401(K) Plan, for all qualifying employees. Pension costs for the
defined contribution schemes are as follows:

Years ended 31 December

**2018** 2017
**£m** £m

Total included in staff costs 8.1 8.1

As at 31 December 2018, contributions of £1.1 million (2017: £nil) due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over
to the schemes. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.

Defined benefit schemes
The breakdown of the defined benefit pension surplus is as follows:

As at 31 December

**2018** 2017
**£m** £m

Drax Power Group section of ESPS – net surplus/(liability) 18.9 (1.2)

Drax 2019 Scheme – net surplus 3.8 –

Total net surplus/(liability) recognised in the balance sheet 22.7 (1.2)

During 2018, application of the accounting assumptions used in relation to the Drax Power Group of the ESPS, which are described in
further detail below, resulted in the scheme moving into a position of surplus assets over liabilities. The scheme rules allow the Group
to benefit from any residual surplus upon winding up of the scheme. As a result, the surplus has been recognised in the balance sheet
in full.

Drax Power Group (DPG) section of ESPS
The DPG section of the ESPS was closed to new members as of 1 January 2002 unless they qualify through being existing members
of another part of the ESPS. Members who joined before this date continue to build up pension benefits as part of the scheme.

The DPG ESPS exposes the Group to actuarial and other risks, the most significant of which are considered to be:

Investment risk The scheme liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if assets
underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. The scheme holds a significant proportion of growth assets
(diversified growth funds, direct lending and absolute return bonds) which, though expected to outperform
corporate bonds in the long term, create volatility and risk in the short term. The allocation to growth assets
is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the scheme’s long-term objectives.

Discount rate risk A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed upon the scheme’s liabilities, although this
will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the scheme’s bond holdings.

Longevity risk The majority of the scheme’s obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life
expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities of the scheme.

Inflation risk The majority of the scheme’s obligations to pay benefits are linked to inflation and, as such, higher inflation will
lead to higher liabilities. The majority of the assets held by the scheme are either unaffected by or only loosely
correlated with inflation, such that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit. In most cases, caps on
inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation. The scheme has a significant holding
in liability-driven investments and a substantial proportion of this risk is hedged.

Other risks include operational risks (such as paying out the wrong benefits), legislative risks (such as the Government increasing the
burden on pension schemes through new legislation) and other demographic risks (such as making a higher proportion of members
with dependants eligible to receive pensions from the Group). The Trustees ensure certain benefits payable on death before retirement.

The most recent funding valuation of the DPG ESPS was carried out by Aon Hewitt, a qualified independent actuary, as at 31 March 2016.
The actuarial review at 31 December 2018 is based on the same membership and other data as this funding valuation. The scheme
board accepted the advice of the actuary and approved the use of these assumptions for the purpose of assessing the scheme cost.
Future valuations are required by law at intervals of no more than three years.

The results of the latest funding valuation at 31 March 2016 have been adjusted to the balance sheet date, taking into account
experience over the period since 31 March 2016, changes in market conditions and differences in financial and demographic assumptions.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation and the related current service costs were measured using the projected unit credit
method. The principal assumptions used, which reflect the nature and term of the scheme liabilities, are as follows:

As at 31 December

**2018** 2017
**% p.a.** % p.a.

Discount rate 3.0 2.6

Inflation (RPI) 3.2 3.2

Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.1 3.0

Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.8 3.8


-----

6.3 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS continued
Mortality assumptions are based on recent actual mortality experience of scheme members and allow for expected future
improvements in mortality rates. The assumptions are that a member aged 60 in 2018 will live, on average, for a further 26 years if they
are male (2017: 26 years) and for a further 29 years if they are female (2017: 29 years). Life expectancy at age 60 for male and female
non-pensioners currently aged 45 is assumed to be 27 and 30 years respectively (2017: 27 and 30 years respectively).

The net surplus recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the DPG section of the ESPS is the excess of the fair value of the plan
assets over the present value of the defined benefit obligation, determined as follows:

As at 31 December

**2018** 2017
**£m** £m

Defined benefit obligation (275.6) (306.5)

Fair value of plan assets 294.5 305.3

Net surplus/(liability) recognised in the balance sheet 18.9 (1.2)

The amounts recognised in the income statement, within other operating and administrative expenses and finance costs,
are as follows:

Years ended 31 December

Past service cost 0.6 –

Included in finance costs (note 2.5):

Total amounts recognised in the income statement 7.3 7.8

On 26 October 2018, the High Court issued a judgement confirming that defined benefit schemes should be amended to equalise
benefits in relation to guaranteed minimum pensions (GMP) for men and women. It is not yet agreed how benefits will be equalised
in practice; however, on the grounds that implementation will not lead to any further obligations, the Group’s actuarial advisers have
initially estimated that the liabilities of the scheme will increase by £0.6m as at the date of the court ruling. This has been reflected as
a past service cost in 2018.

Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in full, as follows:

Years ended 31 December

6.3 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS continued
The actuarial gains of £23.0 million (2017: £4.8 million) reflect gains of £21.8 million arising from changes in financial assumptions
(2017: gains of £5.5 million) and £1.8 million gains arising from changes in demographic assumptions (2017: losses of £4.5 million)
offset by losses arising from scheme experience of £0.6 million (2017: gains of £3.8 million).

The gains due to changes in financial assumptions principally reflect the decrease in the present value of the scheme liabilities arising
as a result of the change in discount rate assumption to 3.0% (2017: 2.6%) following increases in corporate bond yields.

Changes in the fair value of plan assets are as follows:

Years ended 31 December

**2018** 2017
**£m** £m

Fair value of plan assets at 1 January 305.3 281.3

Employee contributions 0.1 0.1

Benefits paid (23.2) (16.0)

Fair value of plan assets at 31 December 294.5 305.3

Employer contributions included payments totalling £5.0 million (2017: £7.5 million) to reduce the actuarial deficit. There were no
contributions outstanding at the end of the year (2017: £0.8 million).

The actual return on plan assets in the period was £0.8 million (2017: £24.5 million).

The fair values of the major categories of plan assets were as follows:

As at 31 December

**2018** 2017
**£m** £m

Gilts 83.6 104.1

Equities[(1)] 9.8 76.6

Property 34.8 32.2

Investment funds 40.4 –

Cash and other assets[(3)] 75.7 20.8

Fair value of total plan assets 294.5 305.3

Notes:
(1) At 31 December 2018 the scheme’s long-term asset strategy was: diversified growth funds (35%), direct lending (5%), absolute return bonds (7%), corporate bonds (8%), liability driven
investing (29%), long lease property (12%), and cash (5%)
(2) Fixed interest bonds include a mixture of corporate, Government and absolute return bonds. Approximately 10% of the bonds have a sub-investment grade credit rating (i.e. BB+ or lower)
(3) Other assets include £15.5 million of investments in direct lending, a type of private equity vehicle, which is not quoted in an active market (2017: £17.9 million)

The pension plan assets do not include any ordinary shares issued by Drax Group plc or any property occupied by the Group.

The Group employs a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return on pension plan assets. Historical markets
are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market
principles. The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return for each asset class
relative to the actual asset allocation for the scheme.


-----

6.3 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS continued
The assumptions for discount rate, inflation rate, rate of increase in pensions paid and expected return on plan assets all have a
potentially significant effect on the measurement of the scheme surplus. The following table provides an indication of the sensitivity
of the pension surplus at 31 December 2018 to changes in these assumptions:


%


Increase/
(decrease) in
net surplus
£m


Discount rate – Increase 0.25 13.6

– Decrease 0.25 (15.2)

Inflation rate[(1)] – Increase 0.25 (13.1)

– Decrease 0.25 12.3

Life expectancy – Increase 1 year (9.2)

– Decrease 1 year 9.3

Note:
(1) The sensitivity of the scheme liabilities to salary and pension increases is closely correlated with inflation

The Group is exposed to investment and other experience risks, as described above, and may need to make additional contributions
where it is estimated that the benefits will not be met from regular contributions and expected investment income.

The defined benefit obligation includes benefits for current employees of the Group (60%), former employees of the Group who are yet
to retire (5%) and retired pensioners (35%). The weighted-average period over which benefit payments are expected to be made, or the
duration of the scheme liabilities, was assessed at the 31 March 2016 funding valuation to be 21 years.

Future contributions
The Group expects to make regular contributions, in respect of service costs, of £10.1 million to the defined benefit pension plan during
the 12 months ended 31 December 2019.

In addition to regular contributions, deficit contributions have been agreed with the Trustees based upon the Technical Provisions
as at the 31 March 2016 valuation. The Technical Provisions indicate a deficit of £45 million including an estimate of the impact of
future service costs, which do not meet the definition of a liability at 31 December 2018 for inclusion in the financial statements.
This valuation has improved since 31 March 2016, in line with the accounting surplus, although this remains subject to a recovery plan.

The Group has agreed to make additional contributions over the period to 31 December 2025 to eliminate the deficit. At this point the
scheme is expected to be self-sufficient, unless material adverse changes in economic conditions arise compared to those assumed
in the valuation. The Group is confident that the additional contributions are manageable within the Group’s business plan. The terms
of the Trust Deed allow the Group to recover any surplus once the liabilities of the scheme have been settled. Accordingly the deficit
contributions will not give rise to an unrecognised surplus.

Drax 2019 Defined Benefit Scheme
On 31 December 2018, the Group purchased a generation business from ScottishPower (see note 5.1). Under the terms of the sale and
purchase agreement (SPA), a number of employees with defined benefit rights transferred to the Group. The employees in question
continue to participate in the Scottish Power Pension Scheme whilst the Group is in the process of setting up a new scheme for the
members to transfer into (the Drax 2019 Scheme).

The calculations set out below have been performed on the assumption that the transfer of members and assets into the Drax 2019
Scheme occurs during 2019, and will be in accordance with the terms set out in the SPA and the draft Trust Deed regarding the future
operation of the new scheme.

The liabilities and asset values at 31 December 2018 have been calculated based on advice from PwC, an independent qualified actuary.

The liabilities have been calculated using full member by member data as at 16 October 2018, the date of the SPA. The valuation has
been prepared at 31 December 2018 allowing for the accrual of benefits up to the year end date and based on the assumptions set
out below. The valuation includes an allowance for the equalisation of GMP, calculated using an actuarial GMP benefit modelling tool.

The total asset value at 31 December 2018 has been estimated based on a share of funds mechanism agreed with ScottishPower
in the SPA.

6.3 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS continued
Assumptions have been set using the best information currently available to the Group and based on the Group’s expectations of
events during 2019 in order to set up the new pension scheme. In the event that experience in 2019 differs from these estimates,
retrospective adjustments may be required to the extent material.

The principal assumptions have been set with reference to the nature and term of the liabilities acquired and are as follows:

As at 31 December

**2018** 2017
**% p.a.** % p.a.

Discount rate 3.1 –

Inflation (RPI) 3.1 –

Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.0 –

assets to be transferred over the present value of the defined benefit obligation acquired:

As at 31 December

**2018** 2017
**£m** £m

Defined benefit obligation (50.7) –

The draft Trust Deed provides for any residual surplus on winding up of the scheme to be returned to the Group.

The assumptions for discount rate, inflation rate, rate of increase in pensions paid and expected return on plan assets all have a
potentially significant effect on the measurement of the scheme surplus. The following table provides an indication of the sensitivity
of the surplus at 31 December 2018 to changes in these assumptions:

## SECTION 7: RISK MANAGEMENT

This section provides disclosures around financial risk management, including the financial instruments we use to mitigate such risks.

7.1 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk,
liquidity risk, counterparty risk and credit risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability
of commodity and financial markets and seeks to manage potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance.

The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. Risk management is overseen by the risk
management committees as explained in principal risks and uncertainties (page 44) which identify, evaluate and hedge financial
risks in close coordination with the Group’s trading and treasury functions under policies approved by the Board of directors.

Commodity price risk
The Group is exposed to the effect of fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly the price of electricity, gas, the price of coal,
sustainable wood fibre and pellets, other fuels and the price of CO2 emissions allowances. Price variations and market cycles have
historically influenced the financial results of the Group and are expected to continue to do so.

The Group has a policy of securing forward power sales, purchases of fuel and CO2 emissions allowances when profitable to do so and
in line with specified limits under approved policies. All commitments to sell power under fixed price contracts are designated as cash
flow hedges as they reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of electricity.

The Group purchases sustainable biomass, coal and other fuels under either fixed or variable priced contracts with different maturities
principally from a number of international sources. The Group considers all such contracts to be economic hedges. The Group applies
the own use exemption or hedge accounting in accordance with IFRS 9 as set out in the accounting policies in notes 7.2 and 7.4.

Where forward power curves are less liquid, the Group uses financially-settled gas sales as a proxy for power to mitigate the risk of
power price fluctuations. The Group also purchases gas under fixed-price contracts to meet the demand of its B2B Energy Supply
customers and, looking forward following the acquisition of Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) assets at the end of 2018, as a fuel
for its gas-fired generation portfolio.

The Group purchases CO2 emissions allowances under fixed price contracts with different maturity dates from a range of domestic
and international sources. All commitments to purchase CO2 emissions allowances under fixed price contracts are designated as cash
flow hedges as they reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of CO2 emissions allowances.

Commodity price sensitivity
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to commodity prices for outstanding monetary items at the
balance sheet date. The analysis is based on the Group’s commodity financial instruments held at each balance sheet date.

If commodity prices had been 5% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, in the Group’s Total Results:

- profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2018 would increase/decrease by £6.6 million (2017: loss after tax would increase/
decrease by £1.5 million). This is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure to oil derivatives; and

- the hedge reserve would increase/decrease by £18.9 million (2017: increase/decrease by £5.6 million) mainly as a result of the changes
in the fair value of financial coal and power derivatives.

Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to the fluctuations in foreign currency rates resulting from committed and forecast transactions in foreign
currencies, principally in relation to purchases of fuel for use in the Power Generation business. These purchases are typically
denominated in US dollars, Canadian dollars or euros.

In addition, in order to optimise the cost of funding, the Group has issued foreign currency denominated debt in US dollars
(see note 4.3). The Group utilises derivative contracts to manage exchange risk on foreign currency debt.

It is the Group’s policy to hedge material transactional exposures using a variety of derivatives to fix the sterling value of foreign
currency cash flows, except where there is an economic hedge inherent in the transaction. The Group enters into derivative contracts,
including forwards and options, to manage its anticipated foreign currency requirements over a rolling five-year period.

The Group also has a limited exposure to translation risk in relation to its net investment in its US subsidiary, Drax Biomass Inc.

## SECTION 7: RISK MANAGEMENT continued

7.1 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued
Foreign currency sensitivity
If sterling exchange rates had been 5% stronger/weaker against other currencies and all other variables were held constant, in the
Group’s Total Results:

- profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2018 would increase/decrease by £112.3 million/£124.7 million (2017: loss after tax
would decrease/increase by £351.1 million/£285.5 million). This is attributable to the Group’s exposure to foreign currency exchange
contracts entered in relation to fuel purchase contracts; and

- other equity reserves would decrease/increase by £160.6 million/£183.6 million (2017: decrease/increase by £111.1 million/£122.8 million)
as a result of the changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts.

Interest rate risk
The Group has limited exposure to interest rate risk, principally in relation to cash and cash equivalents and floating rate debt
instruments. At December 2018 the Group had no floating rate debt instruments drawn. The Group has taken out a fixed to fixed
cross‑currency interest rate swap to hedge the future cash flows associated with the USD $300 million 2025 fixed rate loan notes,
effectively converting them to sterling fixed rate cash flows.

The return generated on the Group’s cash balance, or on amounts drawn on the revolving credit facility, are also exposed to
movements in short-term interest rates. The Group manages cash balances to protect against adverse changes in rates whilst
retaining liquidity.

Information about the Group’s instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk and their repayment schedules is provided in note 4.3.

Interest rate sensitivity
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for non-derivative instruments at the
balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liability outstanding at the balance
sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.

If interest rates had been 1% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit after tax and net assets for the
year ended 31 December 2018 would decrease/increase by £1.0 million (2017: loss after tax would decrease/increase by £2.2 million)
as a result of the changes in interest payable during the period.

Liquidity risk
The treasury function is responsible for liquidity, funding and settlement management under policies approved by the Board of
directors. Liquidity needs are monitored using regular forecasting of operational cash flows and financing commitments. The Group
maintains a mixture of cash and cash equivalents, committed facilities and uncommitted facilities in order to ensure sufficient funding
for business requirements.

In managing liquidity risk, the Group has the ability to accelerate the cash flows associated with certain working capital items
(principally those related to ROC sales and B2B Energy Supply power sales). In each case this is undertaken on a non-recourse basis
and accordingly the ROCs and other items are derecognised from the balance sheet at the point of sale. As discussed in the financial
review on page 34, the Group also utilises standard purchasing facilities to extend the working capital cycle, whilst still paying suppliers
on time. The impact on the Group’s cash flows is described in note 4.4.

The following tables set out details of the expected contractual maturity of non-derivative financial liabilities. The tables include both
interest and principal cash flows. To the extent that interest flows are floating rate, the undiscounted amount is derived from interest
rate curves at the balance sheet date.

Counterparty risk
As the Group relies on third party suppliers and counterparties for the delivery of currency, sustainable biomass and other goods
and services, it is exposed to the risk of non-performance by these third-party suppliers. If a large supplier were to fall into financial
difficulty and/or fail to deliver against its contract with the Group, there would be additional costs associated with securing the lost
goods or services from other suppliers.

The Group enters into contracts for the sale of electricity to a number of counterparties. The failure of one or more of these
counterparties to perform their contractual obligations may cause the Group financial distress or increase the risk profile of the Group.

## SECTION 7: RISK MANAGEMENT continued

7.1 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued
Credit risk
The Group’s gross exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the balance sheet date,
as summarised below:

As at 31 December

**2018** 2017
**£m** £m

Financial assets:

Cash and cash equivalents 289.0 222.3

Trade and other receivables 413.3 409.3

Other fixed asset investments 2.4 1.3

Derivative financial instruments 510.6 366.2

1,215.3 999.1

Trade and other receivables are stated gross of the provision for doubtful debts of £44.0 million (2017: £28.2 million) and exclude
non-financial receivables such as prepayments.

Of the Group‘s three operating segments, two are exposed to different levels and concentrations of credit risk, largely reflecting the
number, size and nature of their respective customers. The Pellet Production segment only trades intra-group.

The highest risk is in the B2B Energy Supply segment, with a high number of customers of varying sizes operating in a variety of
markets. In particular, Opus Energy carries lower concentrations but higher levels of credit risk owing to a customer base comprised
largely of smaller retail and commercial entities.

In the B2B Energy Supply segment, credit risk is managed by checking a company’s creditworthiness and financial strength both
before commencing trade and during the business relationship. Credit risk is monitored and managed by business sector. In addition
the B2B Energy Supply segment extended its trade credit insurance programme to increase its mitigation to credit risk.

For the Power Generation segment, the risk arises from treasury, trading and energy procurement activities, as well as sale of byproducts from generation activities. Wholesale counterparty credit exposures are monitored by individual counterparty and by
category of credit rating, and are subject to approved limits. The Group uses master netting agreements to reduce credit risk and net
settles payments with counterparties where net settlement provisions exist. In addition, the Group employs a variety of other methods
to mitigate credit risk: margining, various forms of parent company guarantee, deed of charge, cash collateral and letters of credit.
The majority of the Generation business’s credit risk is with counterparties in related energy industries or with financial institutions.
In addition, where deemed appropriate, the Group has historically purchased credit default swaps.

The investment of surplus cash is undertaken with the objective of that there is sufficient liquidity at all times, so that funds are
available to meet liabilities as they fall due, whilst securing a return from invested funds and preserving the capital value of those funds
within Board-approved policies. These policies manage credit risk exposure by setting out minimum rating requirements, maximum
investment with any one counterparty and the maturity profile.

Capital management
The Group manages its capital to ensure it is able to continue as a going concern and maintain its credit rating while maximising
the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of
shareholders’ equity (excluding the hedge and cost of hedging reserves), plus net debt. Net debt is comprised of borrowings disclosed
in note 4.3 and cash and cash equivalents in note 4.2.

7.2 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
We enter into forward contracts for the purchase and sale of physical commodities (principally power, gas, coal, sustainable biomass
and CO2 emissions allowances) to secure market level bark and dark green spreads on future electricity sales, and also financial forward
and option contracts (principally currency exchange contracts and financial coal and oil derivatives) to fix sterling cash flows.

We hold these contracts to manage key risks facing the business, including commodity price risk and foreign currency risk (see note 7.1).

A successful commercial hedging strategy is critical to the Group’s business model. Our policy is to fix exposures to commodity price
movements and changes in foreign exchange rates using derivative contracts such as those described above. This strategy aims to
de-risk the business, providing security and certainty over cash flows into the future. As at 31 December 2018, the fair value of our
forward derivative contracts, consisting largely of forward contracts for the purchase of foreign currencies (principally for the purpose
of fixing the sterling cost of sustainable biomass purchases), increased to £359.0 million (2017: £160.0 million).

Accounting policy
At the balance sheet date all contracts (subject to certain exemptions described below) must be measured at fair value, which is in essence
the difference between the price we have secured in the contract, and the price we could achieve in the market at that point in time.

Changes in fair value are recognised either within the income statement or the hedge reserve, dependent upon whether the contract
in question qualifies as an effective hedge under IFRS (see note 7.4).

Where possible, the Group has taken advantage of the own-use exemption which allows qualifying contracts to be excluded from
fair value mark-to-market accounting. This applies to certain contracts for physical commodities entered into and held for the Group’s
own purchase, sale or usage requirements, including forward contracts for the purchase of biomass, and coal from domestic sources.

Contracts which do not qualify for the own-use exemption – principally power, gas, financial oil, financial coal, CO2 emissions allowances
and forward foreign currency exchange contracts – are accounted for as derivatives in accordance with IFRS 9 and are recorded in
the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in fair value reflected through the hedge reserve (note 7.4) to the extent that the contracts
are designated as effective hedges in accordance with IFRS 9, or the income statement where the hedge accounting requirements are
not met. The Group enters into forward contracts solely for the purpose of financial risk management and considers all of its contracts
to be economic hedges, regardless of whether the specific criteria for hedge accounting are met. To ensure these derivatives are not
reflected in the underlying performance of the Group, they are excluded from the Adjusted Results in the income statement.

Derivative financial instruments with a maturity date within 12 months from the balance sheet date are classified as current assets
or liabilities. Instruments with a maturity date beyond 12 months are classified as non-current assets or liabilities.

The location in the consolidated financial statements of the changes in fair value of derivative contracts in the current and previous
year is summarised in the table below:

## SECTION 7: RISK MANAGEMENT continued

7.2 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued
Significant estimation uncertainty
The fair values of derivative instruments for commodities and foreign currency exchange contracts are determined using forward
price curves. Forward price curves represent the Group’s estimates of the prices at which a buyer or seller could contract today for
delivery or settlement of a commodity or foreign exchange payment or receipt, at future dates. The Group generally bases forward
price curves upon readily obtainable market price quotations, as the Group’s commodity and forward foreign exchange contracts do
not generally extend beyond the actively traded portion of these curves. However, the forward price curves used are only an estimate
of how future prices will move and are, therefore, subjective. Where derivative financial instruments include options these are valued
using an option pricing model. Inputs to the model include market commodity prices, forward price curves, the term of the option,
discount rate and assumptions about volatility based on historical movements. The inputs include assumptions around future
transactions and market movements, as well as credit risk and are, therefore, subjective.

Fair value accounting
Forward contracts for the sale of power, purchase of coal from international sources, purchase of CO2 emissions allowances, financial
coal, financial oil, gas (collectively “Commodity contracts”) and foreign currency exchange contracts are recorded in the balance sheet
at fair value as follows:

**As at 31 December 2018** As at 31 December 2017

**Assets** **Liabilities** Assets Liabilities
**£m** **£m** £m £m

Commodity contracts:

The total increase in the fair value of these contracts of £196.8 million (2017: £365.4 million reduction) is recognised in the income
statement, cost of hedging or the hedge reserve, dependent upon whether the hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9 are met,
as follows:

Years ended 31 December

**2018** 2017

Other movements on derivative contracts recognised in arriving at total operating profit (note 7.4) 27.6 –

Total gains/(losses) on derivative contracts 196.8 (365.4)

The Group maintains a substantial foreign currency hedging programme to secure the sterling cost of future purchases of fuel in
foreign currencies. The vast majority of fuel purchases, and therefore currency exchange contracts, are denominated in US dollars.
The unrealised gains reflect the weakening of sterling against the US dollar in the year.

A material proportion of these contracts are not designated in hedge accounting relationships under IFRS 9 and thus the gains on
these contracts were recognised in the income statement.

Unrealised gains or losses recognised in the hedge reserve principally reflect gains or losses on the portion of forward currency


-----

7.2 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued
Fair value measurement

- Commodity contracts fair value – The fair value of open commodity contracts that do not qualify for the own-use exemption is
calculated by reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date. As contracts are generally short-term, forward market
price curves are available for the duration of the contracts. The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the
current bid price; the quoted price for financial liabilities is the current ask price.

- Forward foreign currency exchange contracts fair value – The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts is
determined using forward currency exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.

- Other financial contracts fair value – The fair value of other financial contracts that do not qualify for the own-use exemption,
is calculated by reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date. As contracts are generally short-term, forward market
price curves are available for the duration of the contracts.

The fair values of all derivative financial instruments are discounted to reflect the credit risk inherent within the instrument.

The Group has reviewed all significant contracts for the presence of embedded derivatives. Where contracts were found to contain
embedded derivatives, they were considered to be closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract,
and therefore do not require separate valuation from their host contracts.

IFRS requires categorisation of our financial instruments in accordance with the following hierarchy in order to explain the basis on
which their fair values have been determined:

- Level 1 – fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities;

- Level 2 – fair value measurements are those derived from inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable
for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and

- Level 3 – fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are
not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

Categorisation within this fair value measurement hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is
significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset or liability.

The fair value of commodity contracts and forward foreign currency exchange contracts are largely determined by comparison
between forward market prices and the contract price; therefore, these contracts are categorised as Level 2.

There have been no transfers during the year between Level 1, 2 or 3 category inputs.

7.3 OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group hold a variety of other non-derivative financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, payables and
receivables arising from operations.

Fair value
Cash and cash equivalents (note 4.2), trade and other receivables (note 3.5) and trade and other payables (note 3.7) generally have
a short time to maturity. For this reason their carrying values, on the historical cost basis, approximate to their fair value. The Group’s
borrowings relate principally to the publicly traded high-yield loan notes and amounts drawn against term loans, see note 4.3.

The financial liabilities have been measured at amortised cost. The terms of the instruments have been reviewed for the existence
of embedded derivatives. The 2022 fixed rate loan notes and the 2025 USD loan notes both contain an early repayment option that
meets the definition of an embedded derivative. However, in both cases, these have not been separated as they are deemed to be
closely related to the host contract. At 31 December 2018, the fair value of the loan notes was £4.6 million and in excess of the carrying
value of £574.3 million (based on quoted market prices).

## SECTION 7: RISK MANAGEMENT continued

7.4 HEDGE RESERVE
The Group designates certain hedging instruments used to address commodity price risk and foreign exchange risk as cash flow
hedges. At the inception of the hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item is documented, along with
its risk management objectives. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether
the hedging instruments used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items.
Changes in fair value of contracts designated into such hedging relationships are recognised within the hedge reserve to the extent
they are effective.

The cumulative gains and losses unwind and are released as the related contracts mature and we take delivery of the associated
commodity or currency.

At 31 December 199.9 126.1

Commodity contracts and financial contracts are released from equity to revenue or cost of sales in the income statement. Gains and
losses on the cross currency interest rate swap are released to interest costs.

The Group’s cash flow hedges relate to commodity contracts (principally commitments to sell power) and forward foreign currency
exchange contracts. Amounts are recognised in the hedge reserve as the designated contracts are marked-to-market at each period
end for the effective portion of the hedge, which is generally 100% of the relevant contract. Amounts held within the hedge reserve
are then released as the related contract matures and the hedged transaction impacts profit or loss. For power sales contracts, this is
when the underlying power is delivered. For currency contracts, this is when the associated foreign currency transaction is recognised.
Further information about the Group’s accounting for financial instruments is included in note 7.2.

Included in amounts released from equity are gains and losses on financial instruments that matured in a previous period, released to
the income statement in the period the hedged transaction occurs. No ineffectiveness was recognised in the income statement in the
year (2017: £Nil). Due to the nature of the hedge relationships, the movement in value for the hedged items and hedging instruments
are comparable.

The expected release profile from equity of post-tax hedging gains and losses is as follows:

7.5 COST OF HEDGING RESERVE
On transition to IFRS 9, the Group has elected to allocate unrealised gains and losses on the forward rate of foreign currency derivative
contracts to a new cost of hedging reserve. The prior year amounts have been restated and a reconciliation is provided in note 8.3.

A large proportion of the derivative contracts relate to foreign exchange contracts, including forward contracts, options and swaps.
Consistent with prior periods, the Group has continued to designate the change in fair value of the spot rate in the Group’s cash flow
hedge relationships. As part of the transition to IFRS 9, an election was made to designate the cost of hedging – being the change in
fair value associated with forward points including currency basis – to equity. This change in policy has been applied retrospectively.
As a result, the Group’s loss on initial application has decreased and the corresponding increase was taken through equity to a new
cost of hedging reserve.

The cumulative gains and losses unwind and are released as the related contracts mature and we take delivery of the associated currency.

7.6 CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
Contingent liabilities are potential future outflows of cash that are dependent on a future event that is outside of the control of the
Group. The amount or timing of any payment is uncertain and cannot be measured reliably.

Capacity market suspension
On 15 November 2018 the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union found in favour of a claim against the European
Commission, annulling the Commission’s State aid approval of the UK Capacity Market. This ruling imposed a standstill period on the
Capacity Market, with payments under existing contracts and future capacity auctions suspended indefinitely until re-approval.
Following this ruling, the Group ceased to accrue capacity market income in Power Generation. Any revenue up to 30 September was
received, but from this date no amounts have been recognised.

The Department for Business, Energy, Innovation and Skills (BEIS) has indicated its intent, in a consultation document dated 19
December 2018, to work with the European Commission to achieve a reinstatement of the Capacity Market as soon as possible.
Furthermore, BEIS has indicated that, upon reinstatement, it expects to make back payments to Generators who have complied with
their capacity agreements during the standstill period. At the date of signing these accounts the Group has complied with its capacity
obligations in full. However, reinstatement remains conditional upon EU State aid re-approval and accordingly at the date of these
accounts remains uncertain.

If the capacity market is reinstated and payments are backdated, the Group will receive income of £7 million in respect of payments
due to the Power Generation business which would become payable in respect of the year ended 31 December 2018.

As disclosed in note 5.1, should 100% of the contracted Capacity Market payments for the Acquired Generation Business not be
received in respect of the period 1 January to 30 September 2019, a risk sharing mechanism may result in further payments being made
either to or from the Group in respect of the acquisition.

## SECTION 7: RISK MANAGEMENT continued

7.6 CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES continued
Guarantees
In addition to the amount drawn down against the bank loans, certain members of the Group guarantee the obligations of a number
of banks in respect of letters of credit issued by those banks to counterparties of the Group. As at 31 December 2018, the Group’s
contingent liability in respect of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility amounted to £31.8 million (2017: £35.7 million).

The Group also guarantees obligations in the form of surety bonds with a number of insurers amounting to £63.7 million
(2017: £41.3 million).

Guaranteed Minimum Pension
The Group has previously disclosed a contingent liability in respect of the equalisation of Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP).
On 26 October 2018, the High Court issued a judgement confirming that schemes should be amended to equalise benefits in relation
to GMP for men and women.

Accordingly, the Group has included the estimated cost of equalisation (£0.6m) in calculating its defined benefit pension obligations
at 31 December 2018 (see note 6.3).

7.7 COMMITMENTS
The Group has a number of financial commitments (i.e. a contractual requirement to make a cash payment in the future) that are not
recorded in the balance sheet as the contract is not yet due for delivery. Such commitments include contracts for the future purchase
of coal and biomass, operating leases for land and buildings, contracts for the construction of assets and contracts for the provision
of services.

Commitments to purchase fuel reflect long-term forward purchase contracts with a variety of international suppliers, primarily for the
delivery of sustainable wood pellets for use in electricity production at Drax Power Station over the period from 2019–2027. To the
extent these contracts relate to the purchase of wood pellets, they are not reflected elsewhere in the financial statements owing
to application of the “own-use” exemption from fair value accounting to such contracts (see note 7.2).

The future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows:

## SECTION 8: REFERENCE INFORMATION

This section details reference information relevant to the accounts. Here we describe the general information about the Group
(e.g. operations and registered office). We also set out the basis of preparation of the accounts and general accounting policies that
are not specific to any one note.

8.1 GENERAL INFORMATION
Drax Group plc (the Company) is incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act. The Company and its subsidiaries
(together, the Group) have three principal activities:

- electricity generation;

- electricity supply to business customers; and

- manufacturing of sustainable compressed wood pellets for use in electricity production.

The Group’s activities are principally based within the UK, with the wood pellet manufacturing activities situated in the US.

The address of the Company’s registered office and principal establishment is Drax Power Station, Selby, North Yorkshire, YO8 8PH,
United Kingdom. A full list of operating companies of the Group is disclosed in note 5 to the Company’s separate financial statements,
which follow these consolidated financial statements.

8.2 BASIS OF PREPARATION
Adoption of new and revised accounting standards
A number of new and amended standards became effective for the first time in 2018. The Group adopted the following from
1 January 2018:

IFRS 2 – Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions – effective for annual periods beginning on or after
1 January 2018.

IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.

IFRS 15 (including clarifications issued on 12 April 2016) – Revenue from Contracts with Customers – effective for annual reporting
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.

IFRIC 22 – Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after
1 January 2018.

Other than the adoption of IFRS 9, these updates and amendments have not had a material impact on the financial statements of the
Group. The transition disclosures for IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 have been included in note 8.3.

At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following new or amended standards and relevant interpretations,
which have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective (and some of which were pending
endorsement by the EU – marked by *):

IAS 40 (amended) – Investment Property – effective for annual reportings beginning on or after 1 July 2018.*

IFRIC 23 – Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments – effective for annual reports beginning on or after 1 January 2019.*

IFRS 16 (amended) – Leases – effective for annual reports beginning on or after 1 January 2019.

IFRS 10 (amended) – Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 (amended) – Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (2011)
– effective date deferred indefinitely.*

IAS 28 (amended) – Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures – effective from 1 January 2019.

## SECTION 8: REFERENCE INFORMATION continued

8.2 BASIS OF PREPARATION continued
Adoption of the other standards in future periods is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group,
other than IFRS 16 as noted below.

IFRS 16 – Leases
The Group will adopt IFRS 16 from 1 January 2019 and has chosen to adopt the modified retrospective application. Consequently,
comparative information in the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2018 will not be restated.

The new requirements will impact the Group’s accounting for lease contracts.

The Group’s current operating lease portfolio predominantly relates to properties and the hire of plant and equipment at operating
sites. On transition to IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019, these leases will be brought onto the balance sheet as right-of-use assets, and the
Group will recognise a corresponding liability for the amounts payable under the lease contracts.

On transition, the Group will make use of the practical expedient available not to reassess whether a contract is or contains a lease.
Accordingly, the definition of a lease in accordance with IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 will continue to apply to those leases entered into or
modified before 1 January 2019. However, the Group will apply the new definition of a lease to all contracts entered into or modified on
or after 1 January 2019. We do not anticipate this change to have a significant impact on the assessment of contracts that are in scope
of the definition of a lease.

For short-term leases (12 months or less) and leases of low value assets, the Group will elect to recognise a lease expense on a straightline basis as permitted by IFRS 16. Short-term leases include those which end within 12 months of transition.

Under IFRS 16, right-of-use assets will be tested for impairment in accordance with our policy outlined in note 2.4. This will replace the
previous requirement to recognise a provision for onerous lease contracts.

Impact on lease accounting
As at the reporting date, the Group has non-cancellable operating lease commitments of approximately £31 million.

A preliminary assessment has been concluded that indicates the Group will recognise a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease
liability of approximately £20 million on transition to the new standard in 2019. This value is lower than the value of non-cancellable
minimum lease payments owing to the existence of short-term and low-value leases, and the effect of discounting.

The preliminary assessment indicates that £18 million of the existing lease obligations relate to short-term and leases of low value assets.
The effect of discounting has been estimated for the purpose of this analysis. The anticipated effect on profit or loss (compared to 2018
results for lease contracts in existence at the balance sheet date) is a reduction in administrative and operating expenses of
approximately £5 million, offset by increases in depreciation of approximately £4 million and finance costs of approximately £1 million.

Actual values may differ from those in this preliminary assessment.

Due to the timing of the transaction the Group has not yet completed any detailed analysis of lease contracts acquired as part of the
ScottishPower generation portfolio for this purpose. Initial investigations indicate the largest lease in the portfolio has a present value
of approximately £5 million.

8.3 ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND CHANGE IN PRESENTATION OF INCOME STATEMENT
IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 supersedes IAS 11 Construction Contracts, IAS 18 Revenue and related interpretations. It applies to all revenue arising from
contracts with customers, unless those contracts are in the scope of other standards. Adoption of IFRS 15 has not resulted in any
changes to the amounts recognised in these financial statements compared to the previous requirements, nor any restatement
of the prior period comparative information.

The adoption of IFRS 15 has not resulted in any changes to the amount or timing of revenue recognised in either period. In accordance
with the transition provisions in IFRS 15, the Group has adopted the new requirements retrospectively and has reclassified certain
balance sheet receivables and payables for the 2017 financial year. The Group has applied certain practical expedients on initial
application including the exemption from the requirement to apply the standard to contracts that begin and end within the same
annual reporting period and contracts completed before 1 January 2017. These practical expedients did not have a material effect
on the financial statements.

The accounting policies, as disclosed in the Annual Report and Accounts for 31 December 2017, have not materially changed. Particular
areas for consideration have been in respect of the growing B2B Energy Supply Segment which supplies to businesses ranging from
micro-businesses to large Industrial & Commercial participants. Larger customers actively rather than passively renew their supply
contracts. These contracts have been separated into two main categories; those with a fixed price for a contracted period of time,
and those with a variable or flexible price where the contract price varies according to changes in the cost of supply.

For fixed price contracts, progress is measured with reference to the costs of supply incurred at the point the energy is delivered and
revenue is accrued or deferred accordingly. For variable rate and flexible contracts, revenue is recognised at a point in time when the
energy is supplied and is measured at the contracted price per unit supplied.

The B2B Energy Supply business accrues revenue based on estimated usage each period and this is recognised in the balance sheet as
accrued income. Where the consideration received from the customer is in advance of supply, revenue is deferred on the balance sheet.

Generation revenue continues to be recognised at the point of delivery. Activities within the scope of IFRS 9 (see below) are outside
the scope of IFRS 15.

IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement for periods beginning on or after
1 January 2018, bringing together all three aspects of accounting for financial instruments: classification and measurement;
impairment; and hedge accounting which has been fully adopted by the Group.

On transition to IFRS 9, the key change in the Group’s accounting policy for financial instruments is to recognise the ‘cost of hedging’
(explained below) initially in a reserve, rather than the income statement. Amounts are subsequently reclassified from the cost of
hedging reserve and recognised in cost of sales in the same period as the hedged item. This change in policy has been applied
retrospectively with comparative information for the period beginning 1 January 2017 being adjusted as though the cost of hedging
approach had always been applied for those derivatives that existed at or since 1 January 2017.

Unrealised fair value gains and losses on cash flow hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income. Gains and losses relating
to fuel purchases, which will be recycled to inventory in the balance sheet, are released directly from the hedge reserve.

Prior year comparatives have not been restated for other aspects of IFRS 9, as the effect is not material.

In respect of accounting for trade and other receivables, the Group has applied IFRS 9’s simplified approach to provisioning and has
calculated this using lifetime expected losses. This calculation has had no material impact on the financial statements.

The transition to the new standard is complete; however, the Group will monitor emerging developments and interpretations of the
new standard.

Changes in presentation of income statement
All gains and losses on derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are included in revenue or cost of sales as and
when they arise.

However, since the purpose of the derivative contracts concerned is to hedge certain risk exposures, principally commodity price
and foreign currency risks, a columnar format has been adopted for the income statement in which adjusted results are presented,
excluding certain gains and losses arising from remeasuring derivative contracts to fair value. The purpose of adjusted results is
to reflect sales of electricity and purchases of fuel at the contracted price. This includes the effect of relevant financial derivatives
(such as forward foreign currency contracts) used to secure the all-in sale or purchase price of the commodity concerned.

## SECTION 8: REFERENCE INFORMATION continued

8.3 ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND CHANGE IN PRESENTATION OF INCOME STATEMENT continued
The adjusted results therefore in effect apply the accounting treatment that would have applied under IFRS 9 had the derivative
contracts concerned qualified for hedge accounting. This is consistent with the practice followed by other major UK power generation
companies. This change has been applied retrospectively but has not changed the prior year results, only their presentation.

The impact on the previously reported amounts in the income statement and statement of comprehensive income, due to changes in
accounting policies, are set out in the tables below. There have been no changes to the balance sheet other than the creation of a cost
of hedging reserve.

8.3 ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND CHANGE IN PRESENTATION OF INCOME STATEMENT continued
(a) Adoption of IFRS 9
A large proportion of our derivative contracts relate to foreign exchange contracts, including forward contracts, options and swaps.
Consistent with prior periods, the Group has continued to designate the change in fair value of the spot rate in the Group’s cash flow
hedge relationships. As part of the transition, an election has been made to apply the cost of hedging approach resulting in the change
in fair value associated with forward points, including currency basis, being initially recognised in equity and subsequently reclassified
to profit or loss. This change in policy has been applied retrospectively. As a result, the Group reclassified £57.5 million of cumulative
losses to the new cost of hedging reserve on initial application and restated the 2017 financial results to reflect £20.8 million of gains
(plus associated tax of £4.0 million) in the cost of hedging reserve.

Fair value gains and losses on cash flow hedges of £85.7 million that relate to fuel purchases, which were recycled to inventory in the
balance sheet, have been restated as though they were released directly from reserves and therefore are no longer recognised in Other
comprehensive income. The related deferred tax of £(15.6) million has also been reallocated.

Impairment losses on trade receivables are now disclosed separately on the face of the income statement (previously included within
operational and administrative expenses). Application of IFRS 9 has not had a material impact on the value of trade receivable
impairment losses.

b) Representation of the income statement
Unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts have been included in the line item to which they relate.

(c) Other losses
There were no material adjustments to the Group’s classification and measurement of financial instruments.

The Group has changed its policy regarding the classification of listed equity investments from fair value through profit and loss to fair
value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).

(d) Tax charge
Upon adoption of IFRS 9, deferred tax and income tax values were adjusted accordingly.

8.4 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
A related party is either an individual or entity with control or significant influence over the Group, or a company that is linked to us
by investment (such as an associated company or joint venture). Our primary related parties are our key management personnel.

Remuneration of key management personnel
The remuneration of the directors and Executive Committee members, who are considered to be the key management personnel of
the Group, is set out below in aggregate for each of the categories specified in IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures. Further information
about the remuneration of individual directors, together with the directors’ interests in the share capital of Drax Group plc, is provided

## SECTION 8: REFERENCE INFORMATION continued

8.5 UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF THE ENLARGED GROUP
As required by the Listing Rules, the Group reproduces below the unaudited pro forma financial information included in Part VI on
pages 51-55 of the Class 1 circular, published on 5 December 2018 in connection with acquisition of the Acquired Generation Business.

[Capitalised terms on this note are defined within the Class I circular, available at www.drax.com/circular2018.](http://www.drax.com/circular2018)

The unaudited pro forma income statement and unaudited pro forma net assets statement of the Enlarged Group (together the
“Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information”) set out below has been prepared on the basis of the notes below, and in accordance
with Listing Rule 13.3.3R, to illustrate the impact of the Acquisition on the income statement of Drax Group plc for the year ended
31 December 2017, as if it had taken place on 1 January 2017, and on the net assets of Drax Group plc as at 31 December 2017, as if it had
taken place at that date.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information has been prepared on a basis consistent with the accounting policies and presentation
adopted by Drax Group plc in relation to its consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 and includes the
combined income statement of the ScottishPower Generation Group for the year ended 31 December 2017 and net assets of the
ScottishPower Generation Group as at 31 December 2017.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and, by its nature, addresses a
hypothetical situation and does not, therefore, represent the Enlarged Group’s actual financial position or results. The Unaudited Pro
Forma Financial Information does not purport to represent what the Enlarged Group’s financial position and results of operations
actually would have been if the Acquisition had been completed on the dates indicated, nor does it purport to represent the results
of operations for any future period or the financial condition at any future date.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information does not constitute financial statements within the meaning of section 434 of the
Companies Act 2006. Shareholders should read the whole of this Circular and not rely solely on the summarised financial information
contained in this Part VI (Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information relating to the Enlarged Group).

31 December 2017.
(2) The net assets of the ScottishPower Generation Group have been extracted without adjustment from the historical financial information included in Part V (Historical Financial
Information relating to the ScottishPower Generation Group) of this Circular.
(3) The Unaudited Pro Forma Statement of Net Assets has been prepared on the basis that the Transaction will be treated as a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3. However,
it does not reflect any fair value adjustments to the acquired assets and liabilities, as the fair value measurement of these items will only be performed at the date of Completion. The
fair value adjustments, when finalised, may be material. For the purpose of the pro forma statement of net assets, the excess purchase consideration over the carrying amount of net
assets of £456.8m has been attributed to property, plant & equipment.

– Amounts payable to Related Parties (113.6)

– Related Party borrowings (502.4)

Preliminary uplift in value of Property, plant & equipment 456.8

Upon completion of the acquisition, the Drax Group will draw down on an acquisition bridge facility with a maximum value of £725m.
For the purpose of the unaudited pro forma statement of net assets, the entire purchase price of £702m plus estimated acquisitionrelated costs of £23m have been funded by the acquisition bridge facility. Drax may use available cash reserves to reduce the amount
drawn on completion.

The acquisition-related costs are not included in the calculation of the preliminary uplift as they will be expensed as transaction costs
or capitalised as borrowing costs, as required by IFRS.

£18m of the acquisition-related costs are expected to be directly attributable to the purchase of the ScottishPower Generation Group.
These costs will be expensed in the income statement.

£5m of the acquisition-related costs are expected to be directly attributable to the acquisition bridge facility. These costs will be
capitalised and offset against total borrowings and are expected to be amortised over the 19-month term of the bridge facility as
required by IFRS. This increases interest payable by £3.2m (being 12/19 months’ amortisation of these costs) and reducing borrowings
by £1.8m in the unaudited pro forma statements.

##### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF DRAX GROUP PLC

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Opinion
In our opinion:

– the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017
and of the group’s loss for the year then ended;
– the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as
adopted by the European Union;
– the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice including Financial Reporting Standard 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”; and
– the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.

We have audited the financial statements of Drax Group plc (the "parent company") and its subsidiaries ("the group") which comprise:

– the consolidated income statement;
– the consolidated statement of comprehensive income;
– the consolidated and parent company balance sheets;
– the consolidated and parent company statements of changes in equity;
– the consolidated cash flow statement;
– the basis of preparation and statement of accounting policies;
– the related group notes 2.1 to 8.3; and
– the related parent company notes 1 to 9

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as
adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent company financial
statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework” (United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

BASIS FOR OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities
under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.

We are independent of the group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the
financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We confirm that the non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical
Standard were not provided to the group or the parent company.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

SUMMARY OF OUR AUDIT APPROACH

Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:
– Asset impairment of Drax Power
– Valuation of commodity and foreign exchange contracts
– Estimation of retail unbilled revenue

Within this report, any new key audit matters are identified with and any key audit matters which are the
same as the prior year identified with

Materiality The materiality that we used for the group financial statements was £6.8m (2016: £4.2m). This was
determined on a blended basis taking into consideration a number of available metrics, with particular focus
on Earnings before Interest, Taxation, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) and excluding unrealised gains
or losses on derivative contracts and material one-off items, as this measure is of direct relevance to readers
of the financial statements. Our selected materiality represents approximately 3% of EBITDA for the year.

Scoping We focused our group audit scope primarily on the audit work at four locations, being Drax Power, Haven
Power, Opus Energy and Drax Biomass. All of these were subject to a full scope audit. These four locations
represent the principal business units and account for virtually all of the group’s net assets, revenue and
profit before tax.


Significant changes
in our approach


We have completed the audit of Opus Energy for the first time, following its acquisition by the Group in
February 2017. Other aspects of our audit approach remain broadly consistent to the prior year but we have
continued to refine our key audit matters as detailed below.

CONCLUSIONS RELATING TO GOING CONCERN, PRINCIPAL RISKS AND VIABILITY STATEMENT

Going concern
We have reviewed the directors’ statement on page 119 to the financial statements about whether they
considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them and their
identification of any material uncertainties to the group’s and company’s ability to continue to do so over a
period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements.

We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to that
statement required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) and report if the statement is materially inconsistent with our
knowledge obtained in the audit.

Principal risks and viability statement
Based solely on reading the directors’ statements and considering whether they were consistent with the
knowledge we obtained in the course of the audit, including the knowledge obtained in the evaluation of
the directors’ assessment of the group’s and the company’s ability to continue as a going concern, we are
required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
– the disclosures on pages 51–57 that describe the principal risks and explain how they are being
managed or mitigated;
– the directors' confirmation on page 111 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal
risks facing the group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance,
solvency or liquidity; or
– the directors’ explanation on page 50 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the group, over
what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement
as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation
and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.

We are also required to report whether the directors’ statement relating to the prospects of the group
required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.


We confirm that we have
nothing material to report, add
or draw attention to in respect
of these matters.

We confirm that we have
nothing material to report, add
or draw attention to in respect
of these matters.


KEY AUDIT MATTERS
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements for
the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified.
These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and
directing the efforts of the engagement team.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we
do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

We previously identified onsite biomass stocks as a key audit matter reflecting the judgement inherent in calculating the volume of biomass
stocks owned by the Group. Following the reduction in biomass stock as a result of an onsite fire during December 2017, we no longer
consider this to be a key audit matter.

The appropriateness of asset useful economic life assumptions is no longer considered to be a key audit matter following the reduction in
the accounting lives of the coal specific assets from 1 January 2017.

The valuation and recoverability of Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) is no longer considered to be a key audit matter. The ROC
valuation process has historically been free from material error and it is well established.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF DRAX GROUP PLC CONTINUED

ASSET IMPAIRMENT OF DRAX POWER

Key audit matter description Property, plant and equipment of £1.7bn (2016: £1.6bn) is held on the balance sheet at the year end, the
majority of which relates to the power generation plant. Net assets at the year end were £1.7bn (2016: £2bn)
and the market capitalisation was £1.1bn (2016:£1.5bn).

Management considered indicators of impairment in respect of each Cash Generating Unit (CGU). Despite
improvements in achieved spreads within key commodity markets and a period of relative stability with
respect to relevant government policy, the market capitalisation of the Group continues to be below the
net asset value. This is considered to be an indicator of the risk of impairment and accordingly management
performed an impairment review for the Drax Power CGU in the current year, as this is the CGU which
contains the majority of the Group’s assets.

As noted in the Group’s critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions in note 2.4 and the Audit
Committee report on page 76, asset impairment has been considered a key risk by the Audit Committee. Fixed
assets are disclosed in note 3.1.

The impairment testing is subject to the application of management judgement in identifying relevant
CGUs and various assumptions underlying the calculation of the value in use for each CGU identified. These
assumptions include the achievability of the long-term business plan. Management’s assessment also
considers changes in the business which may give rise to additional CGUs, for example the acquisition of
Opus Energy in February 2017.

Due to the level of management judgement involved in assessing impairment, we have identified this as a
fraud risk.

The significant judgements made by management have been disclosed in note 2.4 and include:
– The expected operating lives of the six generating units;
– Future commodity prices beyond the horizon of existing contracted purchases, particular long-term power
prices at both baseload and peak times, and future biomass prices, particularly given that biomass is not a
standardised commodity traded openly on exchanges;
– The continuance of existing biomass support regimes until 2027 and the existence of a favourable
economic environment for biomass generation thereafter; and
– The discount rate applied to forecast future cashflows.


How the scope of our audit
responded to the key audit
matter


We evaluated the design and implementation of key controls related to asset impairment testing.

We have challenged management’s identification of CGUs, taking into consideration the independence of
cash flows across key components of the business and across the power generating units.

We identified the key judgements made by management and utilised our internal valuation specialists to
benchmark key market related assumptions including future commodity prices, current and future capacity
and other support mechanisms and discount rates against external data where available. For example, we
have compared the commodity price assumptions to the latest available Department for Business, Energy
and Industrial Strategy (DBEIS) and National Grid forecasts.

We have considered the liquidity of the biomass market and the impact that Drax could have on that market
as a result of the volumes of biomass it requires and its potential impact on price.

We have also challenged the underlying assumptions and significant judgements used in management’s
impairment model by:
– Running a range of sensitivities to assess whether an impairment would be required if a range of more
conservative assumptions were adopted;
– Assessing the historical accuracy of management’s budgets and forecasts by comparing them to actual
performance;
– Verifying the mathematical accuracy of the cash flow models; and
– Assessing whether the disclosures in note 2.4 of the financial statements appropriately disclose the key
judgements taken so that the reader of the accounts is aware of the impact in the financial statements of
changes to key assumptions that may lead to impairment.


-----

ASSET IMPAIRMENT OF DRAX POWER CONTINUED

Key observations We are satisfied that the discount rate is determined based on acceptable valuation methodologies. While it
is lower than the ranges determined by our internal valuation specialists, increasing the discount rate to be
within our range would not lead to an impairment.

Although we note that assumptions relating to long term revenues and costs are inherently difficult
to assess, we believe that the assumptions used by management were reasonable, and based on the
sensitivities that we performed on these assumptions, we are satisfied that no impairment is required.

VALUATION OF COMMODITY AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS

Key audit matter description Unrealised losses on derivative contracts recognised in the income statement in the year are £156m (2016:
unrealised gains of £177m), with related derivative assets of £366m and liabilities of £204m recognised on the
balance sheet as at 31 December 2017.

The valuation of derivative contracts is complex and requires judgement in areas including the selection
of appropriate valuation methodologies, and assumptions in respect of future market prices and credit risk
factors.

Due to the large amount of data involved in the contract valuations, and the requirement for certain manual
adjustments, we have identified a fraud risk relating to management or employees of the company valuing
trades inappropriately.

Further detail of the key judgements are disclosed in the Group’s critical accounting judgements, estimates
and assumptions set out on pages 119 and 120 and the Audit Committee report on pages 76 to 80. Section 7
sets out the financial risk management notes.


How the scope of our audit
responded to the key audit
matter


We evaluated the design and implementation and tested the operating effectiveness of key controls related
to the valuation of commodity and foreign exchange contracts.

We used our internal financial instrument specialists to test management’s key judgements and calculations,
including testing a sample of trades undertaken to trade tickets, confirming key contractual terms such as
volumes and contracted prices.

We have assessed the valuation models used by management, including any manual adjustments to
determine the fair value of the derivative instruments and performed independent valuations across a
sample of both commodity and foreign exchange contracts.

We have analysed the appropriateness of management’s forward price curve assumptions by benchmarking
these to third party sources and reviewed the consistency of the assumptions used across other areas of the
financial statements, such as asset impairment.

We have challenged management’s approach and assumptions involved in assessing fair value adjustments
such as credit risk, time value of money and spread adjustments.


Key observations From our testing, we are satisfied that the valuation of commodity and foreign exchange contracts is
appropriate. We consider the valuation models used by management to be appropriate and the forward curve
assumptions adopted are within an acceptable range.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF DRAX GROUP PLC CONTINUED

ESTIMATION OF RETAIL UNBILLED REVENUE

Key audit matter description The recognition of retail revenue requires an estimation of customer usage between the date of the last
meter reading and year end, which is known as unbilled revenue.

Across the retail division, unbilled revenue at the balance sheet date amounted to £195 million
(2016: £119 million).

The method of estimating unbilled revenues is complex and judgemental and requires assumptions for both
the volumes of energy consumed by customers and the related value.

We identified a fraud risk in relation to revenue recognition in the retail business, in particular to the estimates
underpinning unbilled revenue as these judgement areas could be manipulated by management to mis-report
revenue.

Further detail of the key judgements are disclosed in the Group’s critical accounting judgements, estimates
and assumptions set out on pages 119 and 120 and the Audit Committee report on pages 76 to 80. Accrued
income is disclosed in note 3.5.


How the scope of our audit
responded to the key audit
matter


We evaluated the design and implementation and tested the operating effectiveness of key controls related
to the estimation of unbilled revenue. This included controls over the reconciliation of meter readings
provided by the energy markets, and which are used by management to estimate the power supplied. We also
tested the controls over the price per unit applied in the valuation of unbilled revenue.

When external market information was not available at the balance sheet date we also obtained and
considered management’s reconciliation of the volume of power purchased to their calculations of
revenue supplied and completed sample tests to check that the December unbilled revenue amount was
subsequently billed.

We also reviewed the aggregate unbilled revenue balance from previous periods to test that the amounts
recognised were subsequently billed in line with the values accrued.


Key observations Our retrospective reviews of estimated revenues found that management have historically achieved a high
level of accuracy. We considered the estimates for revenue made in the year to be appropriate.

OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a
reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in
evaluating the results of our work.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:

Group financial statements Parent company financial statements

Materiality £6.8m (2016: £4.2m) £4.1m (2016: £3.8m)


Basis for determining
materiality

Rationale for the
benchmark applied


We have determined materiality by considering
a range of possible benchmarks and the figures
derived from those, with a particular focus on
selecting a materiality within the range that we
considered appropriate. This included EBITDA
(excluding unrealised gains or losses on derivative
contracts and material one-off items), profit before
and after interest and tax as well as the scale of the
balance sheet and the overall size of the business.
The increase in materiality from prior year is
primarily due to the acquisition of Opus Energy.

Our selected materiality represents approximately
3% of EBITDA for the year.

When determining materiality, we have considered
the size and scale of the business and the nature
of its operations. We have also considered which
benchmarks would be of relevance to the users of
the financial statements.


We have capped materiality at 60% of the materiality
identified for the Group. This is a judgement and
reflects the significant value of investments held on
the balance sheet at the year end (£713m).

When determining materiality, we considered the net
assets of the company as its principal activity is as an
investment holding company for the Group.


-----

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £0.3m (2016: £0.2m) for the
parent company and group, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also
report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.

AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT
Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the group and its environment, including group-wide controls, and assessing
the risks of material misstatement at the group level. Based on that assessment, we focused our group audit scope primarily on the audit
work at four locations (2016: three locations which excludes Opus Energy which was acquired in February 2017), being Drax Power, Haven
Power, Opus Energy and Drax Biomass. All of these locations were subject to a full scope audit and they represent the principal business
units and account for virtually all of the group’s net assets, revenue and profit before tax, in line with 2016. They were also selected to provide
an appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement identified above. Our audit work at four
locations was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity which were lower than group materiality and ranged from
£3.5 million to £5.2 million (2015: £2.1 million to £3.8 million).

At the parent company level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that
there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject to
audit or audit of specified account balances.

During 2017 the Senior Statutory Auditor visited two of the four key locations being Drax Power and Drax Biomass, and other senior team
members visited the remaining two.

OTHER INFORMATION


Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent
otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required
to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there
is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

In this context, matters that we are specifically required to report to you as uncorrected material
misstatements of the other information include where we conclude that:
– Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the directors that they consider the annual
report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the
information necessary for shareholders to assess the group’s position and performance, business model
and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or
– Audit committee reporting – the section describing the work of the audit committee does not
appropriately address matters communicated by us to the audit committee; or
– Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code – the parts of the
directors’ statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the company’s compliance with the UK
Corporate Governance Code containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance
with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the UK
Corporate Governance Code.


We have nothing to report in
respect of these matters


RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to
enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as
a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the
directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance,
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website

##### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


INTRODUCTION
The consolidated financial statements provide detailed information
about the financial performance (Consolidated income statement),
financial position (Consolidated balance sheet), and cash flows
(Consolidated cash flow statement) of Drax Group plc (the Company)
together with all of the entities controlled by the Company
(collectively, the Group).

The notes to the financial statements provide additional information
on the items in the Consolidated income statement, Consolidated
balance sheet and Consolidated cash flow statement. The notes
include explanations of the information presented. In general, the
additional information in the notes to the financial statements is
required by law, International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
or other regulations to facilitate increased understanding of the
primary statements set out on pages 122–126.

BASIS OF PREPARATION
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and therefore the
consolidated financial statements comply with Article 4 of the
EU IAS Regulation and the Companies Act 2006.

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost
basis, except for certain financial assets and liabilities (principally
derivative financial instruments) that have been measured at fair
value.

Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the
exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. At each balance
sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in
foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that
date. Non-monetary items are not retranslated.

Foreign exchange gains and losses arising on such revaluations are
recognised in the income statement within finance costs.

Foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations with a functional
currency other than Sterling are translated into Sterling using
published exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and
expenditure of such operations are translated into Sterling using the
exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Foreign
exchange gains and losses resulting from the retranslation of the
operation’s net assets and its results for the year are recognised in
the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

Going concern
The Group’s business activities, along with future developments
that may affect its financial performance, position and cash flows,
are discussed within the Strategic report on pages 1–57 of this
Annual Report.

In the viability statement on page 50 the directors state that they
have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the
next three years.

Consequently, the directors also have a reasonable expectation that
the Group will continue in existence for the next 12 months and,
therefore, have adopted the going concern basis in preparing these
financial statements.


Basis of consolidation
These consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial
results of the Company and of all entities controlled by the Company,
(its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. The Company
owns 100% of the equity of all subsidiaries.

The Group acquired and gained control of Opus Energy on
10 February 2017 (see note 5.1). Opus Energy's financial results from
this date are included in the Group's Consolidated income statement.

The Group sold its holding in Billington Bioenergy on 31 October 2017.
Billington Bioenergy's financial results, until this date, are included
within the Consolidated income statement.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The significant accounting policies for the measurement of an
individual item in the financial statements are described in the note
to the financial statements relating to the item concerned (see
contents on page 121).

No changes have been made to accounting policies in the year.

A full listing of new standards, interpretations and pronouncements
under IFRS applicable to these financial statements is presented in
note 8.2. The application of these new requirements has not had a
material effect on the financial statements. Note 8.2 also includes
the anticipated impact of IFRS 9, 15 and 16 which will affect the
financial statements in future periods.

JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements requires judgement to be
applied in forming the Group’s accounting policies. It also requires
the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results
may differ from these estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing
basis, with revisions recognised in the period in which the estimates
are revised and in any future periods affected.

The judgements involving a higher degree of estimation or
complexity are set out below and in more detail, including sensitivity
analysis where appropriate, in the related notes.

Critical accounting judgements
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving
estimation (which are dealt with separately below), made in the
process of applying the Group's accounting policies during the year
that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in
the financial statements:

Accounting treatment applied to acquisition of LaSalle pellet
production assets – the Group acquired the assets at the LaSalle
pellet production plant on 13 April 2017. Having assessed the
circumstances, notably that the plant was acquired without
employees, input or output contracts and required significant
investment prior to commissioning, it was concluded that the
transaction represented an asset purchase and not the acquisition
of a business. Accordingly, the assets have been recognised as
additions to property, plant and equipment in the year.

See note 3.1 on page 138


-----

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

Sources of estimation uncertainty
The following are the sources of estimation uncertainty that carry
the most significant risk of a material effect on next year's accounts
– that is, the items where actual outcomes in the next 12 months
could vary significantly from the estimates made in determining the
reported amount of an asset or liability.

Property, plant and equipment – property, plant and equipment is
depreciated on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life.
Useful economic lives are estimated and based on past experience,
future replacement cycles and other available evidence. Useful
economic lives are reviewed annually. We reduced the useful lives of
coal-specific generation assets in our Power Generation business
from 1 January 2017.

See note 3.1 on page 138

Intangible assets – intangible assets acquired through the purchase
of Opus Energy have been recognised at their fair value. The fair
value measurement of the existing customer contracts depends on a
number of assumptions, and in particular requires estimates to be
made about likely margins on current customer contracts, future
contract renewal rates and future margins on renewed contracts.
The assets are amortised over their useful economic lives, which in
the case of the customer-related assets, have also been assessed
based on the future contract renewal rates. The amortisation rate
will change if the assumed renewal rates differ from actual
experience.

See note 5.3 on page 150

Impairment – an impairment review is conducted annually of
goodwill and of other assets and cash-generating units where an
indicator of possible impairment exists. In 2017, an impairment
assessment has been completed for three of the Group's CGUs. The
assessment of future cash flows that underpins such a review is
based on management’s best estimate of future commodity prices,
supply volumes and economic conditions. The calculations are
particularly sensitive to changes in the assumptions applied given
the long time period covered by the assessment.

See note 2.4 on page 131 and note 5.2 on page 149

Derivatives – derivative financial instruments are recorded in the
Group's balance sheet at fair value. The assessment of fair value is
derived from assuming a market price for the instrument in question.
The Group bases its assessment of market prices upon forward
curves that are largely derived from readily obtainable quotations
and third party sources. However, any forward curve is based at least
in part upon assumptions about future transactions and market
movements. Where such instruments extend beyond the liquid
portion of the forward curve, the level of estimation increases as the
number of observable transactions decreases.

See note 7.2 on page 164

Revenue recognition – the nature of some of the Group’s activities,
particularly within the B2B Energy Supply segment, results in
revenue being based on the estimated volumes of power supplied to
customers at an estimated average price per unit. Assumptions that
underpin these estimates are applied consistently and comparison
of past estimates to final settlements suggests a high degree of
accuracy. However, actual outcomes may vary from initial estimates.

See note 2.2 on page 129


Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) – ROC assets generated
by the Group's Power Generation business and held in the Group’s
balance sheet are stated at the lower of their deemed cost at the
point of generation and expected realisable value. The calculation of
this value depends upon estimates of likely future sales prices.

See note 3.3 on page 140

Pensions – the Group records a liability in its balance sheet for its
obligation to provide benefits under an approved defined benefit
pension scheme, less the fair value of assets held by the pension
scheme. The actuarial valuation of the scheme assets and liabilities
is performed annually and depends on assumptions regarding
interest rates, inflation, future salary and pension increases,
mortality and other factors, any of which are subject to future
change.

See note 6.3 on page 156

Taxation – in accounting for both current and deferred tax the Group
makes assumptions regarding the likely treatment of items of
income and expenditure for tax purposes. These assumptions are
based on interpretation of relevant legislation and, where required,
consultation with external advisers.

See note 2.6 on page 134

ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES (APMs)
We present two APMs (measures without formal definition in IFRS)
on the face of our income statement, EBITDA and underlying
earnings, to assist users of the accounts in evaluating the
comparability of the Group’s financial performance and the
performance against strategic objectives.

EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation,
amortisation and material one-off items that do not reflect the
underlying trading performance of the business. Interest, tax,
depreciation and amortisation are calculated in accordance
with IFRS.

EBITDA is the primary measure used by the Board and market
analysts to assess our financial performance.

The purpose of EBITDA is to provide a consistent, comparable
measure of the trading performance of the Group’s businesses
year on year.

Underlying earnings is defined as profit after tax, as calculated in
accordance with IFRS, adjusted to exclude unrealised gains and
losses on derivative contracts, which introduce volatility to IFRS
measures of net profitability, and material one-off items that do not
reflect the underlying performance of the business.

The purpose of underlying earnings is to provide a consistent,
comparable measure of the overall financial performance of the
Group’s businesses year-on-year, including costs of servicing the
existing debt, allocations of the cost of non-current assets and tax.

Judgement is applied in determining transactions which are not
considered to reflect the underlying trading performance of the
business.

EBITDA is reconciled to both gross profit and operating profit on
the face of the income statement. A reconciliation of underlying
earnings to profit after tax attributable to shareholders is provided
in note 2.7.

SECTION 2
### Financial performance

The financial performance section gives further information about the items in the Consolidated income statement. It includes a summary of
financial performance by each of our businesses (2.1), analysis of certain income statement items (2.2–2.6) and information regarding
underlying earnings, distributable profits and dividends (2.7–2.10). Further commentary on our trading and operational performance during
the year, which is predominantly reflected in EBITDA, can be found in the Strategic report on pages 1–57, with particular reference to key
transactions and market conditions that have affected our results.

2.1 SEGMENTAL REPORTING
The Group is organised into three businesses, with a dedicated management team for each and a central corporate office providing certain
specialist and shared functions. Our businesses are:

– Power Generation: power generation activities in the UK, including at Drax Power Station and the development of OCGT projects;
– Pellet Production: production of sustainable compressed wood pellets at our processing facilities in the US; and
– B2B Energy Supply: the supply of electricity and gas to business customers in the UK.

The operating segments have been renamed to align more closely with the strategy, but are consistent with the prior year, except for
changes due to business combinations as noted below. Each business is an operating segment for the purpose of segmental reporting.
Information reported to the Board for the purposes of assessing performance and making investment decisions is based on these three
operating segments. The measure of profit or loss for each reportable segment presented to the Board on a regular basis is EBITDA (as
defined on page 120).

Operating costs are allocated to segments to the extent they are directly attributable to the activities of that segment. Corporate office
costs are included within central costs.

During the year, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Opus Energy Group Limited (see note 5.1), an energy supply business
providing electricity and gas to business customers. Opus Energy’s activities are closely-related to those of the existing B2B Energy Supply
business and the B2B Energy Supply management structure has been reorganised to integrate Opus Energy into the existing structure.
Financial results are reported to the Board for the larger combined business. Accordingly, this new acquisition forms part of the B2B Energy
Supply segment in the year ended 31 December 2017. Note 5.1 details the additional revenue and profit attributable to the Group from the
new acquisition.

As noted on page 16, the Group sold its interest in Billington Bioenergy in the year. The B2B Energy Supply segment includes £6.3 million of
revenue and £0.2 million EBITDA losses in respect of this business for the 10-month period to the date of disposal.

The accounting policies applied for the purpose of measuring the segments’ profits or losses, assets and liabilities are the same as those
used in measuring the corresponding amounts in the Group’s financial statements. The external revenues and results of all the reporting
segments are subject to seasonality, with higher dispatch and prices in the winter months compared to summer months.

Capital expenditure by segment
Assets and working capital are monitored on a consolidated basis; however, spend on capital projects is monitored by operating segment.

Pellet Production 0.4 66.2 – 6.7

Corporate unallocated 0.6 3.8 – –

Total 16.0 164.6 0.7 96.8

Total cash outflows in relation to capital expenditure during the year were £175.2 million (2016: £93.2 million). The increase in capital
expenditure compared to the previous year principally reflects the acquisition of the LaSalle pellet plant and subsequent investment to bring
the site into operation in the Pellet Production segment, and investment in office space for Opus Energy in the B2B Energy Supply segment.

Intra-group trading
Intra-group transactions are carried out on arm’s-length, commercial terms that, where possible, equate to market prices at the time of
the transaction. During 2017, the Pellet Production segment sold wood pellets with a total value of £135.7 million (2016: £72.9 million) to
the Power Generation segment and the Power Generation segment sold electricity, gas and ROCs with a total value of £1,033.4 million
(2016: £868.2 million) to the B2B Energy Supply segment.

The impact of all intra-group transactions, including any unrealised profit arising (£9.8 million at 31 December 2017), is eliminated on
consolidation. Following the increase in output from Pellet Production during the year and reduced generation in Power Generation
at the end of the year, intra-group stocks were higher at the end of 2017 than previously, resulting in an increase in this provision.

Major customers
Total revenue for the year ended 31 December 2017 does not include any amounts from individual customers (2016: amounts of £541.5
million and £399.3 million derived from two customers) that represent 10% or more of total revenue for the year. The Group's largest two

2.2 REVENUE
Accounting policy
Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods or services provided in the normal course of business, net of trade discounts, VAT and
other sales-related taxes and excluding transactions between Group companies.

Revenues from the sale of electricity from our Power Generation business are measured based upon metered output delivered at rates
specified under contract terms or prevailing market rates as applicable.

Two of our biomass-fuelled generating units earn Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) under the UK Government’s Renewables
Obligation (RO) regime. The financial benefit of a ROC is recognised in the income statement at the point the relevant renewable biomass
fuel is burnt and power dispatched as a reduction in the cost of the biomass fuel. A corresponding asset is recognised on the balance sheet
(see note 3.3 on page 140). Revenue from sale of ROCs is recognised when the ROC is transferred to a third party.

The Group recognises the income or costs arising from the CfD (see below) in the income statement, as a component of revenue, at the point
the flow of economic benefit becomes probable. This is considered to be the point at which the relevant generation is delivered and the
payment becomes contractually due.

Revenue from the sale of electricity and gas directly to business customers through our B2B Energy Supply businesses, Haven Power and
Opus Energy, is recognised on the supply of electricity or gas when a contract exists, supply has taken place, a quantifiable price has been
established or can be determined and the receivables are expected to be recovered at the point of sale. Energy supplied is measured based
upon metered consumption and contractual rates; however, where a supply has taken place but is not yet measured or billed, the revenue is
estimated based on consumption statistics and selling price estimates and is included as accrued income on the balance sheet.

Other revenues derived from the provision of services (for example, the supply of system support services, such as black start and frequency
response) to National Grid are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract. Most such contracts are for the delivery of
a service either continually or on an ad-hoc basis over a period of time and thus stage of completion is calculated with reference to the
amount of the contract term that has elapsed. Depending on the contract terms this approach may require judgement in estimating
probable future outcomes.

Other revenues derived from the sale of goods (for example, by-products from electricity generation such as ash and gypsum) are recognised
at the point the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer, typically at the point of delivery to the customer’s premises.

CfD payments
The Group is party to a Contract for Difference (CfD) with the Low Carbon Contracts Company (LCCC), a Government-owned entity
responsible for delivering elements of the Government’s Electricity Market Reform Programme. Under the contract, the Group makes or
receives payments in respect of electricity dispatched from a specific biomass-fuelled generating unit. The payment is calculated with
reference to a strike price of £100 per MWh. The base year for the strike price was 2012 and it increases each year in line with the UK
Consumer Price Index and changes in system balancing costs. The strike price at 31 December 2017 was £106 per MWh.

When market prices at the point of generation are above/below the strike price, the Group makes/receives an additional payment to/from
LCCC equivalent to the difference between the market power price at the point of dispatch and the strike price. Such payments are in
addition to amounts received from the sale of the power in the wholesale market and either increase or limit the total income from the power
dispatched from the relevant generating unit to the strike price in the CfD contract.

The year ended 31 December 2017 is the first full year of generation under the CfD contract, which commenced on 21 December 2016.

ROC sales
The generation and sale of ROCs is a key driver of the Group’s financial performance. The RO scheme started in April 2002 and places an
obligation on electricity suppliers to source an increasing proportion of their electricity from renewable sources. Under the RO, ROCs are
certificates issued to generators of renewable electricity which are then sold to suppliers to demonstrate that they have fulfilled their
obligations under the RO. ROCs are managed in compliance periods (CPs), running from April to March annually, CP1 commenced in April
2002. At 31 December 2017 we are in CP16.

To meet its obligations a supplier can either submit ROCs or pay the “buy-out” price at the end of the CP. The buy-out price was set at £30 per
ROC in CP1 and rises with inflation. The buy-out price in CP16 is £45.58. ROCs are typically procured in arm’s-length transactions with
renewable generators at a market price typically slightly lower than the buy-out price for that CP. At the end of the CP, the amounts collected
from suppliers paying the buy-out price form the “recycle fund”, which is distributed on a pro-rata basis to ROC generators.

The financial benefit of a ROC recognised in the income statement at the point of generation is thus comprised of two parts: the expected
value to be obtained in a sale transaction with a third party supplier and the expected recycle fund benefit to be received at the end of the
CP. See note 3.3 on page 140 for further details of ROCs generated and sold by our Power Generation business and those utilised by our B2B
Energy Supply business in the year.

2.4 REVIEW OF FIXED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT
Accounting policy
The Group reviews its fixed assets (or, where appropriate, groups of assets known as cash-generating units (CGUs)) whenever there is an
indication that an impairment loss may have been suffered. The Group assesses the existence of indicators of impairment annually. The
Group considers the smallest collections of assets that generate independent cash flows to be its operating entities (Drax Power, Haven
Power, Opus Energy and Drax Biomass) and accordingly considers the Group to be comprised of four CGUs.

If an indication of potential impairment exists, the recoverable amount of the asset or CGU in question is assessed with reference to the
present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the continuing use of the asset or CGU (value in use) or the expected
price that would be received to sell the asset to another market participant (fair value less costs to sell). The initial assessment of recoverable
amount is normally based on value in use.

Where value in use is calculated, the assessment of future cash flows is based on the most recent approved business plan and includes all of
the necessary costs expected to be incurred to generate the cash inflows from the CGU’s assets in their current state and condition,
including an allocation of centrally managed costs. Central costs are only allocated where they are necessary for and directly attributable to
the CGU’s activities. Future cash flows include, where relevant, contracted cash flows arising from our cash flow hedging activities and as a
result the carrying amount of each CGU includes the mark-to-market value of those cash flow hedges.

**SECTION 2: FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE**

2.4 REVIEW OF FIXED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT CONTINUED
The additional value that could be obtained from enhancing or converting the Group’s assets is not reflected, nor the potential benefit of any
future restructuring or reorganisation. In determining value in use, the estimate of future cash flows is discounted to present value using a
pre-tax rate reflecting the specific risks attributable to the CGU in question.

If the recoverable amount is less than the current carrying amount in the financial statements, a provision is made to reduce the carrying
amount of the asset or CGU to the estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised immediately in the income statement.

Goodwill balances are assessed for impairment annually (see note 5.2).

Assessment of indicators of impairment
The Group's market capitalisation has remained below the carrying value of its net assets this year. As part of the most recent annual review,
the Group considered this and concluded that a potential indicator of impairment existed in respect of the Drax Power CGU. This assessment
was based upon continued weakness in commodity markets, volatility in foreign exchange rates, perceived levels of regulatory uncertainty
and the sensitivity of the recoverable amount of Drax Power's assets to changes in these factors.

Accordingly, an impairment review of the Drax Power CGU was undertaken at the balance sheet date. A review of other CGUs suggested no
indicators of impairment.

Significant estimation uncertainty
The assessment of the present value of future cash flows on which such a review is based is dependent upon a number of assumptions. In
particular, expected future cash flows are based upon management’s estimates of future prices, output, costs, economic support for
renewable energy generation and access to contracts for electricity generation and supply. Where relevant and to the fullest extent possible,
the key assumptions are based on observable market information. However, observable market information is only available for a limited
proportion of the remaining useful lives of the assets under review.

Impairment review
The carrying amount of the Drax Power CGU at 31 December 2017 was £1,430 million. The value in use of the Drax Power CGU was tested
using the Group’s established planning model.

The analysis assumed that Drax Power’s three biomass-fuelled generating units will continue in operation until the end of their estimated
useful lives, currently considered to be 2039. In line with our assumption that coal-fired generation will cease by 2025, applied in light of the
Government's announced intention to close coal-fired generation following recent consultations, the three remaining coal-fired units were
assumed to cease coal-fired generation by this date but will then be available for conversion to alternative fuels. No account has been taken
of any cash inflows that could result from such a conversion (which could take place earlier than 2025) in measuring the value in use of the
Drax Power CGU. This includes potential cash flows arising from the fourth unit conversion to biomass and possible repowering of the fifth
and sixth units to gas.

The analysis depends on a broad range of assumptions, including the expected life of the six power generating units and the regulatory
regime under which they might operate. The key assumptions (i.e. those most sensitive to a change, possibly resulting in a different outcome
for impairment) are considered to be:

– the expected operating lives of the six generating units, as described above;
– future commodity prices beyond the horizon of our existing contracted purchase and sale commitments – notably power prices and
biomass prices;
– future foreign exchange rates beyond the horizon of our existing contracted purchase commitments; and
– the continuance of existing biomass support regimes – CfD and RO – until 2027 and the existence of a favourable economic environment
for biomass generation thereafter. This includes future capacity market and system support revenues.

These assumptions are all dependent on external market movements. The historic volatility in these assumptions is reflected in the financial
performance of the Group but past performance is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future values.

Where available, estimates of future prices are based on signed contracts for purchases and sales with third parties. Intra-group purchases
of biomass are included at contract prices which are based on our view of future market prices. Transactions beyond contracted positions
are valued using market data and forward price curves, based where possible on data points provided by a reputable third party source,
independent to the Group. In particular, longer-term power prices are based on assumptions from Aurora Energy Research. The contracted
period for biomass purchases is substantially longer, with the longest-dated contracts expiring in 2027. Beyond this point, estimated biomass
prices are largely based on our internal models which reflect our assessment of future market prices.

Future foreign exchange rates are based on contracted foreign currency purchases to the extent possible. Beyond our contracted position,
exchange rate estimates are based on market forward curves.

Current Government plans for existing renewable support mechanisms, namely the CfD and RO, assume these cease in 2027. The
impairment analysis made no assumptions regarding the direct replacement of these support mechanisms beyond this date. The biomassfuelled units that are assumed to continue to generate power do so supported by the prevailing wholesale power price, delivery of ancillary
services to the UK grid and an expectation that capacity market revenues will be available to these units. Our power price forecasts reflect
increased volatility between peak and baseload prices Assumed revenues from ancillary services and the capacity market are based on


-----

2.4 REVIEW OF FIXED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT CONTINUED
reflect our expectation that Drax will be required to provide generation to support intermittent renewable power and be an essential part of
the UK’s energy mix throughout the life of the units.

The expected future cash flows were discounted using a pre-tax nominal rate of 7.3%. The discount rate is supported by observable market
reports and independent analysis commissioned by, and specific to the circumstances of, the Group and the Power Generation business. This
indicated that the recoverable amount of the Drax Power CGU exceeded its carrying value and therefore that no provisions for impairment
were required.

Sensitivity analysis indicated that, when compared to our base case assumptions, a reduction of approximately 21% in market power prices,
an increase in biomass prices of approximately 31%, or a depreciation of Sterling against the US Dollar of approximately 24% throughout the
22-year term of the valuation would result in a recoverable amount for the Drax Power CGU that is lower than its carrying amount.
Furthermore, the valuation includes cash flows for the period from 2027–2039 in line with the assumed useful economic lives of the assets.
If the value from this period was removed in its entirety, it would not result in an impairment charge. The analysis does not consider the
interaction effect of potential changes in several or all of the assumptions simultaneously, and the sensitivities do not take account of any
mitigating actions that could be taken should the changes referred to materialise. In addition, in relation to central costs, no reasonable
change in the method of allocation would result in an impairment charge.

2.5 NET FINANCE COSTS
Finance costs reflect expenses incurred in managing our debt structure (such as interest payable on our bonds) as well as foreign exchange
gains and losses, the unwinding of discounting on provisions for reinstatement of our sites at the end of their useful lives (see note 5.4) and
net interest charged on the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme obligation (see note 6.3). These are offset by interest income that we
generate through efficient use of short-term cash surpluses – for example through investment in money market funds.

On 5 May 2017, the Group refinanced its external debt. The resulting cost of £24.2 million (2016: £nil) reflects the costs incurred to extinguish
the existing debt together with the release of the related deferred borrowing costs. As described in note 2.7, these costs have been excluded
from the calculation of underlying earnings. Further information about the new finance structure can be found in note 4.3.

Foreign exchange gains and losses recognised in interest arise on the retranslation of non-derivative balances and investments
denominated in foreign currencies to prevailing rates at the balance sheet date. Sterling strengthened against the US Dollar and Euro
during 2017, resulting in losses being recognised on assets the Group holds denominated in these currencies.

**SECTION 2: FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE**

2.6 CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAXATION
The tax charge includes both current and deferred tax. Current tax is the estimated amount of tax payable on this year’s taxable profits
(which are adjusted for items upon which we are not required to pay tax or, in some cases, for items which are not allowable for tax purposes
and therefore on which we are required to pay additional tax) and adjusted for estimates for previous years. Deferred tax is an accounting
adjustment which reflects where more or less tax is expected to arise in the future due to differences between the accounting and tax rules
(reflected in differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and the corresponding tax bases used in
the computation of taxable profits). The tax credit reflects the estimated effective tax rate on the loss before tax for the Group for the year
ended 31 December 2017 and the movement in the deferred tax balance in the year, so far as it relates to items recognised in the income
statement.

Accounting policy
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is based on the taxable profit or loss for the year in the relevant jurisdiction. Taxable
profit or loss differs from profit/loss before tax as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expenditure that
are either taxable or deductible in other years or never taxable/deductible. The Group’s liability (or asset) for current tax is provided at
amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance
sheet date.

Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally
recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits
will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.

Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive
income or directly in equity, in which case the current and deferred tax are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity
respectively.

Significant estimation uncertainty
In accounting for taxation the Group makes assumptions regarding the treatment of items of income and expenditure for tax purposes. The
Group believes that these assumptions are reasonable based on prior experience and consultation with advisers. Full provision is made for
deferred taxation at the rates of tax prevailing at the period end date unless future rates have been substantively enacted. Deferred tax
assets are recognised where it is considered more likely than not that they will be recovered. Where such assets relate to losses incurred by a
business unit, particularly one with a history of losses, the Group seeks evidence other than its own internal forecasts to support recognition
of the related deferred tax asset.

UK corporation tax is the main rate of tax for the Group and is calculated at 19.25% (2016: 20%) of the assessable profit or loss for the year.
Tax for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on
jurisdictional tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. In December 2017, US Tax
Reforms were legislated and introduced a package of tax measures, including a reduction in the US federal tax rate from 35% to 21% from
January 2018. This rate reduction has been reflected in the US deferred tax balances at 31 December 2017. We do not anticipate any other
impact of the US Tax Reforms on the deferred tax balances.

Total tax (credit)/charge (32.1) 3.2

The Group’s underlying effective tax rate is sensitive to the mix of operating results between our UK and US businesses and the tax rates
which apply in those jurisdictions. However, as a result of the reduction in the US federal tax rates from 2018 to 21%, and tax relief now arising
to the group from the UK Patent Box regime (see below), in the medium term we anticipate our group underlying effective tax rate to be
marginally lower than the main rate of corporation tax in the UK. The adjustments in respect of prior periods principally relate to a Patent Box
claim. Drax Power was granted a patent to protect certain intellectual property it owns and which attaches to the technology developed to
manage the combustion process in generating electricity from biomass. Under UK tax legislation the Company is now entitled to apply a
lower rate of tax to some of its profits each year which are derived from utilisation of that technology. The Company has agreed a claim with
HMRC for tax relief covering the period from the patent application in 2013 to 2016 amounting to £10.4 million. In line with the policy
intentions of IFRIC 23 “Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments”, the Group has also recognised an estimated benefit from the tax regime for
the financial year 2017 of £2.6 million (included in the “Other” line in the table above). The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities

**SECTION 2: FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE**

2.6 CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAXATION CONTINUED
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to do so, otherwise they are shown separately in
the balance sheet.

Within the above deferred tax balances is a net deferred tax asset of £22.7 million in relation to start-up losses and other temporary
differences in the US-based Pellet Production business. Based on its business plan and reflecting continuing improvement in operational
performance, the Group anticipates generating sufficient profits in future periods against which to utilise this asset.

2.7 UNDERLYING EARNINGS
Following the announcement of the change in the Group's dividend policy on 15 June 2017, there is no longer a link between underlying
earnings and the calculation of distributions. We have continued to present underlying earnings, an alternative performance measure
(see page 120), to provide a consistent, comparable measure of the overall financial performance of the Group year-on-year.

Underlying earnings is defined as profit after tax, as measured in accordance with IFRS, adjusted to exclude unrealised gains and losses on
derivative contracts and material one-off items that do not reflect the underlying performance of the business.

This note analyses the items which are included in our results for the year but are excluded from underlying earnings:

– Unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts: calculated in accordance with IAS 39 on derivative contracts not designated into
hedge relationships for accounting purposes but held for the purposes of de-risking future cash flows (see note 7.2), excluded due to their
inherent volatility which does not reflect current operational performance.
– Acquisition-related costs: material one-off costs associated with the acquisition and integration of Opus Energy during 2017.
– Cost of debt restructure: material one-off costs incurred as part of the restructuring of the Group's debt in May 2017.
– In 2016, deferred tax on start-up losses and other temporary differences: a material one-off credit arising from the recognition of a
deferred tax asset relating to the Pellet Production business.

2.8 EARNINGS PER SHARE AND UNDERLYING EARNINGS PER SHARE
Earnings per share (EPS) represents the amount of our earnings (post-tax profits) that is attributable to each ordinary share we have in issue.
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing our earnings (profit after tax calculated in accordance with IFRS) by the weighted average number of
ordinary shares that were in issue during the year. Diluted EPS demonstrates the impact if all outstanding share options (such as those to be
issued under our employee share schemes – see note 6.2), that are expected to vest on their future maturity dates, were exercised and
treated as ordinary shares as at the balance sheet date.

In addition to EPS, we calculate underlying EPS. Underlying EPS is based upon underlying earnings as defined in note 2.7.

The effect of potentially dilutive options on the weighted average number of shares in issue at the balance sheet date is shown below:

As described on page 49, on 15 June 2017 we announced a new dividend policy.

At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting the Board will recommend to shareholders that a resolution is passed to approve payment of
a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2017 of 7.4 pence per share (equivalent to approximately £30 million) payable on or before
11 May 2018. The final dividend has not been included as a liability as at 31 December 2017. This would bring total dividends payable in respect
of the 2017 financial year to £50 million.

In future years, in determining the value of dividends the Board will take account of future investment opportunities and the less predictable
cash flows from the Group’s commodity based businesses. If there is a build-up of capital in excess of the Group’s investment needs the
Board will consider the most appropriate mechanism to return this to shareholders.

2.10 RETAINED PROFITS
Retained profits are a component of our equity reserves. The overall balance reflects the total profits we have generated over our lifetime,

Distributable profits
The capacity of the Group to make dividend payments is primarily determined by the availability of retained distributable profits and cash resources.

The immediate cash resources of the Group of £222.3 million are set out in note 4.2 and the recent history of cash generation within note
4.4. The majority of these cash resources are held centrally within the Group by Drax Corporate Limited. The Parent Company financial
statements, set out on pages 172–177 of this report, disclose the Parent Company’s distributable reserves of £229.7 million. Sufficient
reserves are available across the Group as a whole to make future distributions in accordance with the Group’s updated dividend policy for
the foreseeable future.

The majority of the Group’s distributable reserves are held in holding and operating subsidiaries. Management actively monitors the level of
distributable reserves in each company in the Group, ensuring adequate reserves are available for upcoming dividend payments and that the
Parent Company has access to these reserves.

The Group's new financing facilities (see note 4.3) place certain conditions on the value of dividend payments to be made in any given year.
We expect to be able to make dividend payments, in line with our new policy, within these conditions for the foreseeable future.

SECTION 3
### Operating assets and working capital

This section gives further information on the operating assets we use to generate revenue and the short-term liquid assets and liabilities,
managed during day-to-day operations, that comprise our working capital balances.

3.1 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
This note shows the cost, depreciation and net book value of the physical assets controlled by us that we use in our businesses to generate
revenue. The cost of an asset is what we paid to purchase or construct the asset. Depreciation reflects the usage of the asset over time and
is calculated by taking the cost of the asset, net of any residual value, to the income statement evenly over the useful economic life of the
asset. An asset’s net book value is its cost less any depreciation (including impairment, if required) charged to date.

On 13 April 2017, the Group acquired the wood pellet manufacturing plant owned by Louisiana Pellets Inc, for consideration of $35 million
(£27.4 million). The assets of the plant were acquired at auction through a bankruptcy court and did not constitute a business in their own
right. At the point of acquisition, the plant was not operational, there was no workforce in place and no raw material contracts for it to
operate as a business. In accordance with the requirements of IFRS 3 – Business combinations, the acquisition has been accounted for as an
asset purchase. Since the date of acquisition, further costs totalling £20.4 million have been capitalised and the plant is expected to begin
commercial operations in 2018.

Accounting policy
Property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost. Cost comprises the purchase price (after deducting trade discounts and
rebates), any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the
manner intended by management, and the estimate of the present value of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the
site. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment in value.

We construct many of our assets as part of long-term development projects. Assets that are in the course of construction are not
depreciated until they are ready for us to use in the way intended.

Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write down assets to their residual value evenly over the estimated useful lives (UEL) of the
assets from the date of acquisition (where relevant, limited to the expected decommissioning date of the power station – currently expected
to be 2039). The table below shows the range of useful lives at the date of acquisition and the average remaining useful life at the balance
sheet date of the main categories of asset we own in years:

Average UEL Range of
remaining UELs

Freehold buildings 20 8–33

Plant and equipment

Electricity generation plant 14 3–33

Biomass-specific assets 20 4–26

Coal-specific assets 6 3–19

Pellet production plant 19 5–20

Other plant, machinery and equipment 13 3–33

Decommissioning asset 22 35

Plant spare parts 22 Up to 35

Freehold land held at cost is considered to have an unlimited useful life and is not depreciated.

Electricity generation plant refers to core electricity generation assets at Drax Power Station which are fuel agnostic. Biomass-specific and
coal-specific assets are those assets that are only necessary to support electricity generation from the specified fuel and include fuel
storage and distribution systems.

Within the plant and equipment categories shorter lives are attributed to components that are overhauled and upgraded as part of rolling
outage cycles. The majority of assets within these categories have a remaining useful life in excess of 15 years.

Plant spare parts are depreciated over the remaining useful life of the power station.

Costs relating to major inspections, overhauls and upgrades to the power station are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised
as a separate asset, as appropriate, if the recognition criteria are met; namely, when it is probable that future economic benefits associated
with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed
as incurred.

Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually, taking into account regulatory change and commercial and technological
obsolescence as well as normal wear and tear. Residual values are based on prices prevailing at each balance sheet date. Any changes are
applied prospectively.


-----

3.1 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT CONTINUED
Significant estimation uncertainty
Asset lives are reviewed annually at each balance sheet date. The estimated useful lives of coal-specific assets at Drax Power Station have
been revised with effect from 1 January 2017 as a result of the Government’s announcement that all coal generation will be closed during
2025. Having considered this event, the Group concluded that coal generation will cease during 2025, but that the three existing coal units
will be retained for conversion to alternative fuels in the period to 2039. This results in the useful lives of the coal-specific assets which will
not be required to support generation after this date being shortened to no later than 2025. This change has been applied prospectively,
from 1 January 2017, and has resulted in an increase of approximately £15 million per annum in depreciation charges in 2017 compared to
2016, which will recur in each year until 2025. The useful lives of electricity generation plant currently fuelled by biomass are unaffected by
this change. No further changes to the useful economic lives of assets have been made as a result of the most recent review.

At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews its property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that these
assets may be impaired. The Group's accounting policy in respect of impairment, along with details of the impairment review conducted
during 2017, are set out in note 2.4.

**SECTION 3: OPERATING ASSETS AND WORKING CAPITAL**

3.1 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT CONTINUED
Reflecting continued investment in the Group's IT software systems and the increasing significance of the value of such assets as a result, IT
software assets have been presented as a component of intangible assets from 2017 (see note 5.3). As a result of this change in presentation,
assets with a net book value of £14.4 million previously presented in property, plant and equipment have been transferred in this period.

Issues and transfers reflect changes in the categorisation of assets during the period, or the issue of spare parts for use in repair and
maintenance projects. When spares are utilised in such projects, the cost of the part is transferred from the property, plant and equipment
balance and recognised as an expense in the income statement within operating costs.

Losses on disposal in the income statement of £15.4 million include £3.6 million relating to the disposal of Billington Bioenergy on 31 October
2017.

3.2 OTHER FIXED ASSET INVESTMENTS
During 2017, the Group acquired 1.6 million shares in Aggregated Micro Power Holdings plc (AMPH) as part-consideration for the disposal of
Billington Bioenergy. AMPH is an AIM-listed energy company specialising in the sale of wood fuels and the development of distributed energy
assets, including biomass boilers and battery storage. Through its shareholding in AMPH, the Group retains an interest in the UK heating
market, whilst gaining exposure to the development of small-scale distributed energy assets.

Accounting policy
Other investments are recognised at fair value, based on quoted market prices, at the date of transfer. The assets are classified at fair value
through profit and loss in accordance with IAS 39. Subsequent movements in the fair value are recognised in the income statement.

3.3 ROC ASSETS
We earn Renewable Obligation Certificate (ROC) assets, which are accredited by the Office for Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem), as a
result of burning sustainable compressed wood pellets to generate electricity. This note sets out the value of these assets that we have
earned but not yet sold.

Total ROC generation has reduced in 2017, compared to previous periods, following the approval of the CfD contract for one of our biomassfuelled units in December 2016, which was previously supported by the ROC regime. Haven Power and Opus Energy provide us with a
credit-efficient and timely route to market for these ROCs.

Accounting policy
ROCs are recognised as current assets in the period they are generated and are initially measured at fair value based on anticipated sales
prices. The value of ROCs earned is recognised in the income statement as a reduction in fuel costs in that period.

Where our B2B Energy Supply electricity sales incur an obligation to deliver ROCs to Ofgem, that obligation is provided for in the period
incurred.

At each reporting date the Group reviews the fair value of ROC assets generated but not sold against updated anticipated sales prices
including, where relevant, agreed forward sale contracts and taking into account likely utilisation of ROCs generated to settle our own
ROC obligations. Any impairments required are recognised in the income statement in the period incurred.


-----

3.3 ROC ASSETS CONTINUED
Significant estimation uncertainty
The fair values and net realisable values of ROCs referred to above are calculated with reference to assumptions regarding future sales prices
in the market, taking into account agreed forward sale contracts where appropriate. Historic experience indicates that the assumptions
used in the valuation are reasonable; however, actual sales prices may differ from those assumed.

ROC valuations also include an estimate of the future benefit that may be obtained from the ROC recycle fund at the end of the compliance
period. The recycle fund provides a benefit where supplier buy-out charges (incurred by suppliers who do not procure sufficient ROCs to
satisfy their obligations) are returned to renewable generators on a pro-rata basis. The estimate is based on assumptions about likely levels
of renewable generation and supply over the compliance period and is thus subject to some uncertainty. The Group utilises external sources
of information in addition to its own forecasts in making these estimates. Past experience indicates that the values arrived at are reasonable
but they remain subject to possible variation.

3.4 INVENTORIES
We hold stocks of fuels and other consumable items that we use in the process of generating electricity, and raw materials used in the
production of compressed wood pellets. This note shows the cost of coal, biomass, other fuels and plant consumables that we held at the
end of the year, including items at Drax Power Station, our facilities in the US and those owned by us but stored in off-site locations.

Accounting policy
Our raw materials and fuel stocks are valued at the lower of the weighted average cost to purchase and net realisable value.

The cost of fuel stocks includes all direct costs and overheads incurred in bringing the fuel to its present location and condition, including the
purchase price, import duties and other taxes (including amounts levied on coal under the UK carbon price support mechanism) and
transport/ handling costs.

Both coal and biomass stocks are weighed when entering, moving within or exiting our sites using technology regularly calibrated to industry
standards. Fuel burn in the electricity generation process is calculated using a combination of weights and thermal efficiency calculations to
provide closing stock volumes. Both calibrated weighers and efficiency calculations are subject to a range of tolerable error. All fuel
inventories are subject to regular surveys to ensure accuracy of these measurements.

Coal stocks are verified by an independent stock survey carried out by a suitably trained specialist, and a provision is made where the survey
indicates a lower level of stock than indicated by the methods described above. Despite being an independent process, the survey depends
on estimates and assumptions and as a result actual values may differ.

The characteristics of biomass require specialist handling and storage. On-site biomass at Drax Power Station is stored in sealed domes with
a carefully controlled atmosphere for fire prevention purposes and thus cannot be surveyed using traditional methods. Biomass stock is
surveyed using regularly calibrated state-of-the-art RADAR scanning technology.

(2016: £2.3 million) and £0.1 million of work in progress (2016: £2.0 million) in our Pellet Production business.

The cost of inventories recognised as an expense in the year ended 31 December 2017 was £1,285.8 million (2016: £1,173.5 million).

3.5 TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES
Trade receivables represent amounts owed to us by our customers for goods or services we have provided but not yet been paid for. Other
receivables include accrued income, which is income earned in the period but not yet invoiced, largely in respect of power delivered that will
be invoiced the following month, and prepayments, which are amounts paid by the Group for which we are yet to receive the relevant goods
or services in return (e.g. insurance premiums relating to periods after the balance sheet date).

Accounting policy
Trade and other receivables, given their short tenor, are measured at cost. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established
where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivable.

Amounts falling due within one year:

Trade receivables 125.7 87.0

Accrued income 209.0 100.0

Prepayments and other receivables 82.8 105.9

417.5 292.9

Trade receivables and accrued income principally represent sales of energy to counterparties within both our Power Generation and B2B
Energy Supply businesses. At 31 December 2017, the Group had amounts receivable from five (2016: four) significant counterparties
representing 20% (2016: 46%) of total trade receivables and accrued income.

The increase in trade receivables and accrued income is principally the result of Opus Energy joining the Group in 2017.

Of total trade and other receivables at 31 December 2017, £123.9 million (2016: £33.4 million) relates to B2B Energy Supply sales. The risk
profile of B2B Energy Supply debt is different from that of the Power Generation business due to a larger volume of smaller counterparties,
and therefore a lower concentration of credit risk, with different payment terms.

The Group does not consider there to be any requirement for further provisions in excess of the provision for doubtful debts of £28.2 million
(2016: £4.0 million). This provision, which largely relates to B2B Energy Supply receivables, has been determined with reference to past
default experiences in line with our policies. Credit and counterparty risk are both discussed in further detail in note 7.1.

All past-due receivables are assessed against the Group’s credit risk policies for indicators of impairment and provisions made where
appropriate.

The movement in the allowance for doubtful debts is laid out in the following table:

-----

3.5 TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES CONTINUED
The customer base of Opus Energy is comprised of a large number of smaller enterprises. Accordingly, Opus Energy carries lower
concentrations but higher levels of credit risk compared to the rest of the Group. This is reflected in the increase of the allowance for
doubtful debts acquired when the Group obtained control of Opus Energy.

The value of trade receivables that are past due and not provided against, in accordance with the assessment described above, is
£32.2 million (2016: £3.6 million). An ageing analysis of this amount is provided in the table below:

3.6 TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES
Trade and other payables represent amounts we owe to our suppliers (for goods and services provided), tax authorities and other creditors
that are due to be paid in the ordinary course of business. We make accruals for amounts that will fall due for payment in the future as a
result of our activities in the current year (e.g. fuel we have received but for which we have not yet been invoiced).

Energy supply accruals includes £225.0 million (2016: £166.0 million) in relation to the Group’s obligation to deliver ROCs arising from B2B
Energy Supply activities. The remaining balance principally comprises third party grid charge accruals of £36.8 million (2016: £26.5 million)
and FiT accruals of £25.9 million (2016: 21.2 million).

The Group recognises a liability in respect of its unsettled obligations to deliver emissions allowances under the EU Emission Trading Scheme
(ETS). Accruals at 31 December 2017 include £30.6 million (2016: £2.8 million) with respect to the Group’s estimated net liability to deliver CO2
emissions allowances. Allowances are purchased in the market and are recorded at cost.

At 31 December 2017, the amounts payable in respect of acquisitions reflect the contingent consideration payable in relation to the
acquisition of four Open-Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) projects in 2016. Initial consideration of £18.6 million was settled in cash on 3 January
2017, with the amount held as a liability in the balance sheet at 31 December 2016. The final purchase price depends upon future clearing
prices in T-4 capacity market auctions from 2016 to 2020. The range of possible outcomes being zero further consideration if the capacity
market clearing price does not exceed £28/KW in these auctions, with a maximum contingent consideration payable of £72 million, based
on a clearing price of £75/KW. The fair value of the contingent consideration at 31 December 2017 was assessed at £4.1 million (2016:
£3.8 million) based on a projection of likely future capacity market clearing prices, discounted to present value at a risk-free rate of 2%.

SECTION 4
### Financing and capital structure

This section gives further information regarding the Group’s capital structure (equity and debt financing) and cash generated from
operations during the year.

4.1 RECONCILIATION OF NET DEBT
Net debt is calculated by taking our borrowings (note 4.3) and subtracting cash and cash equivalents (note 4.2). The table below reconciles
net debt in terms of changes in these balances across the year.

4.3 BORROWINGS
On 10 February 2017, the Group entered into a £375 million acquisition finance facility, of which £200 million was drawn and utilised in the
purchase of Opus Energy (see note 5.1). This facility, along with the existing term loans at 1 January 2017, was repaid in full on 5 May 2017,
when the Group undertook a refinancing exercise.

The new financing structure consists of £550 million of high-yield, publicly traded bonds listed on the Luxembourg exchange. This includes
£350 million 4.25% fixed rate notes and £200 million floating rate notes of 4.00% above LIBOR, which all mature in April 2022.

On the same day, the Group entered into a £350 million Facility comprised of a revolving credit facility (RCF) with a value of £315 million (2016:
£400 million) and an index-linked term loan of £35 million.

The RCF matures in April 2021, with an option to extend by one year, and has a margin of 150 basis points over LIBOR. At 31 December 2017,
the RCF had been utilised to draw down letters of credit with a total value of £35.7 million (2016: 57.9 million).

The Group also has access to a $25 million revolving 30 day facility in the US business. This facility was fully drawn down at 31 December
2017 and had a Sterling equivalent value of £18.5 million at that date.

The term loan was fully drawn at inception and remains fully drawn at 31 December 2017 (2016: term loans of £325 million fully drawn).

The Group has no other undrawn debt facilities, although it does have access to certain non-recourse trade receivable finance facilities as
described on note 4.4 which are utilised to accelerate working capital cash flows.

Accounting policy
The Group measures all debt instruments (whether financial assets or financial liabilities) initially at fair value, which equates to the principal
value of the consideration paid or received. Subsequent to initial measurement, debt instruments are measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method. Transaction costs (any such costs incremental and directly attributable to the issue of the financial instrument)
are included in the calculation of the effective interest rate and are amortised through the income statement over the life of the instrument.

Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or
all of the facility will be drawn down. Where this is the case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs.

The borrowings from the refinancing exercise in May, including the term loan, the loan notes and the RCF are secured against the assets of a
number of the Group’s subsidiaries, with the exception of the US subsidiary’s land and buildings.

In addition, the Group has a secured commodity trading line, which allows us to transact prescribed volumes of commodity trades without
the requirement to post collateral and FX trading lines with certain banks. Counterparties to these arrangements are entitled to share in the
security as described above. As at 31 December 2017, this value was £3.6 million (2016: £0.9 million).

The US revolving facility is unsecured.

Cash generated from operations 375.7 213.1

Note:
(1) During 2016 we closed out a number of in-the-money forward foreign currency purchase contracts with a total value of £14 million. As these contracts were designated into hedge accounting
relationships under IAS 39, the benefit is being recognised in the income statement in the period the hedged transaction occurs. The net loss for 2017 includes £10 million of income in relation to the
unwinding of this position, for which the cash was received in 2016.

The Group has access to a facility that enables it to accelerate the cash flows associated with trade receivables arising from B2B Energy
Supply sales on a non-recourse basis. The net cash benefit derived from this facility during 2017 was £110 million (2016: £74 million) and is
recognised as a reduction in receivables in the table above. We estimate that approximately 30% of this cash would have been received in
the ordinary course of business by 31 December 2017 had the facility not been in place.

The Group also has access to similar non-recourse facilities to accelerate cash flows on ROC receivables. No ROC receivables have been sold
through these facilities in 2017 (2016: net cash benefit of £111 million). The reduction in ROCs in the table above reflects a reduction in the
number of generation units that give rise to ROCs following the approval of the CfD contract for one of our biomass-fuelled units in
December 2016.


-----

4.5 EQUITY AND RESERVES
Our ordinary share capital reflects the total number of shares in issue, which are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange.

Accounting policy
Ordinary shares are classified as equity as evidenced by their residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting its liabilities.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the
proceeds.

This section provides information on the assets and liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheet that are not covered in other sections,
including goodwill, other intangible assets and the provision for reinstatement.

5.1 ACQUISITIONS
Accounting policy
Acquisitions of businesses are recognised at the point the Group obtains control of the target (the acquisition date). The consideration
transferred and the assets and liabilities acquired are measured at their fair value on the acquisition date. The assets and liabilities acquired
are recognised in the Consolidated balance sheet and the profits of the acquired business are recognised in the Consolidated income
statement from the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement in the period the acquisition occurs
in the transaction costs line. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the
identifiable net assets acquired.

Acquisition of Opus Energy Group Limited (Opus Energy)
The acquisition of Opus Energy was approved by shareholders on 8 February 2017 and subsequently completed on 10 February 2017; the
Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital on this date.

Opus Energy is a well-established B2B energy supply business serving business customers principally in the SME market, providing
diversification of our retail offering and a robust platform for growth in line with our strategy. Opus Energy has contributed positively to
earnings and cash flow immediately following the acquisition.

The purchase consideration was £340 million plus interest calculated on the amount of Opus Energy’s net assets from 31 March 2016 to
the acquisition date. The total consideration of £367 million was funded by a combination of existing cash reserves (£167 million) and partial
drawing of a £375 million acquisition facility (£200 million). This facility was repaid as part of the refinancing described in note 4.3.

Acquisition-related costs amounted to £7.8 million.

Following a detailed exercise to review the assets and liabilities, including intangible assets, the fair values acquired were as follows:

Opus Energy
£m

Financial assets 213.3

Property, plant and equipment 6.7

Financial liabilities (195.4)

Intangible assets

Customer-related assets 211.0

Brand 11.3

Software 1.9

Total identifiable intangible assets 224.2

Deferred tax liability (40.7)

Total identifiable net assets 208.1

Goodwill 159.2

Fair value of consideration payable 367.3

The revenue and results of Opus Energy from the date of acquisition to the year end were as follows:

Income statement items for the period from 10 February to 31 December 2017

Revenue 610.7

EBITDA 28.9

Profit 22.5

The figures above have changed from those disclosed in the interim financial statements published on 19 July 2017. The Group has continued
to review and align estimates for the B2B Energy Supply business. This process resulted in a number of remeasurements reducing the fair
value of the net assets acquired by £4.4 million, with a corresponding increase in goodwill. The values shown above are now final.

Following the acquisition, the Group has been able to identify and measure the fair value of existing customer contracts, the Opus Energy
brand and software. The assets will be amortised over their useful economic lives as follows:

– Existing customer contracts 11 years (reducing balance)
– Brand 10 years (straight line)
– Software 3 years (straight line)


-----

5.1 ACQUISITIONS CONTINUED
The fair value measurement of the existing customer contracts requires assumptions to be made, in particular regarding margins on current
customer contracts, future contract renewal rates and future margins on renewed contracts. The goodwill of £159 million recognised on
acquisition is largely reflective of potential customer contracts and growth opportunities together with the assembled workforce. None of
the goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.

The financial assets acquired include £130 million of receivables, the majority of which reflect trade receivables for energy supplied to
customers. By virtue of their short tenor, the fair value of these receivables is considered to be the contractual amounts receivable less any
provision for doubtful debts. The provision for doubtful debts as at the acquisition date was £20 million.

Additional financial information
The consolidated results of the Group, assuming Opus Energy had been acquired at the beginning of the year, would show revenue of
£3,775.7 million (compared to reported revenue of £3,685.2 million), EBITDA of £231.6 million (compared to the reported EBITDA of £228.9
million) and a loss after taxation of £149.0 million (compared to a reported loss after taxation of £151.1 million). This information includes the
revenue and profits made by Opus Energy between 1 January 2017 and 10 February 2017, without accounting policy alignments and/or the
impact of fair value uplifts resulting from acquisition accounting adjustments. This information is not necessarily indicative of the results of
the combined Group that would have occurred had the acquisition actually been made at the beginning of the year, or indicative of the
future results of the combined Group.

5.2 GOODWILL
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of a business when the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the assets acquired. During 2017,
we recognised additional goodwill on the purchase of Opus Energy (see note 5.1), and wrote off goodwill of £3.8 million in respect of
Billington Bioenergy following the sale of the business.

Accounting policy
Goodwill is initially recognised and measured at the acquisition date. Goodwill is not amortised but reviewed for impairment at least annually.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the CGU to which it relates and the recoverable amount for that CGU
assessed. The table below shows movements and balances:

Goodwill
£m

Cost and carrying amount:

At 1 January 2016, 31 December 2016 and 1 January 2017 14.5

Acquisition of Opus Energy 159.2

Disposal of Billington Bioenergy (3.8)

At 31 December 2017 169.9

Goodwill
Total goodwill in the Consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2017 was £170 million, with £11 million arising on the acquisition of Haven
Power in 2009 attributed to the Haven Power CGU and £159 million arising on the acquisition of Opus Energy in the year (see note 5.1)
attributed to the Opus Energy CGU.

The recoverable amount of the Haven Power and Opus Energy CGUs is measured annually, based on a value-in-use calculation using the
Group's established planning model. The elements reflected in this calculation are the same as those used for the wider asset impairment
review conducted by the Group as at 31 December 2017 and are disclosed in note 2.4. Cash flows beyond the business plan period are
inflated into perpetuity using a growth rate of 1%.

The carrying amount of the Haven Power CGU at 31 December 2017 was £23 million. The expected future cash flows of the CGU were
discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 8.1% (calculated based on independent analysis commissioned by the Group, adjusted to the
specific circumstances and risk factors affecting the Group's B2B Energy Supply business). We believe that this rate reflects the prospects
for a well-established B2B Energy Supply business. The value in use of the Haven Power CGU, including the goodwill, was significantly in
excess of its carrying amount.

The carrying amount of the Opus Energy CGU at 31 December 2017 was £366 million, including intangible assets with a net book value of
£186 million as described in note 5.3. Following the acquisition in 2017, the appropriate discount rate was assessed as being higher for Opus
Energy than for Haven Power. The expected future cash flows were discounted using a range of discount rates from the Group's central B2B
Energy Supply assumption (8.1%) to the rate used in the valuation of Opus Energy at the acquisition date (10.7% – see note 5.3). The
application of discount rates across this range does not result in a recoverable amount for Opus Energy below its carrying amount.

The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis of the estimates of future cash flows of each CGU. This analysis indicates that any reasonably
possible change in the key assumptions, which are customer margins and supply volumes, would not cause an impairment loss in respect of
goodwill.

**SECTION 5: OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES**

5.3 INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets are not physical in nature but are identifiable and separable from other assets. Intangible assets can be acquired in
business combinations (such as the acquisition of Opus Energy during 2017) or purchased separately. The Group routinely purchases
computer software and carbon emissions allowances, which are considered intangible assets.

Accounting policy
Intangibles acquired in business combinations are measured at fair value on the acquisition date. Other intangible assets are measured at
cost. Cost comprises the purchase price (net of any discount or rebate) and any directly attributable costs to bring the asset into the
condition and location required for use as intended by management.

Intangible assets are amortised over their anticipated useful lives. Useful lives are reviewed at each balance sheet date. No changes to useful
lives were made as at 31 December 2017. Amortisation calculations are specific to each category of assets and are explained in further detail
below.

Carrying amounts are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. The customer-related assets and brand are
attributed to the Opus Energy CGU and details of the impairment test relating to this CGU are included in note 5.2.

Significant estimation uncertainty
The valuation of the intangible assets recognised on the acquisition of Opus Energy is dependent upon a number of assumptions. The most
significant of these assumptions are explained under each of the asset headings below.

-----

5.3 INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED
Customer-related assets
Customer-related assets reflect the value of customer contracts acquired on the acquisition of Opus Energy in February 2017, which
provided the Group with access to a broad customer base with contracted cash flows. The asset valuation of £211 million reflects the
estimated acquisition-date value of the future cash flows associated with this customer base and is dependent upon estimates of both
current and expected future contract margins and assumed customer retention rates. The cash flows have been discounted using a pre-tax
discount rate of 10.7%. The asset has a useful life of 11 years, calculated based on customer churn-rate analysis, and is being amortised on a
reducing balance basis to reflect the diminishing rate of contract renewals over time.

Opus Energy brand
The Opus Energy brand was acquired as part of the acquisition in February 2017 and valued at £11 million on a relief-from-royalty method.
The brand is being amortised on a straight-line basis over its assumed 10 year useful life.

Computer software
In light of continued investment and the increased significance of the carrying amount, the Group’s software assets are presented
separately within intangible assets (2016: included within tangible fixed assets, see note 3.1). Additions in the period include assets acquired
in the Opus Energy acquisition in addition to those in the ordinary course of business, which principally reflect ongoing investment in
business systems to support the B2B Energy Supply segment. Software assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over estimated useful
lives ranging between three and five years.

Computer software assets in the course of construction of £11.1 million at 31 December 2017 (2016: £nil) were capitalised in the year.

Development assets
The development assets arose on the acquisition of four Open Cycle Gas Turbine projects in December 2016 and reflect the value of planning
and consents acquired as part of that transaction. Until operations commence, the assets are considered to have an indefinite life and thus
are not amortised and will be subject to impairment testing at each balance sheet date.

At 31 December 2017, the recoverable amount of the development assets was established using a value-in-use calculation derived from the
Group's established planning model, consistent with the approach described in note 2.4. The assessment incorporated assumptions related
to likely capacity market clearing prices, construction costs, the ongoing revenues to be derived from the projects once constructed and the
direct costs of generating those revenues. The analysis indicated a recoverable amount for the development assets in excess of their
carrying amount.

Carbon assets
Carbon assets arise on the purchase of CO2 emissions allowances in excess of the amount allocated under the Emissions Trading Scheme
and required for the current financial year, and are measured at cost, net of any impairment. Given their short tenor, carbon assets are not
amortised.

The charge to the income statement, within fuel costs, reflects the cost of emissions allowances required to satisfy the obligation for the
current year and takes into account generation and market purchases allocated to the current financial year, and to the extent further
purchases are required, the market price at the balance sheet date.

Post balance sheet events
The 2021 T-4 capacity market auction closed in February 2018 at a clearing price of £8.40/KW. The Group secured agreements to provide a
total of 1,217MW of capacity from two existing coal units, worth a total of £10 million for the period October 2021 to September 2022.

Two of the Group’s Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) projects also participated in the auction but exited above the clearing price. The Group
will continue to develop these options with an expectation that they will go on to participate in the next T-4 auction. This outcome does not
change the Group’s view of the recoverable amount of the existing investments in the OCGT projects (see above) or the fair value of the
contingent consideration that may become payable following future capacity market outcomes (see note 3.6).

**SECTION 5: OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES**

5.4 PROVISIONS
We make provision for reinstatement to cover the estimated costs of decommissioning and demolishing our generation assets and
remediating the site at the end of the useful economic lives of the assets. The amount represents the present value of the expected costs.

Accounting policy
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the
Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

Specifically, provision is made for the estimated decommissioning costs at the end of the useful economic life of the Group’s generating
assets, when a legal or constructive obligation arises, on a discounted basis. The amount provided represents the present value of the
expected costs. In view of the uncertainty of assessing the amount of any proceeds from the disposal of the assets at the decommissioning
date, no reduction in the provision is made for any such proceeds. The discount rate used is a risk-free pre-tax rate of 1.8% (2016: 1.9%),
reflecting the fact that the estimated future cash flows have built-in risks specific to the liability. An amount equivalent to the discounted
provision is capitalised within property, plant and equipment and is depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets. The unwinding of
the discount is included in interest payable and similar charges. The balance also includes a small provision in respect of dilapidation
provisions for leased offices acquired in the Opus Energy transaction in 2017.

Additions 0.3

Acquisition of Opus Energy 0.3

Adjustment for changes in assumptions 0.1

Unwinding of discount 0.6

At 31 December 2017 36.3

The decommissioning provision is based on the assumption that the decommissioning and reinstatement will take place at the end of the
expected useful life of the power station in 2039, and has been estimated using existing technology at current prices based on independent
third-party advice, updated on a triennial basis. The most recent update took place in December 2017.

Post balance sheet events
Subsequent to the year end, on 8 February 2018 the Group announced its intention to close the headquarters of the Pellet Production
business in Atlanta, Georgia and move these functions to a location closer to the operational sites in Monroe, Louisiana. No amounts have
been included in respect of this decision in these financial statements.

SECTION 6
### Our people

The notes in this section relate to the remuneration of our directors and employees, including our obligations under retirement benefit
schemes.

6.1 EMPLOYEES AND DIRECTORS
This note provides a more detailed breakdown of the cost of our employees, including executive directors. The average number of employees
in Operations (staff based at production sites), B2B Energy Supply services (employees in our B2B Energy Supply segment) and Central and
administrative functions are also provided.

Further information in relation to pay and remuneration of the executive directors can be found in the report of the Remuneration
Committee, starting on page 81.

The number of staff employed by the Group, and the associated costs, increased from the previous year following the purchase of Opus
Energy and the expansion of our US-based Pellet Production business.

6.2 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
We operate two share option schemes for our employees – the Performance Share Plan (PSP) for directors and senior executives (which
replaced the Bonus Matching Plan (BMP) from 2017), and the Savings-Related Share Option Plan (SAYE) for all qualifying employees. We
incur a non-cash charge in respect of these schemes in our income statement, which is set out below along with a detailed description of
each scheme and the number of options outstanding.

Accounting policy
All of the Group’s share-based payments are equity settled. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at the fair value of the equity
instrument at the date of grant and are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the relevant vesting period, based
on an estimate of the shares that will ultimately vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions, which is revised at each
balance sheet date.

6.2 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED
Share Incentive Plan (SIP)
Between 2008 and 2010, qualifying employees could buy up to £1,500 worth of Partnership Shares in any one tax year. Matching shares
were awarded to employees to match any shares they bought, in a ratio of one-to-one, with the cost of matching shares borne by the Group.
There have been no awards under the SIP Partnership and Matching Share plan since 2010.

Shares in the Company held under trust and under the Company’s control as a result of the SIP were as follows:

2017 Performance Share Plan (PSP) and Deferred Share Plan (DSP)
In 2017, a new share plan was introduced for directors and senior executives, replacing the Bonus Matching Plan. Under the PSP, annual
awards of performance and service-related shares are made for no consideration to executive directors and other senior executives up to a
maximum of 175% of their annual bonus. Vesting of a proportion of shares is conditional upon whether the Group’s Total Shareholder Return
(TSR) matches or outperforms an index (determined in accordance with the scheme rules) over three years and vesting of a proportion of
shares is conditional upon performance against the internal balanced corporate scorecard. The fair value of the 2017 PSP awards of
£2.8 million is being charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the three-year vesting period.

The fair value of PSP awards is calculated using a Monte-Carlo valuation model, which takes into account the estimated probability of
different levels of vesting. The key inputs to the valuation model for the 2017 awards are the share price at the grant date (325 pence),
expected volatility (44%), and risk-free interest rate (0.13%).

In addition, the Group operates the DSP, which was introduced in 2017 as a vehicle for deferring 35% of the annual bonus of executive
directors, which are granted at nil cost and vest after three years subject to continued employment or “good leaver” termination provisions.
The share price on the grant date of DSP awards made in 2017 was 325 pence and the fair value of these awards of £0.6 million is being
charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the three-year vesting period.

Movements in the number of share options outstanding for the PSP and DSP awards are as follows:

At 31 December 1,289,762 110,809

50% of the PSP options granted in 2017 will vest conditional on Group TSR relative to the TSR of a comparator group of companies, with
the remaining 50% vesting conditional upon the internal balanced corporate scorecard. The share price on the grant date for PSP options
awarded in the year was 325 pence and the weighted average fair value of the PSP options granted during the year was 177 pence.

All of the PSP options outstanding at the end of the period had an exercise price of £nil. The weighted average remaining contractual life was
28 months.

The number of options exercisable at the year end was nil.


-----

6.2 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED
Bonus Matching Plan (BMP)
Under the BMP, annual awards of performance and service-related shares were made for no consideration to executive directors and other
senior executives up to a maximum of 150% of their annual bonus up until 2016. The BMP was replaced in 2017 by the PSP. For awards prior
to 2017, a proportion of the shares vesting under the BMP are conditional upon whether the Group’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) matches
or outperforms an index (determined in accordance with the scheme rules) over three years and a proportion of the shares vesting is
conditional upon performance against the internal balanced corporate scorecard. The fair value of the 2017, 2016 and 2015 BMP awards
of £0.6 million, £2.6 million and £3.3 million respectively, are being charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the
corresponding three-year vesting periods.

The fair value of BMP awards is calculated using a Monte-Carlo valuation model, which takes into account the estimated probability of
different levels of vesting. No BMP awards were made in 2017.

Movements in the number of share options outstanding for the BMP awards is as follows:

At 31 December 2,314,155 3,193,932

For the BMP options exercised during the period, the weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 308 pence (2016: 232 pence).

All of the BMP options outstanding at the end of the period had an exercise price of £nil (2016: £nil). The weighted average remaining
contractual life was nine months (2016: 17 months).

The number of options exercisable at the year end was nil (2016: nil).

Savings-Related Share Option Plan (SAYE)
In April 2017, participation in the SAYE plan was offered again to all qualifying employees. Options were granted for employees to acquire
shares at a price of 280 pence (2016: 203 pence), representing a discount of 20% to the prevailing market price determined in accordance
with the scheme rules. The options are exercisable at the end of three or five-year savings contracts. The fair value of the options granted
in connection with the SAYE plan of £0.9 million (2016: £3.9 million) is being charged to the income statement over the term of the relevant
contracts.

**SECTION 6: OUR PEOPLE**

6.2 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED
The fair value of SAYE options granted and the inputs to the option pricing model used in the current and previous year are set out in the
table below:

Grant date 5 April 2017 5 April 2017 5 April 2016 5 April 2016

Share price at grant date (pence) 328 328 286 286

Vesting period 3 years 5 years 3 years 5 years

Exercise price (pence) 280 280 203 203

Dividend yield 1.8% 2.5% 2.9% 5.0%

Annual risk-free interest rate 0.73% 0.90% 0.81% 0.95%

Expected volatility 41.2% 37.3% 40.0% 37.6%

Fair value of options granted (pence) 106 103 101 82

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous three and five years
respectively. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of nontransferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

For the SAYE options exercised during the period, the weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 305 pence (2016: 337 pence).

The weighted average exercise price of SAYE options outstanding at the end of the period was 224 pence (2016: 216 pence). The weighted
average remaining contractual life was 22 months (2016: 31 months).

The number of options exercisable at the year end was nil (2016: nil).

Additional information in relation to the Group’s share-based incentive plans is included in the Remuneration Committee report.

6.3 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS
We operate one defined benefit and four defined contribution pension schemes.

The Drax Power Group (DPG) section of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme (ESPS) is a defined benefit scheme; a pension arrangement
under which participating members receive a pension benefit at retirement determined by the scheme rules. Members are typically entitled
to an annual pension on retirement of 1/80th of final pensionable salary for each year of service plus a tax-free lump sum of three times
pension.

The Drax Group Personal Pension Plan, Haven Power Personal Pension Plan, Opus Energy Group Personal Pension Plan and Drax Biomass
Inc. 401(K) Plan are defined contribution schemes, which provide a retirement benefit that is dependent upon actual contributions made by
the Group and members of the relevant scheme.

Accounting policy
Payments to defined contribution schemes are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered services that entitle them to the
contributions. The income statement charge for the defined contribution scheme represents the contributions due to be paid by the Group
in respect of the current period.

For the defined benefit pension scheme, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial
valuations being carried out at the end of each reporting period. Remeasurement of the obligation, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the
effect of the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on scheme assets (excluding interest), is recognised immediately in the balance sheet
with a charge or credit to the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which it occurs. Defined benefit costs, including current
service costs, past service costs and gains and losses on curtailments and settlements are recognised in the income statement as part of
operating and administrative expenses in the period in which they occur. The net interest expense is recognised in finance costs.

Significant estimation uncertainty
Measurement of the defined benefit obligation using the projected unit credit method involves the use of key assumptions, including
discount rates, inflation rates, salary and pension increases, and mortality rates. These actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually and
modified as appropriate. The Group believes that the assumptions utilised in measuring obligations under the scheme are reasonable based
on prior experience, market conditions and the advice of scheme actuaries. However, actual results may differ from such assumptions.

The assumptions applied in 2017 have been prepared on a consistent basis with those in the previous period and in accordance with
independent actuarial advice received.

Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates four defined contribution schemes, the Drax Group Personal Pension Plan, Haven Power Personal Pension Plan, Opus
Energy Group Personal Pension Plan and Drax Biomass Inc. 401(K) Plan, for all qualifying employees. Pension costs for the defined
contribution schemes are as follows:

Years ended 31 December


2017
£m


2016
£m


Total included in staff costs (note 6.1) 8.1 5.6

As at 31 December 2017, contributions of £nil (2016: £0.5 million) due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the
schemes. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.

Defined benefit scheme
The DPG section of the ESPS was closed to new members as from 1 January 2002 unless they qualify through being existing members of
another part of the ESPS. Members who joined before this date continue to build up pension benefits as part of the scheme.

The DPG ESPS exposes the Group to actuarial and other risks, the most significant of which are considered to be:

Investment risk The scheme liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if assets
underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. The scheme holds a significant proportion of growth assets
(equities, property and direct lending) which, though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term,
create volatility and risk in the short term. The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains
appropriate given the scheme’s long-term objectives.

Discount rate risk A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed upon the scheme’s liabilities, although this will be
partially offset by an increase in the value of the scheme’s bond holdings.

Longevity risk The majority of the scheme’s obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life
expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities of the scheme.

Inflation risk The majority of the scheme’s obligations to pay benefits are linked to inflation, and, as such, higher inflation will lead
to higher liabilities. The majority of the assets held by the scheme are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated
with inflation, such that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit. In most cases, caps on inflationary
increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation.

Other risks include operational risks (such as paying out the wrong benefits), legislative risks (such as the Government increasing the burden
on pension schemes through new legislation) and other demographic risks (such as making a higher proportion of members with dependants
eligible to receive pensions from the Group). The Trustees insure certain benefits payable on death before retirement.

A contingent liability exists in relation to the equalisation of Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP). See note 7.5 for details.

The most recent funding valuation of the DPG ESPS was carried out by Aon Hewitt, a qualified independent actuary, as at 31 March 2016.
The actuarial review at 31 December 2017 is based on the same membership and other data as this funding valuation. The scheme board
accepted the advice of the actuary and approved the use of these assumptions for the purpose of assessing the scheme cost. Future
valuations are required by law at intervals of no more than three years.

The results of the latest funding valuation at 31 March 2016 have been adjusted to the balance sheet date, taking into account experience
over the period since 31 March 2016, changes in market conditions and differences in financial and demographic assumptions. The present
value of the defined benefit obligation, and the related current service costs were measured using the projected unit credit method. The
principal assumptions used, which reflect the nature and term of the scheme liabilities, are as follows:

As at 31 December


2017
% p.a.


2016
% p.a.


Discount rate 2.6 2.8

Inflation (RPI) 3.2 3.2

Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.0 3.1

Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.8 3.8

Mortality assumptions are based on recent actual mortality experience of scheme members and allow for expected future improvements
in mortality rates. The assumptions are that a member aged 60 in 2017 will live, on average, for a further 26 years if they are male
(2016: 27 years) and for a further 29 years if they are female (2016: 29 years). Life expectancy at age 60 for male and female non-pensioners
currently aged 45 is assumed to be 27 and 30 years respectively (2016: 28 and 31 years respectively).

The actuarial gains of £4.8 million (2016: £58.8 million losses) reflect losses of £4.5 million arising from changes in financial assumptions
(2016: losses of £71.4 million), offset by £5.5 million gains arising from changes in demographic assumptions and gains arising from scheme
experience of £3.8 million (2016: gains of £1.9 million and £10.7 million respectively).

The losses due to changes in financial assumptions principally reflect the increase in the present value of the scheme liabilities arising as a
result of the change in discount rate assumption to 2.60% (2016: 2.75%) following reductions in corporate bond yields.

Cash and other assets[(3)] 20.8 19.4

Fair value of total plan assets 305.3 281.3

Notes:
(1) At 31 December 2017 the scheme’s long-term asset strategy was: global equity (20%), direct lending (10%), emerging market equity (5%), fixed interest bonds (15%), corporate bonds (6%), liability driven
investing (29%) and long lease property (15%)
(2) Fixed interest bonds include a mixture of corporate, Government and absolute return bonds. Approximately 10% of the bonds have a sub-investment grade credit rating (i.e. BB+ or lower)
(3) Other assets include £19.0 million of investments in direct lending, a type of private equity vehicle, which is not quoted in an active market (2016: £17.9 million)

The pension plan assets do not include any ordinary shares issued by Drax Group plc or any property occupied by the Group.

The Group employs a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return on pension plan assets. Historical markets are
studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return for each asset class relative to the actual
asset allocation for the scheme.

The assumptions for discount rate, inflation rate, rate of increase in pensions paid and expected return on plan assets all have a potentially
significant effect on the measurement of the scheme deficit. The following table provides an indication of the sensitivity of the pension
deficit at 31 December 2017 to changes in these assumptions:


%


(Decrease)/
increase in
net liability
£m


Discount rate – Increase 0.25 (15.6)

– Decrease 0.25 16.3

Inflation rate[(1)] – Increase 0.25 13.7

– Decrease 0.25 (13.2)

Life expectancy – Increase 1 year 10.9

– Decrease 1 year (10.9)

Note:
(1) The sensitivity of the scheme liabilities to salary and pension increases is closely correlated with inflation

The Group is exposed to investment and other experience risks, as described above, and may need to make additional contributions where it
is estimated that the benefits will not be met from regular contributions and expected investment income.

The defined benefit obligation includes benefits for current employees of the Group (60%), former employees of the Group who are yet to
retire (5%) and retired pensioners (35%). The weighted-average period over which benefit payments are expected to be made, or the duration
of the scheme liabilities, was assessed at the 31 March 2016 funding valuation to be 21 years.

Future contributions
The Group expects to make regular contributions, in respect of service costs, of £10.8 million to the defined benefit pension plan during the
12 months ended 31 December 2018.

In addition to regular contributions, deficit contributions have been agreed with the Trustees based upon the Technical Provisions as at the
31 March 2016 valuation. The Technical Provisions indicate a deficit of £64 million including an estimate of the impact of future service costs,
which do not meet the definition of a liability at 31 December 2017 for inclusion in the financial statements. This valuation has not changed
materially between the 31 March 2016 valuation date and 31 December 2017.

The Group has agreed to make additional contributions over the period to 31 December 2025 to eliminate the deficit. At this point the
scheme is expected to be self-sufficient, unless material adverse changes in economic conditions arise compared to those assumed in the
valuation. The Group is confident that the additional contributions are manageable within the Group's business plan. The terms of the Trust
Deed allow the Group to recover any surplus once the liabilities of the scheme have been settled, accordingly the deficit contributions will
not give rise to an unrecognised surplus.

SECTION 7
### Risk management

This section provides disclosures around financial risk management, including the financial instruments we use to mitigate such risks.

7.1 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, liquidity
risk, counterparty risk and credit risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of commodity and
financial markets and seeks to manage potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance.

The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. Risk management is carried out by the risk management
committees as explained in principal risks and uncertainties (page 51) which identify, evaluate and hedge financial risks in close coordination
with the Group’s trading function under policies approved by the Board of directors.

Commodity price risk
The Group is exposed to the effect of fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly the price of electricity, the price of coal, sustainable
wood fibre and pellets and other fuels, and the price of CO2 emissions allowances. Price variations and market cycles have historically
influenced the financial results of the Group and are expected to continue to do so.

The Group has a policy of securing forward power sales, purchases of fuel and CO2 emissions allowances when profitable to do so. All
commitments to sell power under fixed price contracts are designated as cash flow hedges as they reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure
resulting from fluctuations in the price of electricity.

The Group purchases coal, sustainable biomass and other fuels under either fixed or variable priced contracts with different maturities from
a variety of domestic and international sources. All international physical coal purchase contracts transacted at a fixed price, and financial
coal contracts exchanging floating price coal for fixed price amounts, are designated as cash flow hedges as they reduce the Group’s cash
flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of coal.

The Group purchases CO2 emissions allowances under fixed price contracts with different maturity dates from a range of domestic and
international sources. All commitments to purchase CO2 emissions allowances under fixed price contracts are designated as cash flow
hedges as they reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of CO2 emissions allowances.

Commodity price sensitivity
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to commodity prices for outstanding monetary items at the
balance sheet date. The analysis is based on the Group’s commodity financial instruments held at each balance sheet date.

If commodity prices had been 5% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s:

– loss after tax for the year ended 31 December 2017 would decrease/increase by £1.5 million (2016: profit after tax would increase/decrease
by £3.4 million). This is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure to oil derivatives; and
– the hedge reserve would increase/decrease by £5.6 million (2016: increase/decrease by £36.3 million) mainly as a result of the changes in
the fair value of financial coal and power derivatives.

Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk, principally in relation to its net debt to the extent arising from floating rate debt instruments.
Historically, the Group has sought to mitigate this risk with interest rate hedges on a proportion of its debt facilities. The Group has no
interest rate swaps outstanding at the balance sheet date; however, this risk management tool remains available to the Group. Information
about the Group’s instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk and their repayment schedules is provided below.

Interest rate sensitivity
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for non-derivative instruments at the balance
sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liability outstanding at the balance sheet date
was outstanding for the whole year.

If interest rates had been 1% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s loss after tax and net assets for the year
ended 31 December 2017 would decrease/increase by £2.2 million (2016: profit after tax would decrease/increase by £1.8 million) as a result
of the changes in interest payable during the period.

Foreign currency risk
Forward foreign currency exchange contracts are entered into principally in order to hedge purchases of fuel for use in the Power
Generation business. These purchases are typically denominated in US Dollars, Canadian Dollars or Euros.

Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising a variety of foreign currency exchange contracts. The
Group enters into both forward currency purchase and currency option contracts to manage its anticipated foreign currency requirements
over a rolling five-year period for both contracted and forecast transactions.


-----

**SECTION 7: RISK MANAGEMENT**

7.1 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
Foreign currency sensitivity
If Sterling exchange rates had been 5% stronger/weaker against other currencies and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s:

– loss after tax for the year ended 31 December 2017 would increase/decrease by £351.1 million/£285.5 million (2016: profit after tax would
decrease/increase by £252.6 million/£277.7 million). This is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure to foreign currency exchange
contracts entered in relation to fuel purchase contracts; and
– other equity reserves would decrease/increase by £111.1 million/£122.8 million (2016: decrease/increase by £78.7 million/£87 million) as a
result of the changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts.

Liquidity risk
The treasury function is responsible for liquidity, funding and settlement management under policies approved by the Board of directors.
Liquidity needs are monitored using regular forecasting of operational cash flows and financing commitments. The Group maintains a
mixture of cash and cash equivalents, and committed facilities in order to ensure sufficient funding for business requirements.

The following tables set out details of the expected contractual maturity of non-derivative financial liabilities. The tables include both
interest and principal cash flows. To the extent that interest flows are floating rate, the undiscounted amount is derived from interest rate
curves at the balance sheet date.

7.1 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
In managing liquidity risk, the Group has access to facilities that enable it to accelerate the cash flows associated with certain of its
receivables (principally those related to ROC sales and retail power sales). Each of these facilities is provided on a non-recourse basis and
accordingly receivables sold under each facility are derecognised from the balance sheet at the point of sale. The impact on the Group’s cash
flows is detailed in note 4.4.

Counterparty risk
As the Group relies on third party suppliers for the delivery of currency, coal, sustainable compressed wood pellets and other goods and
services, it is exposed to the risk of non-performance by these third party suppliers. If a large supplier were to fall into financial difficulty and/
or fail to deliver against its contract with the Group, there would be additional costs associated with securing the lost goods or services from
other suppliers.

The Group enters into contracts for the sale of electricity to a number of counterparties. The failure of one or more of these counterparties
to perform their contractual obligations may cause the Group financial distress or increase the risk profile of the Group.

Credit risk
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the balance sheet date, as summarised
below:

As at 31 December


2017
£m


2016
£m


Financial assets:

Cash and cash equivalents 222.3 228.4

Trade and other receivables 409.2 296.9

Other fixed asset investments 1.3 –

Derivative financial instruments 366.2 891.3

999.0 1,416.6

Trade and other receivables are stated gross of the provision for doubtful debts of £28.2 million (2016: £4.0 million).

Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by risk management committees. Where considered
appropriate, counterparties are required to provide credit support in the form of a parent company guarantee, letter of credit, deed of charge,
or cash collateral. In addition, where deemed appropriate, the Group has historically purchased credit default swaps.

The investment of surplus cash is undertaken to maximise the return within Board-approved policies. These policies manage credit risk
exposure by setting out minimum rating requirements, maximum investment with any one counterparty and the maturity profile.

Capital management
The Group manages its capital to ensure it is able to continue as a going concern, and maintain its credit rating while maximising the return
to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders’ equity
(excluding the hedge reserve), plus net debt. Net debt is comprised of borrowings disclosed in note 4.3 and cash and cash equivalents in
note 4.2.

**SECTION 7: RISK MANAGEMENT**

7.2 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
We enter into forward contracts for the purchase and sale of physical commodities (principally power, gas, coal, sustainable biomass and CO2
emissions allowances) to secure market level bark and dark green spreads on future electricity sales, and also financial forward and option
contracts (principally currency exchange contracts and financial coal and oil derivatives) to fix Sterling cash flows.

We hold these contracts for risk management purposes, to manage key risks facing the business, including commodity price risk and foreign
currency risk (see note 7.1).

A successful commercial hedging strategy is critical to our business model. Our policy is to fix exposures to commodity price movements
and changes in foreign exchange rates using derivative contracts such as those described above. This strategy aims to de-risk the business,
providing security and certainty over cash flows into the future. As at 31 December 2017, due to the strengthening of Sterling against the
US Dollar, the fair value of our forward derivative contracts, consisting largely of forward contracts for the purchase of foreign currencies
(principally for the purpose of fixing the Sterling cost of sustainable compressed wood pellet purchases), decreased to £160.0 million
(2016: £527.8 million). The strengthening in Sterling during 2017 partially reversed the significant mark to market gains posted during 2016
as its value fell following the Brexit vote.

Accounting policy
At the balance sheet date all contracts (subject to certain exemptions described below) must be measured at fair value, which is in essence
the difference between the price we have secured in the contract, and the price we could achieve in the market at that point in time.

Changes in fair value are recognised either within the income statement or the hedge reserve, dependent upon whether the contract in
question qualifies as an effective hedge under IFRS (see note 7.4).

Where possible, the Group has taken advantage of the own-use exemption which allows qualifying contracts to be excluded from fair value
mark-to-market accounting. This applies to certain contracts for physical commodities entered into and held for our own purchase, sale or
usage requirements, including forward contracts for the purchase of biomass, and coal from domestic sources.

Contracts which do not qualify for the own-use exemption – principally power, gas, financial oil, financial coal, CO2 emissions allowances and
forward foreign currency exchange contracts – are accounted for as derivatives in accordance with IAS 39 and are recorded in the balance
sheet at fair value, with changes in fair value reflected through the hedge reserve (note 7.4) to the extent that the contracts are designated
as effective hedges in accordance with IAS 39, or the income statement where the hedge accounting requirements are not met. The Group
enters into forward contracts solely for the purpose of financial risk management and considers all of its contracts to be economic hedges,
regardless of whether the specific criteria for hedge accounting are met.

Derivative financial instruments with a maturity date within 12 months from the balance sheet date are classified as current assets or
liabilities. Instruments with a maturity date beyond 12 months are classified as non-current assets or liabilities.

The location in the consolidated financial statements of the changes in fair value of derivative contracts in 2017 is summarised in the table

7.2 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED
Significant estimation uncertainty
The fair values of derivative instruments for commodities and foreign currency exchange contracts are determined using forward price
curves. Forward price curves represent the Group’s estimates of the prices at which a buyer or seller could contract today for delivery or
settlement of a commodity or foreign exchange payment or receipt, at future dates. The Group generally bases forward price curves upon
readily obtainable market price quotations, as the Group’s commodity and forward foreign exchange contracts do not generally extend
beyond the actively traded portion of these curves. However, the forward price curves used are only an estimate of how future prices will
move and are, therefore, subjective. Where derivative financial instruments include options these are valued using an option pricing model.
Inputs to the model include market commodity prices, forward price curves, the term of the option, discount rate and assumptions around
volatility based on historical movements. The inputs include assumptions around future transactions and market movements, as well as
credit risk and are, therefore, subjective.

Fair value accounting
Forward contracts for the sale of power, purchase of coal from international sources, purchase of CO2 emissions allowances, financial coal,
financial oil, gas (collectively “Commodity contracts”) and foreign currency exchange contracts are recorded in the balance sheet at fair
value as follows:

The total reduction in the fair value of these contracts of £365.4 million (2016: £506.9 million gain) is recognised in the income statement or
the hedge reserve, dependent upon whether the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 are met, as follows:

We maintain a substantial foreign currency hedging programme to secure the Sterling cost of future purchases of fuel in foreign currencies.
The vast majority of our fuel purchases, and therefore our currency exchange contracts, are denominated in US Dollars. As noted on
page 164, the unrealised losses reflect the strengthening of Sterling against the US Dollar in the year.

**SECTION 7: RISK MANAGEMENT**

7.2 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED
A material proportion of these contracts are not designated in hedge accounting relationships under IAS 39 and thus the gains on these
contracts were recognised in the income statement.

Unrealised losses recognised in the hedge reserve principally reflect losses on the portion of our forward currency exchange contracts that
are designated in effective hedge relationships in accordance with IAS 39.

Fair value measurement

– Commodity contracts fair value – The fair value of open commodity contracts that do not qualify for the own-use exemption is calculated
by reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date. As contracts are generally short-term, forward market price curves are
available for the duration of the contracts. The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price; the
quoted price for financial liabilities is the current ask price.
– Forward foreign currency exchange contracts fair value – The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts is determined
using forward currency exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
– Other financial contracts fair value – The fair value of other financial contracts that do not qualify for the own-use exemption, is
calculated by reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date. As contracts are generally short-term, forward market price
curves are available for the duration of the contracts.

The fair values of all derivative financial instruments are discounted to reflect the credit risk inherent within the instrument.

The Group has reviewed all significant contracts for the presence of embedded derivatives. Where contracts were found to contain
embedded derivatives, they were considered to be closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, and
therefore do not require separate valuation from their host contracts.

We are required by IFRS to categorise our financial instruments in accordance with the following hierarchy in order to explain the basis on
which their fair values have been determined:

– Level 1 – fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
– Level 2 – fair value measurements are those derived from inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for
the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
– Level 3 – fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not
based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

Categorisation within this fair value measurement hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to
the fair value measurement of the relevant asset or liability.

The fair value of commodity contracts, forward foreign currency exchange contracts and the contingent consideration in the Open Cycle
Gas Turbine sites acquisition (see note 3.6) are largely determined by comparison between forward market prices and the contract price;
therefore these contracts are categorised as Level 2.

There have been no transfers during the year between Level 1, 2 or 3 category inputs.

7.3 OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
We hold a variety of other non-derivative financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, payables and receivables
arising from our operations.

Accounting policy
Cash and cash equivalents (note 4.2), trade and other receivables (note 3.5), and trade and other payables (note 3.6) generally have a short
time in which to mature. For this reason their carrying values, on the historical cost basis, approximate to their fair value. The Group’s
borrowings are set out in detail in note 4.3.


-----

7.4 HEDGE RESERVE
Changes in the fair value of our derivative commodity, financial and currency contracts are recognised in the hedge reserve, to the extent
that they qualify as effective hedges under accounting rules. The cumulative gains and losses unwind and are released as the related
contracts mature and we take delivery of the associated commodity or currency.

As described in note 7.2, all of our derivative contracts are entered into for the purpose of commercial hedging; however, not all of these
contracts qualify as effective hedges under IAS 39. The changes in fair value of contracts that do not meet the definition of an IFRS effective
hedge are recognised in the income statement. Managing our principal risks and uncertainties is about locking down exposures to moving
prices and securing market level dark green and bark spreads for the future.

The Group designates certain hedging instruments used to address commodity price risk and foreign exchange risk as cash flow hedges.
At the inception of the hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item is documented, along with its risk
management objectives. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging
instruments used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items. Changes in fair value of
contracts designated into such hedging relationships are recognised within the hedge reserve to the extent they are effective.

The Group’s cash flow hedges relate to commodity contracts (principally commitments to sell power) and forward foreign currency
exchange contracts. Amounts are recognised in the hedge reserve as the designated contracts are marked to market at each period end
for the effective portion of the hedge, which is generally 100% of the relevant contract. Amounts held within the hedge reserve are then
released as the related contract matures and the hedged transaction impacts profit or loss. For power sales contracts, this is when the
underlying power is delivered. For currency contracts, this is when the associated foreign currency transaction is recognised. Further
information about the Group’s accounting for financial instruments is included in note 7.2.

No ineffectiveness was recognised in the income statement in the year (2016: £6.4 million).

**SECTION 7: RISK MANAGEMENT**

7.5 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Contingent liabilities are potential future outflows of cash that are dependent on a future event that is outside of our control. The amount
and timing of any payment is uncertain and cannot be measured reliably.

Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP)
The UK Government intends to implement legislation to equalise the GMP, resulting in an increase in the value of GMP for males. This would
correspondingly increase the defined benefit pension obligation of the Group (note 6.3). At present, the methodology for implementing the
equalisation is uncertain and thus the impact cannot be reliably measured. As a result, no allowance has been made for GMP equalisation in
the calculation of the defined benefit obligation within these consolidated financial statements.

Guarantees
In addition to the amount drawn down against the bank loans, certain members of the Group guarantee the obligations of a number of banks
in respect of letters of credit issued by those banks to counterparties of the Group. As at 31 December 2017, the Group’s contingent liability in
respect of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility amounted to £35.7 million (2016: £57.9 million).

The Group also guarantees obligations in the form of surety bonds with a number of insurers amounting to £41.3 million (2016: £nil).

7.6 COMMITMENTS
We have a number of financial commitments (i.e. a contractual requirement to make a cash payment in the future) that are not recorded in
our balance sheet as the contract is not yet due for delivery. Such commitments include contracts for the future purchase of coal and
biomass, operating leases for land and buildings, contracts for the construction of assets and contracts for the provision of services.

these contracts relate to the purchase of wood pellets, they are not reflected elsewhere in our financial statements owing to application of
the “own-use” exemption from fair value accounting to such contracts (see note 7.2).

SECTION 8
### Reference information

This section details reference information relevant to the accounts. Here we describe the general information about the Group
(e.g. operations and registered office). We also set out the basis of preparation of the accounts and general accounting policies that are not
specific to any one note.

8.1 GENERAL INFORMATION
Drax Group plc (the Company) is incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act. The Company and its subsidiaries (together,
the Group) have three principal activities:

– electricity generation;
– electricity supply to business customers; and
– manufacturing of sustainable compressed wood pellets for use in electricity production.

The Group’s activities are principally based within the UK, with the wood pellet manufacturing activities situated in the US.

The address of the Company’s registered office and principal establishment is Drax Power Station, Selby, North Yorkshire, YO8 8PH, United
Kingdom. A full list of operating companies of the Group is disclosed in note 5 to the Company’s separate financial statements, which follow
these consolidated financial statements.

8.2 BASIS OF PREPARATION
Adoption of new and revised accounting standards
A number of new and amended standards became effective for the first time in 2017. The Group adopted the following from 1 January 2017:

IAS 12 (amended) – Income Taxes – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017.

IAS 7 (amended) – Statement of Cash Flows – effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017.

The adoption of these updates and amendments has not had a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.

At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following new or amended standards and relevant interpretations, which have
not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective (and some of which were pending endorsement by the EU
– marked by *):

IFRS 2 – Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions – effective for annual periods beginning on or after
1 January 2018.

IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.

IFRS 15 (including clarifications issued on 12 April 2016) – Revenue from Contracts with Customers – effective for annual reporting periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2018.

IAS 40 (amended) – Investment Property – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.*

IFRIC 22 – Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after
1 January 2018.*

IFRIC 23 – Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments – effective for annual reports beginning on or after 1 January 2019.*

IFRS 16 (amended) – Leases – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.

IFRS 10 (amended) – Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 (amended) – Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (2011) –
effective date deferred indefinitely.*

Adoption of the other standards in future periods is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group, other
than the three standards noted below.

IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments
The Group adopted IFRS 9 with effect from 1 January 2018. IFRS 9 addresses the classification, measurement and derecognition of financial
assets and financial liabilities, introduces new rules for hedge accounting and a new impairment model for financial assets, replacing the
previous requirements of IAS 39.

The Group's current accounting for financial instruments is set out in further detail in note 7.2.


-----

**SECTION 8: REFERENCE INFORMATION**

8.2 BASIS OF PREPARATION CONTINUED
The Group does not expect the new requirements to have a significant impact on the classification and measurement of its financial assets
or financial liabilities.

The new hedge accounting rules will align the accounting for hedging instruments more closely with the Group's risk management
practices. The Group's existing hedge relationships will continue to qualify as hedges. No new hedge relationships have been designated as
at 1 January 2018; however, we anticipate opportunities to designate additional contracts into hedge relationships in future, potentially
reducing income statement volatility from fair value movements on such contracts.

IFRS 9 allows a policy choice to designate the fair value movements relating to forward basis points and the time value of money of options
as a "cost of hedging" and recognise these movements as a component of other comprehensive income (OCI). The Group intends to adopt
this policy. Currently these values are recognised in the unrealised gains/losses on derivative contracts line in the income statement. Had
this policy been in place during the year ended 31 December 2017, the impact would have been to reduce the loss before tax by approximately
£32 million and the loss after tax by approximately £26 million, with an identical post-tax expense recognised in other comprehensive
income. There is no impact on the balance sheet valuation of derivative contracts.

As unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts are currently recognised in the income statement below EBITDA and are excluded
from underlying earnings (see note 2.7), the changes described above will have no impact on EBITDA or underlying earnings.

The new impairment model requires the measurement of impairment provisions to be based on expected credit losses, rather than incurred
credit losses as is the case under IAS 39. We expect this to impact the Group's calculation of impairment provisions in respect of trade
receivable balances. We estimate that such impairment provisions will increase modestly as a result (less than £1 million) with a one-off
corresponding reduction in EBITDA and underlying earnings in 2018.

The new standard also introduces additional disclosure requirements in respect of financial instruments. We anticipate an increase in the
level of financial instrument disclosure, particularly in the year ended 31 December 2018 following the adoption of the new standard.

IFRS 15 – Revenue from Customer Contracts
The Group has completed an impact assessment for the adoption of IFRS 15. The standard has been adopted from 1 January 2018.

IFRS 15 introduces a five-step model for determining the recognition and measurement of revenue, which is more in-depth and provides
additional guidance compared to the previous revenue standard. The Group's main sources of revenue and existing revenue recognition
policies are described in more detail in note 2.2.

Having assessed the Group's material contracts against the new model, a significant change to the quantum and timing of the recognition of
revenue and profits is considered unlikely. The review has included the sources of revenue referred to in note 2.2.

IFRS 15 introduces a number of areas of judgement into the revenue recognition process. In determining that no significant change is
anticipated, the most critical areas of judgement relate to the B2B Energy Supply businesses. Our assessment has considered the
identification of performance obligations within the customer contracts, the assessment of when each performance obligation is satisfied
and the treatment of variable consideration. In all three of these areas, the current policies have been assessed and we have concluded that
they are in line with the new requirements.

In the Group's other businesses, the significant contracts are not complex, being characterised by a single performance obligation that is
satisfied at a point in time with a fixed consideration. Therefore, we have concluded that there will be no impact on transition to IFRS 15.

IFRS 16 – Leases
IFRS 16 introduces a new model for accounting for leases. The principal change compared to the current standard is to bring leases
previously classified as operating leases onto the balance sheet, subject to exemptions and exceptions for short-term and low-value leases.

This will result in an increase in assets, lease liabilities, depreciation and finance charges, and a reduction in operating expenditure, when
compared to previous periods.

At 31 December 2017, the Group has non-cancellable operating lease commitments of £43.5 million (see note 7.6).

The Group intends to undertake a comprehensive review, prior to the effective date, to quantify the above effects. This review will also
consider whether certain contracts currently not classified as leases meet the definition of a lease under IFRS 16.

The Group intends to adopt IFRS 16 in the first period it becomes mandatory, which commences on 1 January 2019.

**Summary of our audit approach**

Key risks The key risks that we identified in the current year were:

– Asset impairment–

– Useful economic life assumptions–

– Valuation of commodity and foreign exchange contracts–

– Existence and valuation of biomass stocks–

– Valuation and recoverability of ROCs–

Materiality The materiality that we used in the current year was £4.2 million which was determined based on a blended basis taking into
consideration a number of available metrics.

Scoping We focused our group audit scope primarily on the audit work at three locations, being Drax Power, Haven Power and Drax Biomass.
All of these were subject to a full scope audit. These three locations represent the principal business units and account for all of the
group’s net assets, revenue and profit before tax.

Significant changes in our approach Our audit approach remains consistent to the prior year. We have refined our key risk in relation to stocks and have focused specifically
on biomass existence and valuation and identified a new risk in relation to the useful economic life assumptions adopted.

**Going concern and the directors’ assessment of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the group**


We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to:

– the directors’ confirmation on page 61 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the group, –
including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
– the disclosures on pages 55 to 61 that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated;–

– the directors’ statement on page 111 about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of –
accounting in preparing them and their identification of any material uncertainties to the group’s ability to continue to do so over
a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements; and
– the directors’ explanation on page 54 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the group, over what period they have done –
so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation
that the group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment,
including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.

**112**


We confirm that we have nothing
material to add or draw attention to
in respect of these matters.

We agreed with the directors’ adoption
of the going concern basis of accounting
and we did not identify any such material
uncertainties. However, because not
all future events or conditions can
be predicted, this statement is not a
guarantee as to the group’s ability
to continue as a going concern.


-----

**Independence**

We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s Ethical Standards for Auditors and confirm that we are
independent of the group and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.


We confirm that we are independent of
the group and we have fulfilled our other
ethical responsibilities in accordance
with those standards. We also confirm
we have not provided any of the
prohibited non-audit services referred
to in those standards.


**Our assessment of risks of material misstatement**
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the allocation of
resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.

This year we have refined the risk relating to stocks to focus on the existence and valuation of biomass stocks, as opposed to coal and biomass
stocks in the prior year as this is where we consider the most judgement to exist. As per note 3.3, biomass stocks have increased from £119 million
at 31 December 2015 to £198 million at 31 December 2016. Coal stocks have reduced from £89 million at 31 December 2015 to £66 million at
31 December 2016. This reflects the development of the plant.

Useful economic life assumptions has been identified as a new risk in the year. As part of the most recent annual review of asset lives, the estimated
useful life of coal-specific assets at Drax Power Station will be revised with effect from 1 January 2017 and this is considered to be a key judgement.

Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk


Asset Impairment
The Group’s market capitalisation continues to be below its asset value. Additional
contributing factors in the current year which increase the risk of impairment includes
the depreciation of sterling following the Brexit vote, delays in the approval of the CfD,
the UK Government consultation on the future of coal generating assets within the UK
power industry and continued softness in commodity markets. Management has
therefore performed an impairment review in the current year.

As noted in the Group’s critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions in
note 2.4 and the Audit Committee report on page 77, asset impairment has been
considered a key risk by the Audit Committee.

The impairment testing is subject to the application of management judgement in
identifying cash-generating units (CGUs) and various assumptions underlying the
calculation of the value in use for each CGU identified. This assessment also considers
changes in the business which may give rise to additional CGUs, for example the
approval of the CfD on Unit 1 in the current year.

Additionally, these assumptions include the achievability of the long-term business
plan and related modelling assumptions underlying the valuation process.

The significant judgements have been disclosed by management in note 2.4 and include:

– The expected operating lives of the six generating units–

– Future commodity prices beyond the horizon of existing contracted purchases, –
particularly long-term power prices at both baseload and peak times, and biomass
prices in the long term given that biomass is not a standardised commodity traded
openly on exchanges;
– Future foreign exchange rates beyond the horizon of existing contracted purchase –
commitments;
– the continuance of existing biomass support regimes until 2027 and the existence –
of a favourable economic environment for biomass generation thereafter; and
– The discount rate applied to forecast future cash flows.–

Useful economic life assumptions
Previously, the useful economic life of the power station was assumed to end in 2039.
Estimated useful lives are based on past experience, future replacement cycles and
other available evidence; however an inherent degree of judgement remains.

As per note 3.1, as part of the most recent annual review of asset lives, the estimated
useful life of coal-specific assets at Drax Power Station will be revised with effect from
1 January 2017. On 9 November 2016 the Government announced a consultation on
the future closure of unabated coal-fired generation. Following this, management
concluded that coal generation will most likely cease during 2025, shortening the
useful lives of the coal-specific assets which will not be required to support generation
after this date.

Management believe this change will result in an increase of approximately £27 million
per annum in depreciation charges from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2025.


We carried out testing of the design and implementation of key controls related to
asset impairment.

We have challenged management’s identification of CGUs, taking into consideration
the independence of cash flows across key components of the business and
generating units.

We utilised our valuation specialists to benchmark key market related assumptions
including commodity prices, current and future capacity and other support
mechanisms and discount rates against external data where available. For example, we
have compared the commodity price assumptions to the latest available Department
for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (DBEIS), Department of Energy and
Climate Change (DECC) and National Grid forecasts.

We have considered the liquidity of the biomass market and the impact that Drax could
have on that market relating to the volumes of biomass required in the future.

We have also challenged the underlying assumptions and significant judgements used
in management’s impairment model by:

– Running a range of sensitivities to assess whether an impairment would be required –
if a range of more conservative assumptions were adopted;
– Assessing the historical accuracy of management’s budgets and forecasts by –
comparing them to actual performance and verifying the mathematical accuracy of
the cash flow models; and
– Assessing whether the disclosures in note 2.4 of the financial statements –
appropriately disclose the key judgements taken so that the reader of the accounts
is aware of the impact of the financial statement of changes to key assumptions
that may lead to impairment.

We have considered a number of factors as part of our audit including challenging the
reasonableness of key assumptions such as:

– the adequacy of the current and proposed depreciation assumptions across the –
generation asset base;
– consideration of the future ability to generate economic value;–

– factors affecting primary income streams including forecast spreads and external –
factors including political and regulatory requirements; and
– Consistency of the UEL assessment with the impairment analysis above.–

We have also assessed whether 1 January 2017 is an appropriate date from which to
amend the useful economic life.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF DRAX GROUP PLC CONTINUED

Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk


Valuation of commodity and foreign exchange contracts
Unrealised gains on derivative contracts recognised in the income statement are
£177m (2015: £124m), with total assets of £891m and liabilities of £364m recognised on
the balance sheet as at the year end. We note that £666m of assets relate to foreign
currency derivatives at the current year end (2015: £36m).

The valuation of derivative contracts is complex and requires judgement in areas
including the selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and assumptions in
respect of future market prices and credit risk factors.

Further detail of the key judgements are disclosure in the Group’s critical accounting
judgements, estimates and assumptions set out on pages 117 and 118 and the Audit
Committee report on page 77.

Biomass stocks of £198 million (2015: £119 million) are held on the balance sheet at year
end. The most significant judgement relating to stock is considered to be the existence
and valuation of biomass stocks held on-site £21 million.

Given the storage and handling characteristics of the on-site biomass stocks, judgement
is inherent in calculating the volume of biomass stocks owned by the Group because it
is not practical to physically count the stocks at year end. Further details of the key
accounting policy judgements are included in note 3.3, and as noted, the calibrated
weighers and efficiency calculations are subject to a range of tolerable errors.

The valuation of biomass is dependent upon the estimation or measurement of the
tonnage held, the calorific value, its purchase price and its net realisable value.

The weighted average cost calculation is complex and dependant on the tonnage held.
This results in an increasing risk of management error or bias and therefore increased
risk of misstatement.

Valuation and recoverability of ROCs
ROCs with a value of £258 million are held on the balance sheet at the year end (2015:
£266 million). ROCs are recognised as they are earned through generating electricity
from burning biomass. They are initially recognised at fair value (reducing the cost of
biomass consumed in the income statement) and subsequently written down to net
realisable values as appropriate.

Judgement is required by management in estimating both the initial fair value and
estimating net realisable value, including value recovered through the recycling fund.

Further detail is explained in the Group’s critical accounting judgements, estimates and
assumptions set out on pages 117 and 118 and in the Audit Committee report on page 77.


We carried out testing of the design and implementation of key controls related to the
valuation of commodity and foreign exchange contracts.

We used our financial instrument specialists to test management’s key judgements
and calculations, including testing a sample of trades undertaken to trade tickets
confirming key information such as volumes and contracted prices.

We have assessed the valuation models used by management to determine the fair
value of the derivative instruments and performed independent valuations across a
sample of both commodity and foreign exchange contracts.

We have analysed the appropriateness of management’s forward price curve
assumptions by benchmarking these to third party sources and reviewed the
consistency of the assumptions used across other areas of the financial statements
such as asset impairment.

We have challenged management’s approach and assumptions involved in assessing
fair value adjustment such as credit risk, time value of money and spread adjustments.

We carried out testing of the design and implementation of key controls related to the
existence and valuation of on-site biomass stocks.

Our audit procedures include testing the underlying weighted average cost calculation
by agreeing key inputs such as price and volumes to source data including purchase
invoices for amounts delivered in the year. We also sample testing the calorific value of
biomass to third party laboratory reports or purchase invoice as appropriate.

We gained assurance of stock volumes on site during the year through management’s
dome emptying programme. We also sample tested metering data subsequent to the
dome emptying by agreeing to third party sources and internal operational data. We
assessed the tolerable errors in the weighing equipment through agreement to a
sample of third party calibration certificates.

We carried out testing of the design and implementation of key controls related to the
valuation of ROCs.

We gained assurance over the ROCs generated in the year by agreement to Ofgem
confirmation certificates and operational data confirming the level of generation
eligible for ROCs.

We have assessed the initial fair value of ROCs by agreement of the buy-out price to
available third party supporting information and external sales agreements.

We have also challenged the estimates made by management of the recoveries
through the recycling fund, the level of which impacts the estimated net realisable
value of the ROCs held in the balance sheet at year end. This included comparison to
other available third party estimates.


These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do
not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

**Our application of materiality**
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of
a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and
in evaluating the results of our work.

When determining materiality, we considered the decline in earnings this year and at present do not consider that this decline is likely to reflect
a long-term reduction in the size and scale of the business.

We have determined materiality by considering a range of possible benchmarks and the figures derived from those, with a particular focus on
selecting a materiality within the range that we considered appropriate. This included underlying EBITDA (excluding unrealised gains or losses on
derivative contracts, one-off asset obsolescence charges and losses on disposal of assets), profit before and after interest and tax as well as the
scale of the balance sheet and the overall size of the business. We determined materiality for the Group on a blended basis to be £4.2 million
(2015: £6.1 million).

This materiality equates to 0.2% of net assets and 17% of underlying profit before tax (excluding unrealised gains or losses on derivative contracts,
one-off asset obsolesce charges and losses on disposal of assets). Last year materiality was also based on a blended rate.

-----

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £0.2 million (2015: £0.1 million), as
well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. The change in the reporting threshold has
been made following our reassessment of what matters require communicating. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters
that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.

**An overview of the scope of our audit**
Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the group and its environment, including group-wide controls, and assessing the
risks of material misstatement at the group level. Based on that assessment, we focused our group audit scope primarily on the audit work at
three locations (2015: the same three locations), being Drax Power, Haven Power and Drax Biomass. All of these locations were subject to a full
scope audit and they represent the principal business units and account for all of the group’s net assets, revenue and profit before tax, in line with
2015. There were also selected to provide an appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement identified
above. Our audit work at three locations was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity which were lower than group
materiality and ranged from £2.1 million to £3.8 million (2015: £3.0 million to £4.8 million).

At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there
were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject to audit
or audit of specified account balances.

The group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits that has been designed so that the Senior Statutory Auditor visits each
of the locations where the group audit scope was focused at least once every two years and the most significant of them at least once a year.
During 2016 the Senior Statutory Auditor visited two of these locations, and other senior team members visited the third.

**Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006**
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

– the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006;–

– the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is –
consistent with the financial statements; and
– the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.–

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified
any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report.

**Matters on which we are required to report by exception**


Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

– we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or–

– adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been –
received from branches not visited by us; or
– the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.–

Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration have
not been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records
and returns.

Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the company’s
compliance with certain provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code.

Our duty to read other information in the Annual report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the
annual report is:

– materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or–

– apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the group acquired in the course –
of performing our audit; or
– otherwise misleading.–

In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during
the audit and the directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the
annual report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the audit committee which we consider should have
been disclosed.


We have nothing to report in respect of
these matters.

We have nothing to report arising from
these matters.

We have nothing to report arising from
our review.

We confirm that we have not identified
any such inconsistencies or misleading
statements.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF DRAX GROUP PLC CONTINUED

**Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor**
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). We also comply with International Standard on Quality
Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality control procedures are effective, understood and
applied. Our quality controls and systems include our dedicated professional standards review team and independent partner reviews.

This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

**Scope of the audit of the financial statements**
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that
the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial
statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the
audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies
we consider the implications for our report.

# FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**Introduction**
The consolidated financial statements provide detailed information
about the financial performance (Consolidated income statement),
financial position (Consolidated balance sheet), and cash flows
(Consolidated cash flow statement) of Drax Group plc (the Company)
together with all of the entities controlled by the Company (collectively,
the Group).

The notes to the financial statements provide additional information
on the items in the Consolidated income statement, Consolidated
balance sheet and Consolidated cash flow statement. The notes
include explanations of the information presented. In general, the
additional information in the notes to the financial statements is
required by law, International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) or
other regulations to facilitate increased understanding of the primary
statements set out on pages 120 to 124.

**Basis of preparation**
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS
as adopted by the European Union and therefore the consolidated
financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost
basis, except for certain financial assets and liabilities that have been
measured at fair value.

**Going concern**
The Group’s business activities, along with future developments that
may affect its financial performance, position and cash flows, are set
out within the Strategic report on pages 1 to 61 of this document.

In the viability statement on page 54 the directors state that they
have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the next
three years.

Consequently, the directors also have a reasonable expectation
that the Group will continue in existence for the next 12 months and,
therefore, have adopted the going concern basis in preparing these
financial statements.

**Changes in foreign currency exchange rates**
The substantial depreciation of Sterling against the US dollar and
Euro during the second half of 2016 has had a material impact on our
financial statements, resulting in a significant increase in the fair value
of our forward currency purchase contracts in the balance sheet and
income statement volatility due to realised and unrealised currency
exchange gains and losses.

Where the impact is material, we have extended certain disclosures
to highlight the impact of currency exchange gains and losses in
the period. Where relevant, we have re-presented the prior year
comparatives to provide the relevant information to gauge the impact.


**Basis of consolidation**
These consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial
results of the Company and of all entities controlled by the Company,
(its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. The Company
owns 100% of the equity of all subsidiaries.

The impact of all intra-Group transactions are eliminated on
consolidation. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of
during the year are included in the Consolidated income statement
from the date the Company gains control until the date when the
Company ceases to control the subsidiary.

**Accounting policies**
Those accounting policies that are material to our financial statements
are described in note 8.3 to the financial statements or, where specific
to an individual component of the financial statements, in the relevant
note (see contents on page 119).

We have not changed any of our accounting policies in the period;
however we have adopted a material new policy in respect of
accounting for the Contract for Difference (CfD) (see page 118).

A full listing of new standards, interpretations and pronouncements
under IFRS applicable to these financial statements is presented in
note 8.2. The application of these new requirements has not had a
material effect on the financial statements.

**Judgements, estimates and uncertainties**
The preparation of financial statements requires management to
exercise judgement in applying the Group’s accounting policies. It also
requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may
differ from these estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing
basis, with revisions recognised in the period in which the estimates
are revised and in any future periods affected.

The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity are set
out below and in more detail in the related notes.

**Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions**
The judgements that carry the most significant risk of an outcome that
differs from the amount recognised in the financial statements are
as follows:

Property, plant and equipment – property, plant and equipment
is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life.
Estimated useful lives are based on past experience, future
replacement cycles and other available evidence. However, a degree of
judgement is required. Useful economic lives are reviewed annually, we
reduced the useful lives of certain assets in our generation business
from 1 January 2017.

**MORE INFORMATION: note 3.1 on page 137**

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

Impairment – an impairment review is conducted annually for goodwill
and for other assets and cash-generating units where an indicator of
possible impairment exists. The assessment of future cash flows that
underpins such a review is based on management’s best estimate of
future prices, volumes and economic conditions. The calculations are
particularly sensitive to judgement given the long time period covered
by the assessment.

**MORE INFORMATION: note 2.4 on page 130**

Derivatives – derivative financial instruments are recorded in the
Group’s balance sheet at fair value. The assessment of fair value is
derived from assuming a market price for the instrument in question.
The Group bases its assessment of market prices upon forward curves
that are largely derived from readily obtainable quotations and third
party sources. However, any forward curve is based at least in part
upon assumptions about future transactions and market movements.
Where such instruments extend beyond the liquid portion of the
forward curve, the level of judgement increases as the number of
observable transactions decreases.

**MORE INFORMATION: note 7.2 on page 160**

Inventories – fuel inventories are valued at weighted average cost
based on purchase price, or net realisable value where lower. Valuation
is largely based on observable data (such as invoiced costs and
automated weigher readings). However, given the bulk nature of fuels
an element of judgement is required to assess the volume of stock held
at the balance sheet date.

**MORE INFORMATION: note 3.3 on page 140**

Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) – the carrying amount of
ROCs in the Group’s balance sheet is stated at their expected realisable
value. This assessment is based on estimated future sales prices, which
involves judgement.

**MORE INFORMATION: note 3.2 on page 139**

**Other accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions**
Pensions – the Group records a liability in its balance sheet for its
obligation to provide benefits under an approved defined benefit
pension scheme less the fair value of assets held by the pension
scheme. The actuarial valuation of the scheme assets and liabilities is
performed annually and depends on assumptions regarding interest
rates, inflation, future salary and pension increases, mortality and
other factors.

**MORE INFORMATION: note 6.3 on page 152**

Taxation – in accounting for tax liabilities the Group makes
assumptions regarding the likely treatment of items of income
and expenditure for tax purposes. These assumptions are based
on interpretation of relevant legislation and, where required,
consultation with external advisors.

**MORE INFORMATION: note 2.6 on page 132**

**118**


Revenue recognition – the nature of some of the Group’s activities,
particularly within the Retail segment, results in revenue being based
on the estimated volumes of power supplied to customers at an
estimated average price per unit. Assumptions that underpin these
estimates are applied consistently and comparison of past estimates
to final settlements suggests a high degree of accuracy. However,
given the level of judgement involved, actual outcomes may vary
from initial estimates.

**MORE INFORMATION: note 2.2 on page 127**

CfD accounting policy – the CfD is a material new contract for
the Group and the specific accounting treatment is not prescribed
by an existing IFRS. Accordingly, management has had to exercise
judgement in adopting an appropriate policy in accordance with IAS 8.
Management considered the requirements of a number of standards,
including IAS 18 (revenue), IAS 39 (financial instruments), IAS 16
(leases) and IAS 20 (Government Grants) in determining the policy to
be adopted. In particular, management concluded that the contract
did not meet the definition of a derivative financial instrument in IAS 39
on the grounds that cash flows do not become contractually due
until the point of generation and the Group is under no obligation to
generate. Accordingly, amounts due under the CfD are recognised
at the point of generation.

**MORE INFORMATION: note 2.2 on page 127**

**Non-IFRS measures of financial performance**
We present two non-IFRS measures on the face of our income
statement: EBITDA and underlying profit.

EBITDA is the primary measure we use to assess our financial
performance. EBITDA is defined as profit before interest, tax,
depreciation, amortisation and unrealised gains and losses on
derivative contracts.

Underlying measures, including underlying profit before and after
tax and underlying earnings per share (EPS), exclude the impact of
unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts, plus particular
transactions considered to be one-off in nature that do not reflect
the underlying trading and operational performance of the Group.
Underlying profit after tax and EPS exclude the post-tax effect of these
items. In 2015, this excluded an asset obsolescence charge of £109
million. In 2016, this excludes a deferred tax credit of £31 million in
relation to start-up losses in our US business.

A reconciliation of profit for the year attributable to equity holders
(calculated in accordance with IFRS) to underlying profit after tax is
provided in note 2.7.

Under our current distribution policy, dividends are calculated based
upon 50% of underlying profit after tax.

SECTION 2:
# FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

The financial performance section gives further detail on the information in the Consolidated income statement. It includes a summary of
financial performance by business unit (2.1), analysis of certain income statement items (2.2–2.6) and information regarding underlying earnings,
distributable profits and dividends (2.7–2.9). Further commentary regarding our trading and operational performance during the year, which is
predominantly reflected in EBITDA, can be found in the Strategic report on pages 1 to 61, with particular reference to key achievements and
market conditions that have affected our results.

**2.1 Segmental reporting**
The Group is organised into three businesses, with a dedicated management team for each, and a central head office providing certain corporate
functions. Our businesses are:

– Generation: the generation of electricity at Drax Power Station; –

– Biomass Supply: production of sustainable compressed wood pellets at our processing facilities in the US; and –

– Retail: the supply of power to business customers and wood pellets to the domestic heat market. –

Each business is an operating segment for the purpose of segmental reporting. Information reported to the Board for the purposes of assessing
performance and making investment decisions is based on these three operating segments. The measure of profit or loss for each reportable
segment presented to the Board on a regular basis is EBITDA (as defined on page 118).

Operating costs are allocated to segments to the extent they are directly attributable to the activities of that segment. Head office costs are
included within central operating costs.

**Segment revenues and results**

Notes:
(1) Adjustments represent the elimination of intra-group transactions.
(2) £102.6 million of the asset obsolescence charges arose in the Generation segment, with the remaining £6.6 in the Biomass Supply segment.

Assets and working capital are monitored on a consolidated basis, with no separate reporting by segment in the Group’s management
accounts. However, spend on key capital projects is monitored. Total spend on the biomass transformation project during 2016 was £29 million
(2015: £90 million), of which £7 million (2015: £22 million) relates to construction of assets, in the US, within the Biomass Supply segment.

The accounting policies applied for the purpose of measuring the segments’ profits or losses, assets and liabilities are the same as those used in
measuring the corresponding amounts in the Group’s financial statements. The external revenues and results of all of our reporting segments are
subject to seasonality with higher despatch and prices in the winter months, compared to summer months.

**Intra-group trading**
Intra-group transactions are carried out on arm’s-length, commercial terms that where possible equate to market prices at the time of the
transaction. During 2016, the Biomass Supply segment sold wood pellets with a total value of £72.9 million (2015: £28.4 million) to the Generation
segment and the Generation segment sold power, ROCs and LECs with a total value of £868.2 million (2015: £863.2 million) to the Retail segment.

The impact of all intra-group transactions, including any unrealised profit arising (£2.3 million at 31 December 2016), is eliminated on consolidation.

**Major customers**
Total revenue for the year ended 31 December 2016 includes amounts of £541.5 million and £399.3 million (2015: £597.7 million and £468.0 million)
derived from two customers (2015: two customers), each representing 10% or more of the Group’s consolidated revenue for the year. These
revenues arose in the Generation segment.

**126**

**2.2 Revenue**
**Accounting Policy**
Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods or services provided in the normal course of business, net of trade discounts, VAT and other
sales-related taxes and excluding transactions with or between Group companies.

Revenues from the sale of electricity from our generating assets in Drax Power are measured based upon metered output delivered at rates
specified under contract terms or prevailing market rates as applicable.

Two of our biomass-fuelled generating units earn Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) under the UK Government’s Renewables Obligation
(RO) regime. The financial benefit of a ROC is recognised in the income statement at the point the relevant renewable biomass fuel is burnt and
power dispatched as a reduction in the cost of the biomass fuel. A corresponding asset is recognised on the balance sheet (see note 3.2 on
page 139). Revenue from sale of ROCs is recognised when the ROC is transferred to the account of a third party.

Revenue from the sale of electricity directly to business customers through our power retail business, Haven Power, is recognised on the supply
of electricity when a contract exists, supply has taken place, a quantifiable price has been established or can be determined and the receivables
are expected to be recovered at the point of sale. Energy supplied is measured based upon metered consumption and contractual rates; however
where a supply has taken place but is not yet measured or billed, the revenue calculation is estimated based on consumption statistics and selling
price estimates.

Revenues from the sale of wood pellets through our UK domestic pellet retail business, Billington Bioenergy are recognised at the point the
pellets are delivered to the location specified in the contract, which is normally the customer’s premises.

Other revenues derived from the provision of services (for example, the supply of ancillary generation services, such as black start and frequency
response, to National Grid) are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract. Most such contracts are for the delivery of
a service either continually or on an ad-hoc basis over a period of time and thus stage of completion is calculated with reference to the amount
of the contract term that has elapsed. Depending on the contract terms this approach may require judgement in enhancing probable
future outcomes.

Other revenues derived from the sale of goods (for example, by-products from electricity generation such as ash and gypsum) are recognised
at the point the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer, typically at the point of delivery to the customer’s premises.

**CfD payments**
The Group is party to a Contract for Difference (CfD) with The Low Carbon Contracts Company (LCCC), a Government-owned entity responsible
for delivering elements of the Government’s Electricity Market Reform Programme. Under the contract, the Group makes or receives payments in
respect of electricity dispatched from one of its three biomass-fuelled generating units. The payment is calculated with reference to a strike price
of £100 per MWh. The strike price is in 2012 terms and increases each year indexed to UK CPI and system balancing costs. The strike price at
31 December 2016 was £106 per MWh.

Where market prices at the point of generation are above/below the strike price, the Group makes/receives an additional payment to/from
LCCC equivalent to the difference between the market power price at the point of dispatch and the strike price. Such payments are in addition to
amounts received from the sale of the power in the wholesale market and either increase or limit the total income from the power dispatched
from the relevant generating unit to the strike price in the CfD contract.

The Group recognises the income or costs arising from the CfD in the income statement, as a component of revenue, at the point the flow of
economic benefit becomes probable. This is considered to be the point at which the relevant generation is delivered and the payment becomes
contractually due.

The Group began generating under the CfD contract on 21 December 2016 and, in accordance with this policy, accrued £10.3 million of revenue
in respect of amounts due from the LCCC in the period ending 31 December 2016.

**127**

SECTION 2: FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE CONTINUED

**2.2 Revenue continued**
**ROC sales**
The generation and sale of ROCs is a key driver of the Group’s financial performance. The RO scheme started in April 2002 and places an
obligation on electricity suppliers to source an increasing proportion of their electricity from renewable sources. Under the RO, ROCs are
certificates issued to generators of renewable electricity which are then sold to suppliers to demonstrate they have fulfilled their obligations
under the RO. ROCs are managed in compliance periods (CPs), running from April to March annually, CP1 commenced in April 2002.
At 31 December 2016 we are in CP15.

To meet its obligations a supplier can either submit ROCs or pay the “buy-out” price at the end of the CP. The buy-out price was set at £30/ROC in
CP1 and rises with inflation. ROCs are typically procured in arm’s-length transactions with renewable generators at a market price typically slightly
lower than the buy-out price for that CP. At the end of the CP, the amounts collected from suppliers paying the buy-out price form the “recycle
fund”, which is distributed on a pro-rata basis to ROC generators.

The financial benefit of a ROC recognised in the income statement at the point of generation is thus comprised of two parts: the expected value
to be obtained in a sale transaction with a third party supplier and the expected recycle fund benefit to be received at the end of the CP. See note
3.2 on page 139 for further details of ROCs generated and sold by our Generation business and those utilised by our Retail business in the year.

Further analysis of our revenue for the year ending 31 December 2016 is provided in the table below:

The Group’s principal revenues arise from the sale of power, both into the wholesale market via Drax Power, our generation business, and to
Industrial and Commercial and small and medium-sized enterprise business customers via Haven Power, our energy retail business. The Group
also sells wood pellets into the domestic UK heat market via Billington Bioenergy, part of our retail business. Drax Biomass, our US-based wood
pellet manufacturing business, generates all of its revenues intra-group, selling sustainable wood pellets to Drax Power to be used in the
electricity generation process.

ROC sales and CfD income reflect revenues received through Government programmes to support renewable generation. ROC sales reflect
consideration received for sales of ROCs by Drax Power to third parties. CfD income reflects amounts received under the CfD contract awarded
by the UK Government to one of our biomass-fuelled electricity generation units. See CfD payments above for further details.

**2.4 Review of fixed assets for impairment**
**Accounting policy**
The Group reviews its fixed assets (or, where appropriate, groups of assets known as cash-generating units (CGUs)) whenever there is an
indication that an impairment loss may have been suffered. The Group considers the smallest collections of assets that generate independent
cash flows to be its operating entities (Drax Power, Haven Power, Drax Biomass and Billington Bioenergy) and accordingly considers the Group to
be comprised of four CGUs.

If an indication of potential impairment exists, the recoverable amount of the asset or CGU in question is assessed with reference to the present
value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the continuing use of the asset or CGU (value in use) or the expected price that would
be received to sell the asset to another market participant (fair value). The initial assessment of recoverable amount is normally based on value
in use.

Where value in use is calculated, the assessment of future cash flows includes all of the necessary costs expected to be incurred to generate
the cash inflows from the CGU’s assets in their current state and condition, including an allocation of centrally managed costs. Central costs
are only allocated where they are necessary for and directly attributable to the CGU’s activities. Future cash flows include, where relevant,
contracted cash flows arising from our cash flow hedging activities and as a result, the carrying amount of each CGU includes the mark-tomarket value of those cash flow hedges.

The additional value that could be obtained from enhancing or converting the Group’s assets is not reflected, nor the potential benefit of any
future restructuring or reorganisation. In determining value in use, the estimate of future cash flows is discounted to present value using
a pre-tax rate.

If the recoverable amount is less than the current carrying amount in the financial statements, a provision is made to reduce the carrying amount
of the asset or CGU to the estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised immediately in the income statement.

Goodwill balances are assessed for impairment annually (see note 5.2).

**Critical judgement areas**
In 2015, the market capitalisation of the Group fell materially below the carrying value of the Group’s net assets. Whilst the shortfall has reduced
considerably during 2016, this remains the case at the balance sheet date. In addition, commodity markets are weak and the substantial
weakening of Sterling against both the Euro and US dollar in the second half of 2016 indicated a potentially material increase in the long-term
costs of fuel for our generation business, which are predominantly priced in these currencies. Accordingly an impairment review of the Drax
Power CGU was undertaken at the balance sheet date. A review of other CGUs suggested no indicators of impairment.

**130**


-----

**2.4 Review of fixed assets for impairment continued**
The assessment of the present value of future cash flows on which such a review is based is dependent upon a number of assumptions.
In particular, expected future cash flows are based upon management’s estimates of future prices, output, costs and economic support for
renewable energy generation, including access to Capacity Market and Ancillary Services contracts. Where relevant and to the fullest extent
possible, the key assumptions are based on observable market information. However, observable market information is only available for a
limited proportion of the remaining useful lives of the assets under review,

The most critical of these assumptions are discussed below.

**Impairment review**
The carrying amount of the Drax Power CGU at 31 December 2016 was £1,911 million. The value in use of the Drax Power CGU was tested using
the Group’s established planning model.

The analysis assumed that Drax Power’s three biomass-fuelled generating units would continue in operation until the end of their estimated
useful lives, currently considered to be 2039. In line with our assumption that coal-fired generation will cease by 2025, applied in light of the
Government consultation published in November 2016, the three remaining coal-fired units were assumed to cease coal-fired generation by
this date but will then be available for conversion to biomass-fired units. No account has been taken of any cash inflows that could result from
such a conversion (which could take place earlier than 2025) in measuring the value in use of the Drax Power CGU.

The analysis depends on a broad range of assumptions, including the expected life of the six power generating units and the regulatory regime
under which they might operate. The key assumptions (i.e. those most sensitive to a change, possibly resulting in a different outcome for
impairment) are considered to be:

– The expected operating lives of the six generating units, as described above;–

– Future commodity prices beyond the horizon of our existing contracted purchase and sale commitments – notably power prices and –
biomass prices;
– Future foreign exchange rates beyond the horizon of our existing contracted purchase commitments; and–

– The continuance of existing biomass support regimes – CfD and RO – until 2027 and the existence of a favourable economic environment –
for biomass generation thereafter. This includes future Capacity Markets and Ancillary Services revenues.

These assumptions are all dependent on external market movements. The historic volatility in these assumptions is reflected in the financial
performance of the Group but past performance is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future values.

Where available, estimates of future prices are based on signed contracts for purchases and sales with third parties. Transactions beyond
contracted positions are valued using market data and forward price curves, based where possible on data points provided by a reputable third
party source, independent to the Group. In particular, longer-term power prices are based on Department for Business, Energy and Industrial
Strategy and National Grid assumptions. The contracted period for biomass purchases is substantially longer, with the longest-dated contracts
expiring in 2027. Beyond this point, estimated biomass prices are largely based on our internal models and expectations for the biomass market.

Future foreign exchange rates are based on contracted foreign currency purchases to the extent possible. Beyond our contracted position,
exchange rate estimates are based on market forward curves and, beyond this point, Bloomberg data.

Current Government plans for existing renewable support mechanisms, namely the CfD and RO, assume these cease in 2027. The impairment
analysis made no assumptions regarding the direct replacement of these support mechanisms beyond this date. The biomass-fuelled units
that are assumed to continue to generate power do so supported by the prevailing wholesale power price, delivery of ancillary services to the UK
grid and an expectation that capacity market revenues would be available to these units. Our power price forecasts reflect increased volatility
between peak and baseload prices. Assumed revenues from ancillary services and the capacity market are based on projections derived from
current contracts and capacity market outcomes and how we expect the market to evolve. These assumptions reflect our expectation that Drax
will be required to provide generation to support intermittent renewable power and be an essential part of the UK’s energy mix throughout the
life of the units.

The expected future cash flows were discounted using a pre-tax nominal rate of 8.4%. The discount rate is supported by observable market
reports and independent analysis commissioned by, and specific to the circumstances of the Group. This indicated that the recoverable amount
of the Drax Power CGU exceeded its carrying value with headroom of approximately £200 million and therefore that no provisions for impairment
were required.

Sensitivity analysis indicated that, when compared to our base case assumptions, a reduction of approximately 7% in market power prices,
an increase in biomass prices of approximately 11%, or a depreciation of Sterling against the US dollar of some 8% throughout the 23-year term
of the valuation would result in a recoverable amount for the Drax Power CGU that is lower than its carrying amount. This does not consider
the interaction effect of potential changes in several or all of the assumptions simultaneously, and the sensitivities do not take account of any
mitigating actions that could be taken should the changes referred to materialise. In addition, in relation to central costs, no reasonable change
in the method of allocation would result in an impairment charge.

SECTION 2: FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE CONTINUED

**2.5 Net finance costs**
Finance costs reflect expenses incurred in managing our debt structure (such as interest payable on our bank loans) as well as foreign exchange
gains and losses, the unwinding of discounting on provisions for reinstatement of our sites at the end of their useful lives (see note 5.3) and net
interest charged on the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme obligation (see note 6.3). These are offset by interest income that we generate
through efficient use of short-term cash surpluses – for example through investment in money market funds.
Years ended 31 December

Interest payable and similar charges:

Interest payable on bank borrowings (19.4) (18.0)

Unwinding of discount on provisions (note 5.3) (4.5) (0.7)

Amortisation of deferred finance costs (2.1) (3.7)

Net finance cost in respect of defined benefit scheme (note 6.3) (0.9) (1.1)

Interest receivable:

Interest income on bank deposits 0.6 1.4

Total interest receivable 0.6 1.4

Foreign exchange gains 22.0 5.9

Net interest charge (6.4) (17.0)

Foreign exchange gains and losses recognised in interest arise on the retranslation of balances and investments denominated in foreign
currencies to prevailing rates at the balance sheet date. Sterling weakened against the US dollar and Euro following the EU referendum in June,
resulting in gains being recognised on assets the Group holds denominated in these currencies.

Amortisation of deferred finance costs for the previous period include £0.7 million relating to the previous revolving credit facility for which
amortisation was accelerated following the successful renegotiation of a replacement facility in December 2015.

**2.6 Current and deferred taxation**
The tax charge includes both current and deferred tax. Current tax is the estimated amount of tax payable on this year’s taxable profits
(which are adjusted for items upon which we are not required to pay tax or, in some cases, for items which are not allowable for tax purposes
and therefore on which we are required to pay additional tax). Deferred tax is an accounting adjustment which reflects where more or less tax is
expected to arise in the future due to differences between the accounting and tax rules (reflected in differences between the carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profits). The tax charge reflects
the estimated effective tax rate on profit before tax for the Group for the year ended 31 December 2016 and the movement in the deferred tax
balance in the year, so far as it relates to items recognised in the income statement.

**Accounting policy**
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is based on the taxable profit or loss for the year in the relevant jurisdiction. Taxable
profit or loss differs from profit/loss before tax as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expenditure that
are either taxable or deductible in other years or never taxable/deductible. The Group’s liability (or asset) for current tax is provided at amounts
expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised
for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available
against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on
jurisdictional tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. In the UK 2016 Budget, the UK
Government proposed a reduction in the rate of UK corporation tax from 18% to 17% from 1 April 2020. This change was enacted into law
in September 2016 and accordingly these rates have been reflected in the UK deferred tax balance at 31 December 2016.

Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income
or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.

**132**


-----

**2.6 Current and deferred taxation continued**
**Significant judgement areas**
In accounting for taxation the Group makes assumptions regarding the treatment of items of income and expenditure for tax purposes.
The Group believes that these assumptions are reasonable based on prior experience and consultation with advisers. Full provision is made for
deferred taxation at the rates of tax prevailing at the period end date unless future rates have been substantively enacted. Deferred tax assets
are recognised where it is considered more likely than not that they will be recovered. Where such assets relate to losses incurred by a business
unit, particularly one with a history of losses, the Group seeks evidence other than its own internal forecasts to support recognition of the related
deferred tax asset.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to do so, otherwise are shown separately in the
balance sheet.

In the period the Group recognised a net deferred tax asset valued at £34 million in respect of start-up losses and other temporary differences
in the US-based Drax Biomass business (£21 million of this asset relates to losses that arose in previous years). Recognition in 2016 reflects an
improvement in operational performance and the Board’s increased confidence regarding the delivery of future taxable profits against which the
losses will be utilised currently expected by 2027. As a one-off and non-cash item, this credit has been excluded from the calculation of underlying
earnings and the dividend for 2016 (see notes 2.7 and 2.8). These start-up losses are valued at the US Federal tax rate as was enacted at the
balance sheet date (35%). Should Federal tax rates reduce/increase in the future, this will correspondingly reduce/increase (respectively)
this net deferred tax asset.

The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets with an estimated value of £2 million at 31 December 2016 (2015: £2 million), in respect of UK
losses totalling £12 million, that are carried forward against future taxable income. The business unit involved has a history of making losses and
until sufficient operational performance is established and maintained to give suitable confidence in future profitability, taxable income against
which to utilise the benefit of the accumulated losses is not considered to be probable.

**2.7 Earnings per share and underlying earnings per share**
Earnings per share (EPS) represents the amount of our earnings (post-tax profits) that is attributable to each ordinary share we have in issue.
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing our earnings (profit after tax calculated in accordance with IFRS) by the weighted average number of ordinary
shares that were in issue during the year. Diluted EPS demonstrates the impact if all outstanding share options (such as those to be issued under
our employee share schemes – see note 6.2), that are expected to vest on their future maturity dates, were exercised and treated as ordinary
shares as at the balance sheet date.

In addition to EPS, we calculate underlying EPS as it reflects the figures upon which our annual dividends are calculated (note 2.8). Underlying
EPS removes the post-tax effect of unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts, plus particular transactions considered to be one-off in
nature that do not reflect the underlying trading performance of the Group, from post-tax profits. Multiplying underlying basic EPS by 50% will
give the total dividends per share for the period.

The capacity of the Group to make dividend payments is primarily determined by the availability of retained distributable profits and cash resources.

The immediate cash resources of the Group of £228.4 million are set out in note 4.2 and the recent history of cash generation within note 4.4.
The majority of these cash resources are held by the principal operating subsidiaries of the Group, in particular Drax Power Limited.

The Parent Company financial statements, set out on pages 167 to 172 of this report, disclose the Parent Company’s distributable reserves of £229
million. The Group has, relative to previous dividend payments (note 2.8), sufficient retained profits, which are accessible by the Parent Company,
for future distributions in accordance with the Group’s dividend policy.

SECTION 3:
# OPERATING ASSETS AND WORKING CAPITAL

This section gives further information on the operating assets we use to generate revenue and the short-term liquid assets and liabilities,
managed during day-to-day operations, that comprise our working capital balances.

**3.1 Property, plant and equipment**
This note shows the cost, depreciation and net book value of the physical assets controlled by us that we use in our businesses to generate
revenue. The cost of an asset is what we paid to purchase or construct the asset. Depreciation reflects the usage of the asset over time and is
calculated by taking the cost of the asset, net of any residual value, to the income statement evenly over the useful economic life of the asset.
An asset’s net book value is its cost less any depreciation (including impairment, if required) charged to date.

Additions in 2016 include a further £29 million (2015: £90 million) on our biomass transformation project, which is now largely complete and in line
with initial expectations on timing and overall cost. At Drax Power Station we now have three fully converted units running on biomass fuel, the
third of which completed its conversion following the award of the CfD in December 2016. Upstream, in our US-based wood pellet manufacturing
business, both pellet plant facilities and the port facility ran commercial operations for the first full year.

**Accounting policy**
Property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost. Cost comprises the purchase price (after deducting trade discounts and rebates),
any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner
intended by management, and the estimate of the present value of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site.
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment in value.

We construct many of our assets as part of long-term development projects. Assets that are in the course of construction are not depreciated
until they are ready for us to use in the way intended.

Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write down assets to their residual value evenly over the estimated useful lives (UEL) of the
assets from the date of acquisition (where relevant, limited to the expected decommissioning date of the power station – currently expected to
be 2039). The table below shows the range of useful lives at the date of acquisition and the average remaining useful life at the balance sheet
date of the main categories of asset we own in years:
Average UEL Range of
remaining UELs

Freehold buildings 23 8–32

Plant and equipment

Electricity generation plant 19 3–32

Biomass specific assets 21 4–26

Coal specific assets 23 3–32

Pellet production plant 19 5–20

Other plant, machinery and equipment 15 2–30

Decommissioning asset 23 35

Plant spare parts 23 Up to 35

Freehold land, held at cost, is considered to have an unlimited useful life and is not depreciated.

Electricity generation plant refers to core electricity generation assets at Drax Power Station which are fuel agnostic. Biomass-specific and
coal-specific assets are those assets that are only necessary to support electricity generation from the specified fuel and include fuel storage
and distribution systems.

Within the plant and equipment categories shorter lives are attributed to components that are overhauled and upgraded as part of rolling outage
cycles. The majority of assets within these categories have a remaining useful life in excess of 15 years.

Plant spare parts are depreciated over the remaining useful life of the power station.

Costs relating to major inspections, overhauls and upgrades to the power station are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a
separate asset, as appropriate, if the recognition criteria are met; namely, when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the
item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually, taking into account regulatory change and commercial and technological
obsolescence as well as normal wear and tear. Residual values are based on prices prevailing at each balance sheet date. Any changes are
applied prospectively.

**137**


-----

SECTION 3: OPERATING ASSETS AND WORKING CAPITAL CONTINUED

**3.1 Property, plant and equipment continued**
**Critical judgement areas**
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment where there has been a trigger event (that is, an event which
may have resulted in impairment) by assessing the present value of estimated future cash flows and net realisable value compared with net book
value. The calculation of estimated future cash flows and residual values is based on management’s reasonable estimates of future prices, output
and costs, and is therefore subjective. Estimated useful lives are based on past experience, future replacement cycles and other available
evidence; however an inherent degree of judgement remains.

Asset lives are reviewed annually at each balance sheet date. As part of the most recent annual review of asset lives, the estimated useful life of
coal-specific assets at Drax Power Station will be revised with effect from 1 January 2017. On 9 November 2016 the Government announced a
consultation on the future closure of unabated coal-fired generation. Having considered this event, management concluded that coal generation
will cease during 2025, but that the three coal units will be retained for conversion to biomass-fuelled generation in the period to 2039. This
results in the shortening to 2025 of the useful lives of the coal-specific assets which will not be required to support generation after this date.
This change is applied prospectively, from the point of management’s decision, and will result in an increase of approximately £27 million per
annum in depreciation charges from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2025.

The useful lives of electricity generation plant currently fuelled by coal are unaffected by this change. These assets can be utilised using
alternative fuel sources without material modification.

At each balance sheet date the Group reviews its property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that these assets
may be impaired. Accounting policies in respect of impairment, along with details of the impairment review conducted during 2016, are set out
in note 2.4.

Assets in the course of construction amounted to £120.5 million at 31 December 2016 (2015: £217.0 million). Additions to assets in the course of
construction were £88.6 million in 2016.

**138**


-----

**3.1 Property, plant and equipment continued**
Plant and equipment includes assets held under finance lease agreements with a carrying value at 31 December 2016 of £1.6 million (2015: £1.6 million).

Additions during the year include £nil (2015: £1.9 million) of capitalised borrowing costs directly attributable to the construction of specific assets.

**3.2 ROC and LEC assets**
We earn ROC assets, which are accredited by the Office for Gas and Electricity Markets (“Ofgem”), as a result of burning sustainable compressed
wood pellets to generate electricity. This note sets out the value of these assets that we have earned but not yet sold.

As we generate more of our electricity by burning sustainable compressed wood pellets, the volume and therefore the total value of ROC assets
we have generated has increased. With the approval of the CfD in December 2016, total ROC generation is expected to reduce in 2017. Haven
Power provides us with a credit-efficient and timely route to market for these ROCs, as do the ROC monetisation facilities described in note 7.1.

Following the Government’s decision to remove the Climate Change Levy exemption for power generated from renewable sources, as of
1 August 2015 we no longer earn LECs for electricity generated from sustainable compressed wood pellets.

**Accounting policy**
ROCs are recognised as current assets in the period they are generated and are initially measured at fair value based on anticipated sales prices.
The value of ROCs earned is recognised in the income statement as a reduction in fuel costs in that period.

Where our retail activities incur an obligation to deliver ROCs to Ofgem, that obligation is provided for in the period incurred.

At each reporting date the Group reviews the fair value of ROC assets generated but not sold against updated anticipated sales prices including,
where relevant, agreed forward sale contracts and taking into account likely utilisation of ROCs generated to settle our own ROC obligations.
Any impairments required are recognised in the income statement in the period incurred.

**Critical judgement areas**
The fair values and net realisable values of ROCs referred to above are calculated with reference to assumptions regarding future sales prices in
the market, taking into account agreed forward sale contracts where appropriate. Historic experience indicates that the assumptions used in the
valuation are reasonable; however actual sales prices may differ from those assumed.

ROC valuations also include an estimate of the future benefit that may be obtained from the ROC recycle fund at the end of the compliance
period. The recycle fund provides a benefit where Supplier buy-out charges (incurred by Suppliers who do not procure sufficient ROCs to satisfy
their obligations) are returned to renewable generators on a pro-rata basis. The estimate is based on assumptions about likely levels of renewable
generation and supply over the compliance period and is thus subject to some uncertainty. The Group utilises external sources of information in
addition to its own forecasts in calculating these estimates. Past experience indicates that the values arrived at are reasonable but they remain
subject to possible variation.

SECTION 3: OPERATING ASSETS AND WORKING CAPITAL CONTINUED

**3.3 Inventories**
We hold stocks of fuels and other consumable items that we use in the process of generating electricity, and raw materials used in the production
of compressed wood pellets. This note shows the cost of coal, biomass, other fuels and plant consumables that we held at the end of the year,
including items at Drax Power Station, our facilities in the US and those owned by us but stored in off-site locations.

**Accounting policy**
Our raw materials and fuel stocks are valued at the lower of the weighted average cost to purchase and net realisable value.

The cost of fuel stocks includes all direct costs and overheads incurred in bringing the fuel to its present location and condition, including the
purchase price, import duties and other taxes (including amounts levied on coal under the UK carbon price support mechanism) and transport/
handling costs.

**Critical judgement areas**
Whilst value is largely based on observable costs, given the storage and handling characteristics of coal and biomass, an element of judgement is
inherent in calculating the volume of fuel stocks owned by the Group at any given time.

Both coal and biomass stocks are weighed when entering, moving around or exiting sites using technology regularly calibrated to industry
standards. Fuel burn in the electricity generation process is calculated using a combination of weights and thermal efficiency calculations to
provide closing stock volumes. Both calibrated weighers and efficiency calculations are subject to a range of tolerable error.

Coal stocks are verified by an independent stock survey carried out by a suitably trained specialist, and a provision is made where the survey
indicates a lower level of stock than indicated by the methods described above. Despite being an independent process, the survey depends on
estimates and assumptions and as a result actual values may differ.

The characteristics of biomass require specialist handling and storage. On-site biomass is stored in sealed domes with a carefully controlled
atmosphere for fire prevention purposes. Biomass stock is surveyed using regularly calibrated state-of-the-art RADAR scanning technology.
However, this survey remains subject to a tolerable error range.

Experience indicates that the estimates and assumptions made by management in calculating stock volumes are reasonable. However, actual
values may differ from initial calculations.

(2015: £2.0 million) and £2.0 million of work in progress (2015: £1.8 million) in our biomass supply business.

The cost of inventories recognised as an expense in the year ended 31 December 2016 was £1,173.5 million (2015: £1,306.9 million).

**3.4 Trade and other receivables**
Trade receivables represent amounts owed to us by our customers for goods or services we have provided but not yet been paid for. Other
receivables include accrued income, which is income earned in the period but not yet invoiced, largely in respect of power delivered that will be
invoiced the following month, and prepayments, which are amounts paid by the Group for which we are yet to receive the relevant goods or
services in return (e.g. insurance premiums relating to periods after the balance sheet date).

**Accounting policy**
Trade and other receivables, given their short tenor, are measured at cost. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established where
there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivable.

Accrued income 100.0 157.0

Prepayments and other receivables 105.9 62.8

292.9 319.3

Trade receivables principally represent sales of electricity to counterparties within both our generation and retail businesses. At 31 December
2016, the Group had amounts receivable from four (2015: two) significant counterparties within the generation business, representing 46%
(2015: 41%) of trade receivables, both of which paid within 15 days of receipt of invoice in line with agreed terms.

Of total trade receivables at 31 December 2016, £33.4 million (2015: £41 million) relates to retail power sales. The risk profile of retail debt is
different from that of the generation business with a larger volume of counterparties, and hence a lower concentration of credit risk, with
different payment terms. All past-due receivables are assessed against the Group’s credit risk policies for indicators of impairment and provisions
made where appropriate. The value of retail debts that are past-due and not provided against, in accordance with this assessment, is not material.

Accordingly, management does not consider there to be any requirement for further provisions in excess of the normal provision for doubtful
debts of £4.0 million (2015: £4.9 million). This provision, which largely relates to retail receivables, has been determined with reference to past
default experiences in line with our policies. Credit and counterparty risk are both discussed in further detail in note 7.1.

The movement in the allowance for doubtful debts is laid out in the following table:

**3.5 Trade and other payables**
Trade and other payables represent amounts we owe to our suppliers (for goods and services provided), tax authorities and other creditors that
are due to be paid in the ordinary course of business. We make accruals for amounts that will fall due for payment in the future as a result of our
activities in the current year (e.g. fuel we have received but for which we have not yet been invoiced).

SECTION 4:
# FINANCING AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE

This section gives further information regarding the Group’s capital structure (equity and debt financing) and cash generated from operations
during the year.

**4.1 Reconciliation of net debt**
Net debt is calculated by taking our borrowings (note 4.3) and subtracting cash and cash equivalents (note 4.2). The table below reconciles net
debt in terms of changes in these balances across the year.
Years ended 31 December

2016 2015

Increase in borrowings (1.5) (0.8)

Effect of changes in foreign exchange rates 7.9 1.9

Net debt at 31 December (93.5) (186.6)

The increase in borrowings reflects the accrual of interest on the Group’s term loans (see note 4.3).

**4.2 Cash and cash equivalents**
Cash and cash equivalents include cash held in current and other deposit accounts that are accessible on demand. It is our policy to invest
available cash on hand in short-term, low risk bank or building society deposits.

Cash and cash equivalents 228.4 133.8

**4.3 Borrowings**
Our financing structure includes £325 million of term loans, comprised of a private placement of £100 million with various funds managed by
M&G Investments, a £75 million amortising loan facility with Friends Life, underpinned by a guarantee from HM Treasury under the Infrastructure
UK Guarantee Scheme, a £50 million amortising term loan with Green Investment Bank and a £100 million amortising term loan facility with M&G
UK Companies Financing Fund. The loans have varying maturity profiles ranging from 2017 to 2025. All of the term loans were fully drawn down
at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015.

In addition, the Group has access to a £400 million revolving credit facility (RCF). The facility matures in December 2019 and has a margin of 175
basis points over LIBOR. At 31 December 2016 this facility had been utilised to draw down letters of credit with a total value of £57.9 million
(2015: £37.9 million) (see note 7.5).

The Group also has a commodity trading facility, which allows us to transact prescribed volumes of commodity trades without the requirement to
post collateral.

**Accounting policy**
The Group measures all debt instruments (whether financial assets or financial liabilities) initially at fair value, which equates to the principal value
of the consideration paid or received. Subsequent to initial measurement, debt instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method. Transaction costs (any such costs incremental and directly attributable to the issue of the financial instrument) are included in
the calculation of the effective interest rate and are amortised through the income statement over the life of the instrument.

Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of
the facility will be drawn down. Where this is the case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs.

**Analysis of borrowings**
Borrowings at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 consisted principally of amounts drawn down against bank loans.

**4.5 Equity and reserves**
Our ordinary share capital reflects the total number of shares in issue, which are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange.

**Accounting policy**
Ordinary shares are classified as equity as evidenced by their residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting its liabilities.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

SECTION 5:
# OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

This section provides information on the assets and liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheet that are not covered in other sections,
including goodwill, other intangible assets and the provision for reinstatement.

**5.1 Acquisitions**
**Accounting policy**
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are recognised at the point the Group obtains control of the target (the acquisition date). The
consideration transferred and the assets and liabilities acquired are measured at their fair value on the acquisition date. The assets and liabilities
acquired are recognised in the Consolidated balance sheet and the profits of the acquired business are recognised in the Consolidated income
statement from the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement in the period the acquisition occurs.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.

**Acquisitions in the financial year**
The transactions in this section occurred in the year ended 31 December 2016 and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements.

**Acquisition of four OCGT development projects**
On 6 December 2016 the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Progress Power Limited (PPL), Hirwaun Power Limited (HPL),
Millbrook Power Limited (MPL) and Abergelli Power Limited (APL). PPL, HPL, MPL and APL each hold a proposed development option, on land
located in England and Wales, for a 299MW Open-Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) project. Both PPL and HPL have obtained Development Consent
Orders for their sites. The acquisitions represent diversification of our generation capability in response to the changing energy requirements
of the UK.

Initial consideration of £18.6 million was settled in cash on 3 January 2017, with the amount held as a liability in the balance sheet at 31 December
2016. The final purchase price depends upon future clearing prices in T-4 capacity market auctions from 2016–2020. The range of possible
outcomes being zero further consideration if the capacity market clearing price does not exceed £28/KW in these auctions, with a maximum
contingent consideration payable of £72 million, based on a clearing price of £75/KW. The fair value of the contingent consideration at 31 December
2016 was assessed at £3.8 million based on a projection of likely future capacity market clearing prices, discounted to present value at a risk free
rate of 2%.

The provisional amounts recognised in respect of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of the four companies,
and measured at fair value, are set out in the table below:
PPL HPL MPL APL Total

Comprised of:

Initial consideration payable on 3 January 2017 in cash 7.4 7.4 1.9 1.9 18.6

Fair value of contingent consideration 1.9 1.9 – – 3.8

The intangible development assets identified as part of the acquisitions represent the value of planning and consent obtained for each site.
No cash or cash equivalents were acquired in the transaction, therefore the net cash outflow on acquisition was £18.6 million.

The four acquired companies did not trade in the period between the acquisition date and the balance sheet, and no further costs were incurred.
Accordingly, the Consolidated income statement includes no revenue or EBITDA in respect of the acquired companies. Transaction costs of
£0.7 million were recognised as an expense in the period.

**Acquisitions after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements were approved**
The following disclosures relate to acquisitions completed between 1 January and 15 February 2017.

**146**


-----

**5.1 Acquisitions continued**
**Acquisition of Opus Energy Group Limited**
On 6 December 2016, the Group announced the proposed acquisition of Opus Energy Group Limited (Opus Energy) for a consideration of
£340 million, plus interest calculated on the amount of Opus Energy’s net assets from 31 March 2016 to the acquisition completion date.

Opus Energy is a well-established energy retail business serving business customers in the SME market. The transaction represents a
diversification of the Group’s retail offering, strengthening our presence in the SME market, and provides a range of strategic and financial
benefits. Opus Energy is expected to contribute positively to earnings and cash flow immediately following the acquisition and the combination
provides a robust platform for future growth.

The transaction was approved by shareholders on 8 February 2017 and subsequently completed on 10 February 2017, the Group acquired 100%
of the issued share capital on this date.

Total consideration paid in cash, including interest as described above, amounted to £367 million. No deferred or contingent consideration is
payable. The acquisition was funded by a combination of existing cash reserves and a new £375 million loan facility which was partially drawn on
10 February 2017. Further details regarding the new facility are disclosed in note 4.3.

Given the short period of time between the transaction completion date and the approval of these financial statements, the initial accounting
for the business combination is not complete. The table below provides the approximate acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed in the transaction based as the most recently available management information. These figures, including the indicative
goodwill, are provisional.
Total
£m

Financial assets 169.9

Property, plant and equipment 5.6

Financial liabilities (130.3)

Total identifiable net assets 45.2

Goodwill 322.1

Fair value of consideration payable 367.3

The provisional goodwill reflects the economic and strategic benefits described above. A full review and finalisation of identifiable intangible
assets acquired will be completed before the initial accounting for the transaction is completed. Accordingly, the amount of goodwill recognised
in the financial statements may be lower than indicated above.

The provisional financial assets acquired include £170 million of receivables, the majority of which reflect trade receivables for energy supplied
to customers measured at cost. By virtue of their short tenor, the contractual amounts receivable and the fair value of these receivables are
considered to be the same. A provision for doubtful debts of £3 million is included within the values above and reflects the best estimate of the
contractual cash flows not expected to be recovered.

As the transaction completed after the balance sheet date, there are no amounts included in these financial statements in respect of the
transaction other than transaction costs of £1.6 million incurred before 31 December 2016, which have been recognised as an expense in
Operating and administrative costs in the income statement.

SECTION 5: OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CONTINUED

**5.2 Goodwill and other intangible assets**
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of a business when the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the assets acquired. Our goodwill relates to
the acquisition of Haven Power in 2009 and Billington Bioenergy in 2015. Other intangibles include development assets recognised on the
acquisition of four OCGT development projects in 2016 and amounts paid in respect of carbon emission allowances for future years.

**Accounting policy**
Goodwill is initially recognised and measured at the acquisition date. Goodwill is not amortised but reviewed for impairment at least annually.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the CGU to which it relates and the recoverable amount for that CGU assessed.
Intangibles are recognised at fair value or cost.


The table shows movements and balances:

Cost and carrying amount:


Goodwill

At 1 January 2015 10.7 – – 10.7

Additions at cost – 21.0 0.7 21.7

At 31 December 2016 14.5 21.0 0.7 36.2

**Goodwill**
Total goodwill in the Consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 was £14.5 million, with £10.7 million arising on the
acquisition of Haven Power in 2009 attributed to the Haven Power CGU and £3.8 million arising on the acquisition of Billington Bioenergy in 2015
attributable to the Billington Bioenergy CGU.

The recoverable amount of both the Haven Power and Billington Bioenergy CGUs is calculated annually, based on a value in use calculation. The
approach for this calculation is the same as that used for the wider asset impairment review conducted by the Group as at 31 December 2016 and
is disclosed in note 2.4. At 31 December 2016, the value in use of goodwill was significantly in excess of its book value in both the Haven Power
and Billington Bioenergy CGUs.

**Development assets**
The development assets arose on the acquisition of four OCGT projects in December 2016 (see note 5.1) and reflect the value of planning and
consents acquired as part of that transaction. They were measured at fair value on acquisition and will be amortised over the expected period of
useful economic life of the projects once they reach commercial operations. Until operations commence, the assets are considered to have an
indefinite life and thus will be subject to impairment testing at each balance sheet date.

At 31 December 2016, given the short time since the acquisition of the assets, management consider the fair value of the development assets to
be equivalent to the purchase price.

**Carbon assets**
Carbon assets arise on the purchase of CO2 emissions allowances in excess of the amount allocated under the ETS and required for the current
financial year, and are measured at cost, net of any impairment.

The charge to the income statement, within fuel costs, reflects the cost of emissions allowances required to satisfy the obligation for the current
year and takes into account generation and market purchases allocated to the current financial year, and to the extent further purchases are
required, the market price at the balance sheet date.

**148**


-----

**5.3 Provisions**
We make provision for reinstatement to cover the estimated costs of decommissioning and demolishing our generation assets and remediating
the site at the end of the useful economic lives of the assets. The amount represents the discounted present value of the expected costs.

**Accounting policy**
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group
will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

Specifically, provision is made for the estimated decommissioning costs at the end of the useful economic life of the Group’s generating assets,
when a legal or constructive obligation arises, on a discounted basis. The amount provided represents the present value of the expected costs.
In view of the uncertainty of assessing the amount of any proceeds from the disposal of the assets at the decommissioning date, no reduction
in the provision is made for any such proceeds. The discount rate used is a risk free pre-tax rate of 1.9% (2015: 2.4%), reflecting the fact that the
estimated future cash flows have built in risks specific to the liability. An amount equivalent to the discounted provision is capitalised within
property, plant and equipment and is depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets. The unwinding of the discount is included in interest
payable and similar charges.

Unwinding of discount 0.7

At 1 January 2016 30.5

Unwinding of discount 0.8

Adjustment for change in discount rate 3.7

At 31 December 2016 35.0

The provision is estimated using the assumption that the decommissioning and reinstatement will take place at the end of the expected useful
life of the power station in 2039, and has been estimated using existing technology at current prices based on independent third party advice,
updated on a triennial basis. The most recent update took place in December 2014.

**6.2 Share-based payments**
We operate two share option schemes for our employees – the BMP for directors and senior executives, and the Savings-Related Share Option
Plan (SAYE) for all qualifying employees. We incur a non-cash charge in respect of these schemes in our income statement, which is set out below
along with a detailed description of each scheme and the number of options outstanding.

**Accounting policy**
All of the Group’s share-based payments are equity-settled. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at the fair value of the equity
instrument at the date of grant and expensed on a straight-line basis over the relevant vesting period, based on an estimate of the shares that will
ultimately vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions, which is revised at each balance sheet date.

**Share Incentive Plan (SIP)**
Between 2008 and 2010, qualifying employees could buy up to £1,500 worth of Partnership Shares in any one tax year. Matching shares
were awarded to employees to match any shares they bought, in a ratio of one-to-one, with the cost of matching shares borne by the Group.
There have been no awards under the SIP Partnership and Matching Share plan since 2010.

Shares in the Company held under trust and under the Company’s control as a result of the SIP were as follows:

**Bonus Matching Plan**
Under the BMP, annual awards of performance and service-related shares are made for no consideration to executive directors and other senior
executives up to a maximum of 150% of their annual bonus. A proportion of the shares vesting is conditional upon whether the Group’s Total
Shareholder Return (TSR) matches or outperforms an index (determined in accordance with the scheme rules) over three years and a proportion
of the shares vesting is conditional upon performance against the internal balanced corporate scorecard. The fair value of the 2016, 2015 and
2014 BMP awards, of £2.6 million, £3.3 million and £5.4 million respectively, is being charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over
the corresponding three year vesting periods.

The fair value of BMP awards is calculated using a Monte-Carlo valuation model, which takes into account the estimated probability of different
levels of vesting. The key inputs to the valuation model for the 2016 awards are the share price at the grant date (249.7 pence), expected volatility
(41%), and risk free interest rate (0.45%). The fair value of each option granted was 153 pence.

At 31 December 3,193,932 3,411,792

50% of the BMP options granted in 2016 will vest conditional on Group TSR relative to the TSR of a comparator group of companies with the
remaining 50% vesting conditional upon the internal balanced corporate scorecard (2015: 50% TSR-linked, 50% scorecard-linked). The share price
on the grant date for BMP options awarded in the year was 250 pence (2015: 397 pence) and the weighted average fair value of the BMP options
granted during the year was 153 pence (2015: 213 pence).

For the BMP options exercised during the period, the weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 232 pence (2015: 397 pence).

All of the BMP options outstanding at the end of the period had an exercise price of £nil (2015: £nil). The weighted average remaining contractual
life was 17 months (2015: 14 months).

The number of options exercisable at the year end was nil (2015: nil).

SECTION 6: OUR PEOPLE CONTINUED

**6.2 Share-based payments continued**
**Savings-Related Share Option Plan (SAYE)**
In April 2016, participation in the SAYE Plan was offered again to all qualifying employees. Options were granted for employees to acquire shares
at a price of 203 pence (2015: 319 pence), representing a discount of 20% to the prevailing market price determined in accordance with the
scheme rules. The options are exercisable at the end of three or five year savings contracts. The fair value of the options granted in connection
with the SAYE Plan of £3.9 million (2015: £4.4 million) is being charged to the income statement over the term of the relevant contracts.

At 31 December 3,286,906 996,709 1,948,209 934,041

The fair value of SAYE awards is calculated using a Black-Scholes model, which compares exercise price to share price at the date of grant.

The fair value of SAYE options granted and the inputs to the option pricing model used in the current and previous year are set out in the table
below:

5 April 5 April 2 April 2 April

Grant date 2016 2016 2015 2015

Share price at grant date (pence) 286 286 399 399

Expected volatility 40.0% 37.6% 43.0% 43.0%

Fair value of options granted (pence) 101 82 142 160

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous three and five years
respectively. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability,
exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.

For the SAYE options exercised during the period, the weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 337 pence (2015: 400 pence).

The weighted average exercise price of SAYE options outstanding at the end of the period was 216 pence (2015: 331 pence). The weighted
average remaining contractual life was 31 months (2015: 32 months).

The number of options exercisable at the year end was nil (2015: 10,894).

Additional information in relation to the Group’s share-based incentive plans is included in the Remuneration Committee report.

**6.3 Retirement benefit obligations**
We operate a defined benefit and three defined contribution pension schemes.

The Drax Power Group (DPG) section of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme (ESPS) is a defined benefit scheme; a pension arrangement under
which participating members receive a pension benefit at retirement determined by the scheme rules. Members are typically entitled to an
annual pension on retirement of 1/80th of final pensionable salary for each year of service plus a tax-free lump sum of three times pension.

The Drax Group Personal Pension Plan, Haven Power Personal Pension Plan and Drax Biomass Inc. 401(K) Plan are defined contribution schemes,
which provide a retirement benefit that is dependent upon actual contributions made by the Group and members of the relevant scheme.

**152**


-----

**6.3 Retirement benefit obligations continued**
**Accounting policy**
Payments to defined contribution schemes are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered services that entitle them to the
contributions.

For the defined benefit pension scheme, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial
valuations being carried out at the end of each reporting period. Remeasurement of the obligation, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the
effect of the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on scheme assets (excluding interest), is recognised immediately in the balance sheet with
a charge or credit to the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which it occurs. Defined benefit costs, including current service
costs, past service costs and gains and losses on curtailments and settlements are recognised in the income statement as part of operating
and administrative expenses in the period in which they occur. The net interest expense is recognised in finance costs.

The income statement charge for the defined contribution scheme represents the contributions due to be paid by the Group in respect of the
current period.

**Significant judgement areas**
Measurement of the defined benefit obligation using the projected unit credit method involves the use of key assumptions, including discount
rates, inflation rates, salary and pension increases, and mortality rates. These actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually and modified as
appropriate. The Group believes that the assumptions utilised in measuring obligations under the scheme are reasonable based on prior
experience, market conditions and the advice of scheme actuaries. However, actual results may differ from such assumptions.

The assumptions applied in 2016 have been prepared on a consistent basis with those in the previous period and in accordance with independent
actuarial advice received.

**Defined contribution schemes**
The Group operates three defined contribution schemes, The Drax Group Personal Pension Plan, Haven Power Personal Pension Plan and Drax
Biomass inc. 401(K) Plan, for all qualifying employees. Pension costs for the defined contribution schemes are as follows:

Years ended 31 December

2016 2015
£m £m

Total included in staff costs (note 6.1) 5.6 5.9

As at 31 December 2016, contributions of £0.5 million (2015: £0.4 million) due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to
the schemes. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.

**Defined benefit scheme**
The DPG section of the ESPS was closed to new members as from 1 January 2002 unless they qualify through being existing members of another
part of the ESPS. Members who joined before this date continue to build up pension benefits as part of the scheme.

The DPG ESPS exposes the Group to actuarial and other risks, the most significant of which are considered to be:

Investment risk The scheme liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if assets underperform
this yield, this will create a deficit. The scheme holds a significant proportion of growth assets (equities, property and direct
lending) which, though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, create volatility and risk in the short term.
The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the scheme’s long term objectives.

Discount rate risk A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed upon the scheme’s liabilities, although this will be partially
offset by an increase in the value of the scheme’s bond holdings.

Longevity risk The majority of the scheme’s obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will
result in an increase in the liabilities of the scheme.

Inflation risk The majority of the scheme’s obligations to pay benefits are linked to inflation, and as such higher inflation will lead to higher
liabilities. The majority of the assets held by the scheme are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, such
that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit. In most cases, caps on inflationary increases are in place, to protect
against extreme inflation.

SECTION 6: OUR PEOPLE CONTINUED

**6.3 Retirement benefit obligations continued**
Other risks include operational risks (such as paying out the wrong benefits), legislative risks (such as the Government increasing the burden
on pension schemes through new legislation) and other demographic risks (such as making a higher proportion of members with dependants
eligible to receive pensions from the Group). The Trustees insure certain benefits payable on death before retirement.

A contingent liability exists in relation to the equalisation of Guaranteed Minimum Pension. See note 7.5 for details.

The most recent funding valuation of the DPG ESPS carried out by Aon Hewitt, a qualified independent actuary, as at 31 March 2016 is not
yet complete; however the actuarial review at 31 December 2016 is based on the same membership and other data as the initial results of this
funding valuation. The scheme board accepted the advice of the actuary and approved the use of these assumptions for the purpose of
assessing the scheme cost. Future valuations are required by law at intervals of no more than three years.

The results of the latest funding valuation at 31 March 2016 have been adjusted to the balance sheet date, taking into account experience over
the period since 31 March 2016, changes in market conditions and differences in financial and demographic assumptions. The present value of
the defined benefit obligation, and the related current service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method. The principal
assumptions used, which reflect the nature and term of the scheme liabilities, are as follows:
As at 31 December

2016 2015
% p.a. % p.a.

Discount rate 2.8 3.9

Inflation (RPI) 3.2 3.1

Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.1 3.0

Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.8 3.7

Mortality assumptions are based on recent actual mortality experience of scheme members and allow for expected future improvements in
mortality rates. The assumptions are that a member aged 60 in 2016 will live, on average, for a further 27 years if they are male (2015: 27 years)
and for a further 29 years if they are female (2015: 29 years). Life expectancy at age 60 for male and female non-pensioners currently aged 45
is assumed to be 28 and 31 years respectively (2015: 28 and 31 years respectively).

The net liability recognised in the balance sheet is the excess of the present value of the defined benefit obligation over the fair value of the plan
assets, determined as follows:
As at 31 December

2016 2015
£m £m

Defined benefit obligation 311.4 244.6

Fair value of plan assets (281.3) (215.1)

Benefits paid (7.6) (7.2)

Defined benefit obligation at 31 December 311.4 244.6

The actuarial losses of £58.8 million (2015: £5.8 million gains) reflect losses of £71.4 million arising from changes in financial assumptions
(2015: gains of £2.3 million), offset by £1.9 million gains arising from changes in demographic assumptions and gains arising from scheme
experience of £10.7 million (2015: gains of £1.8 million and £1.7 million respectively).

The losses due to changes in financial assumptions principally reflect the increase in the present value of the scheme liabilities arising as a result
of the change in discount rate assumption to 2.75% (2015: 3.9%) following reductions in corporate bond yields.

Changes in the fair value of plan assets are as follows:

Employer contributions included payments totalling £8.3 million (2015: £5.1 million) to reduce the actuarial deficit.

The actual return on plan assets in the period was £58.9 million (2015: £3.2 million).

The fair values of the major categories of plan assets were as follows:
As at 31 December

Fair value of total plan assets 281.3 215.1

Notes:
(1) At 31 December 2016 the scheme’s long-term asset strategy was: global equity (20%), direct lending (10%), emerging market equity (5%), fixed interest bonds (15%), corporate bonds (6%), liability
driven investing (29%) and long lease property (15%).
(2) Fixed interest bonds include a mixture of corporate, Government and absolute return bonds. Approximately 27% of the bonds have a sub-investment grade credit rating (i.e. BB+ or lower).
(3) Other assets include £19.1 million of investments in direct lending, a type of private equity vehicle, which is not quoted in an active market (2015: £7.9 million).

SECTION 6: OUR PEOPLE CONTINUED

**6.3 Retirement benefit obligations continued**
The pension plan assets do not include any ordinary shares issued by Drax Group plc or any property occupied by the Group.

The Group employs a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return on pension plan assets. Historical markets are studied
and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles. The overall
expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return for each asset class relative to the actual asset allocation
for the scheme.

The assumptions for discount rate, inflation rate, rate of increase in pensions paid and expected return on plan assets all have a potentially
significant effect on the measurement of the scheme deficit. The following table provides an indication of the sensitivity of the pension deficit
at 31 December 2016 to changes in these assumptions:

(Decrease)/
Increase in
net liability

% £m

Discount rate – Increase 0.25 (15.6)

– Decrease 0.25 16.2

Inflation rate[(1)] – Increase 0.25 (14.0)

– Decrease 0.25 13.6

Life expectancy – Increase 1 year (10.9)

– Decrease 1 year 11.0

Note:
(1) The sensitivity of the scheme liabilities to salary and pension increases is closely correlated with inflation.

The Group is exposed to investment and other experience risks, as described above, and may need to make additional contributions where it is
estimated that the benefits will not be met from regular contributions and expected investment income.

As at 31 December

2016 2015 2014 2013 2012
£m £m £m £m £m

Defined benefit obligation (311.4) (244.6) (242.1) (220.9) (199.0)

Fair value of plan assets 281.3 215.1 207.8 179.2 156.9

Deficit (30.1) (29.5) (34.3) (41.7) (42.1)

Experience adjustments on plan liabilities 10.7 1.7 1.6 8.7 (1.7)

Experience adjustments on plan assets 50.4 (4.6) 13.6 9.4 (3.0)

The defined benefit obligation includes benefits for current employees of the Group (60%), former employees of the Group who are yet to retire
(5%) and retired pensioners (35%). The weighted-average period over which benefit payments are expected to be made, or the duration of the
scheme liabilities, was assessed at the 31 March 2016 funding valuation to be 21 years.

The Group expects to contribute £23.8 million to the defined benefit pension plan during the 12 months ended 31 December 2017 and make
regular deficit contributions over the period to 2025.

The Group intends to fund the deficit, agreed at the 31 March 2013 funding valuation, over the period to 31 December 2019.

SECTION 7:
# RISK MANAGEMENT

This section provides disclosures around financial risk management, including the financial instruments we use to mitigate such risks.

**7.1 Financial risk management**
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, liquidity risk,
counterparty risk and credit risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of commodity and financial
markets and seeks to manage potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance.

The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. Risk management is carried out by the risk management
committees as explained in Principal risks and uncertainties (page 55) which identify, evaluate and hedge financial risks in close coordination
with the Group’s trading function under policies approved by the Board of directors.

**Commodity price risk**
The Group is exposed to the effect of fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly the price of electricity, the price of coal, sustainable wood
fibre and pellets and other fuels, and the price of CO2 emissions allowances. Price variations and market cycles have historically influenced the
financial results of the Group and are expected to continue to do so.

The Group has a policy of securing forward power sales, purchases of fuel and CO2 emissions allowances when profitable to do so.
All commitments to sell power under fixed price contracts are designated as cash flow hedges as they reduce the Group’s cash flow
exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of electricity.

The Group purchases coal, sustainable biomass and other fuels under either fixed or variable priced contracts with different maturities from a
variety of domestic and international sources. All international physical coal purchase contracts transacted at a fixed price and financial coal
contracts exchanging floating price coal for fixed price amounts are designated as cash flow hedges as they reduce the Group’s cash flow
exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of coal.

The Group purchases CO2 emissions allowances under fixed price contracts with different maturity dates from a range of domestic and
international sources. All commitments to purchase CO2 emissions allowances under fixed price contracts are designated as cash flow hedges
as they reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of CO2 emissions allowances.

**Commodity price sensitivity**
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to commodity prices for outstanding monetary items at the balance
sheet date. The analysis is based on the Group’s commodity financial instruments held at each balance sheet date.

If commodity prices had been 5% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s:

– profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2016 would increase/decrease by £3.4 million (2015: decrease/increase by £6.7 million). –
This is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure to oil derivatives; and
– the hedge reserve would increase/decrease by £36.3 million (2015: decrease/increase by £11.5 million) mainly as a result of the changes in the –
fair value of financial coal and power derivatives.

**Interest rate risk**
Historically the Group has been exposed to interest rate risk principally in relation to its bank debt, and has sought to mitigate this risk with
interest rate hedges on a proportion of its debt facilities. The Group has no interest rate swaps outstanding at the balance sheet date; however
this risk management tool remains available to the Group. Information about the Group’s instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk and
their repayment schedules is provided below.

**Interest rate sensitivity**
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet
date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was
outstanding for the whole year.

If interest rates had been 1% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit after tax and net assets for the year ended
31 December 2016 would decrease/increase by £1.8 million (2015: decrease/increase by £1.8 million) as a result of the changes in interest payable
during the period.

**157**


-----

SECTION 7: RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED

**7.1 Financial risk management continued**
**Foreign currency risk**
Forward foreign currency exchange contracts are entered into in order to hedge fixed price international coal purchases in US dollars,
wood pellet purchases in US dollars, Canadian dollars and Euros, and CO2 emissions allowances purchases in Euros.

Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising a variety of foreign currency exchange contracts. The Group
enters into forward currency purchase contracts to hedge its anticipated foreign currency requirements over a rolling five-year period for both
contracted and forecast transactions.

**Foreign currency sensitivity**
If sterling exchange rates had been 5% stronger/weaker against other currencies and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s:

– profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2016 would decrease/increase by £252.6 million/£277.7 million (2015: decrease/increase by –
£233.0 million/£241.1 million). This is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure to foreign currency exchange contracts entered in relation to
fuel purchase contracts; and
– other equity reserves would increase/decrease by £78.7 million/£87 million (2015: increase/decrease by £67.8 million/£75.0 million) as a result –
of the changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts.

**Liquidity risk**
The treasury function is responsible for liquidity, funding and settlement management under policies approved by the Board of directors. Liquidity
needs are monitored using regular forecasting of operational cash flows and financing commitments. The Group maintains a mixture of cash and
cash equivalents, and committed facilities in order to ensure sufficient funding for business requirements.

The following tables set out details of the expected contractual maturity of non-derivative financial liabilities. The tables include both interest
and principal cash flows. To the extent that interest flows are floating rate, the undiscounted amount is derived from interest rate curves at the
balance sheet date.

1,252.2 921.0 1,786.2 3,959.4

In managing liquidity risk, the Group has access to facilities that enable it to accelerate the cash flows associated with certain of its receivables
(principally those related to ROC sales and retail power sales). Each of these facilities is provided on a non-recourse basis and accordingly
receivables sold under each facility are derecognised from the balance sheet at the point of sale. At the balance sheet date there was
£111.1 million utilised under ROC agreements and £74.4 million utilised under Receivable financing agreements.

**Counterparty risk**
As the Group relies on third party suppliers for the delivery of currency, coal, sustainable compressed wood pellets and other goods and services,
it is exposed to the risk of non-performance by these third party suppliers. If a large supplier were to fall into financial difficulty and/or fail to deliver
against its contract with the Group, there would be additional costs associated with securing the lost goods or services from other suppliers.

The Group enters into contracts for the sale of electricity to a number of counterparties. The failure of one or more of these counterparties to
perform their contractual obligations may cause the Group financial distress or increase the risk profile of the Group.

**Credit risk**
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the balance sheet date, as summarised below:

As at 31 December

2016 2015
£m £m

Financial assets:

Cash and cash equivalents 228.4 133.8

Trade and other receivables 296.9 324.2

Derivative financial instruments 891.3 609.2

1,416.6 1,067.2

Trade and other receivables are stated gross of the provision for doubtful debts of £4.0 million (2015: £4.9 million).

Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by risk management committees. Where considered
appropriate, counterparties are required to provide credit support in the form of a parent company guarantee, letter of credit, deed of charge,
or cash collateral. In addition, where deemed appropriate the Group has historically purchased credit default swaps.

The investment of surplus cash is undertaken to maximise the return within Board approved policies. These policies manage credit risk exposure
by setting out minimum rating requirements, maximum investment with any one counterparty and the maturity profile.

SECTION 7: RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED

**7.1 Financial risk management continued**
**Capital management**
The Group manages its capital to ensure it is able to continue as a going concern, and maintain its credit rating while maximising the return to
shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders’ equity
(excluding the hedge reserve), plus net debt. Net debt is comprised of borrowings disclosed in note 4.3 and cash and cash equivalents in note 4.2.

As at 31 December

2016 2015
£m £m

Borrowings 321.9 320.4

Cash and cash equivalents (228.4) (133.8)

Net debt 93.5 186.6

Total shareholders’ equity, excluding hedge reserve 1,739.8 1,567.5

**Dividend policy**
It is the Group’s policy to distribute 50% of underlying profit after tax to shareholders each year. The policy is designed to ensure dividends
reflect the underlying trading performance of the business whilst retaining sufficient cash within the Group to support strategic development
objectives and working capital requirements. Underlying earnings are based on earnings calculated in accordance with IFRS adjusted to exclude
the post-tax impact of unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts and any other one-off or otherwise exceptional items that the Board
considers to be unrepresentative of the Group’s trading and operational performance.

**7.2 Derivative financial instruments**
We enter into forward contracts for the purchase and sale of physical commodities (principally power, gas, coal, sustainable biomass and CO2
emissions allowances) to secure market level bark and dark green spreads on future electricity sales, and also financial contracts (principally
currency exchange contracts and financial coal and oil derivatives) to fix Sterling cash flows.

We hold these contracts for risk management purposes, to manage key risks facing the business including commodity price risk and foreign
currency risk (see note 7.1).

A successful commercial hedging strategy is critical to our business model. Our policy is to fix exposures to commodity price movements and
changes in foreign exchange rates using derivative contracts such as those described above. This strategy aims to de-risk the business, providing
security and certainty over cash flows into the future. As at 31 December 2016, due to the weakening of Sterling against the US dollar, our forward
derivative contracts, consisting largely of forward contracts for the purchase of foreign currencies (principally for the purpose of fixing the
Sterling cost of sustainable compressed wood pellet purchases), increased to £545.1 million (2015: £143 million) thereby protecting the Group to
that extent from the increased cost of future supplies denominated in foreign currencies from the weakness of Sterling.

**Accounting policy**
At the balance sheet date all contracts (subject to certain exemptions described below) must be measured at fair value, which is in essence the
difference between the price we have secured in the contract, and the price we could achieve in the market at that point in time.

Changes in fair value are recognised either within the income statement or the hedge reserve, dependent upon whether the contract in question
qualifies as an effective hedge under IFRS (see note 7.4).

Where possible, the Group has taken advantage of the own use exemption which allows qualifying contracts to be excluded from fair value
mark-to-market accounting. This applies to certain contracts for physical commodities entered into and held for our own purchase, sale or usage
requirements, including forward contracts for the purchase of biomass, and coal from domestic sources.

Contracts which do not qualify for the own use exemption – principally power, gas, financial oil, financial coal, CO2 emissions allowances and
forward foreign currency exchange contracts – are accounted for as derivatives in accordance with IAS 39 and are recorded in the balance sheet
at fair value, with changes in fair value reflected through the hedge reserve (note 7.4) to the extent that the contracts are designated as effective
hedges in accordance with IAS 39, or the income statement where the hedge accounting requirements are not met. The Group enters into
forward contracts solely for the purpose of financial risk management and considers all of its contracts to be economic hedges, regardless of
whether the specific criteria for hedge accounting are met.

Derivative financial instruments with a maturity date within 12 months from the balance sheet date are classified as current assets or liabilities.
Instruments with a maturity date beyond 12 months are classified as non-current assets or liabilities.

**Critical judgement areas**
The fair values of derivative instruments for commodities and foreign currency exchange contracts are determined using forward price curves.
Forward price curves represent the Group’s estimates of the prices at which a buyer or seller could contract today for delivery or settlement of
a commodity or foreign exchange payment or receipt, at future dates. The Group generally bases forward price curves upon readily obtainable
market price quotations, as the Group’s commodity and forward foreign exchange contracts do not generally extend beyond the actively traded
portion of these curves. However, the forward price curves used are only an estimate of how future prices will move and are, therefore, subjective.
Where derivative financial instruments include options these are valued using an option pricing model. Inputs to the model include market
commodity prices, forward price curves, the term of the option, discount rate and assumptions around volatility based on historical movements.
The inputs include assumptions around future transactions and market movements, as well as credit risk and are, therefore, subjective.

**Fair value accounting**
Forward contracts for the sale of power, purchase of coal from international sources, purchase of CO2 emissions allowances, financial coal,

SECTION 7: RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED

**7.2 Derivative financial instruments continued**
The total movement in the fair value of these contracts of £506.9 million (2015: £147.1 million gain) is recognised in the income statement or the
hedge reserve, dependent upon whether the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 are met, as follows:
Years ended 31 December

2016 2015
£m £m

Unrealised gains on derivative contracts recognised in arriving at operating profit 176.8 123.7

Unrealised gains on derivative contracts recognised in the hedge reserve (note 7.4) 330.1 23.4

Total unrealised gains on derivative contracts 506.9 147.1

We maintain a substantial foreign currency hedging programme to secure the sterling cost of future purchases of fuel in foreign currencies.
The vast majority of our fuel purchases, and therefore our currency exchange contracts, are denominated in US dollars. Compared to market
exchange rates immediately prior to the EU referendum in June 2016, Sterling depreciated by approximately 15–20% against the US dollar by the
balance sheet date. As a result, combined with the high volume of such contracts held (shown in the table on page 161), the net unrealised gains
recognised in the year principally reflect the value of our forward currency purchase contract portfolio.

A material proportion of these contracts are not designated in hedge accounting relationships under IAS 39 and thus the gains on these
contracts were recognised in the income statement.

Unrealised gains recognised in the hedge reserve principally reflect gains on the portion of our forward currency exchange contracts that are
designated in effective hedge relationships in accordance with IAS 39.

**Fair value measurement**

–– Commodity contracts fair value – The fair value of open commodity contracts that do not qualify for the own use exemption is calculated by
reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date. As contracts are generally short-term, forward market price curves are available
for the duration of the contracts. The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price; the quoted price
for financial liabilities is the current ask price.
–– Forward foreign currency exchange contracts fair value – The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts is determined using
forward currency exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
–– Other financial contracts fair value – The fair value of other financial contracts that do not qualify for the own use exemption, is calculated by
reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date. As contracts are generally short-term, forward market price curves are available
for the duration of the contracts.

The fair values of all derivative financial instruments are discounted to reflect the credit risk inherent within the instrument.

The Group has reviewed all significant contracts for the presence of embedded derivatives. Where contracts were found to contain embedded
derivatives, they were considered to be closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, and therefore do not require
separate valuation from their host contracts.

We are required by IFRS to categorise our financial instruments in accordance with the following hierarchy in order to explain the basis on which
their fair values have been determined:

Level 1 – fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2 – fair value measurements are those derived from inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the
asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
Level 3 – fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on
observable market data (unobservable inputs).

Categorisation within this fair value measurement hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the
fair value measurement of the relevant asset or liability.

The fair value of commodity contracts, forward foreign currency exchange contracts and the contingent consideration in the OCGT acquisition
(see note 5.1) are largely determined by comparison between forward market prices and the contract price; therefore these contracts are
categorised as Level 2.

There have been no transfers during the year between Level 1, 2 or 3 category inputs.

**162**


-----

**7.3 Other financial instruments**
We hold a variety of other non-derivative financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, payables and receivables arising
from our operations.

**Accounting policy**
Cash and cash equivalents (note 4.2), trade and other receivables (note 3.4), and trade and other payables (note 3.5) generally have short times to
maturity. For this reason their carrying values, on the historical cost basis, approximate to their fair value. The Group’s borrowings (note 4.3) relate
principally to amounts drawn down against term loans, the carrying amounts of which approximate their fair values by virtue of being floating
rate instruments.

**7.4 Hedge reserve**
Changes in the fair value of our derivative commodity, financial and currency contracts are recognised in the hedge reserve, to the extent that
they qualify as effective hedges under accounting rules. The cumulative gains and losses unwind and are released as the related contracts
mature and we take delivery of the associated commodity or currency.

As described in note 7.2, all of our derivative contracts are entered into for the purpose of commercial hedging; however, not all of these contracts
qualify as effective hedges under IAS 39. The changes in fair value of contracts that do not meet the definition of an IFRS effective hedge are
recognised in the income statement. Managing our principal risks and uncertainties is about locking down exposures to moving prices and
securing market level dark green and bark spreads for the future.

The Group designates certain hedging instruments used to address commodity price risk and foreign exchange risk as cash flow hedges. At the
inception of the hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item is documented, along with its risk management
objectives. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instruments used in
hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items. Changes in fair value of contracts designated into
such hedging relationships are recognised within the hedge reserve to the extent they are effective.

The Group’s cash flow hedges relate to commodity contracts (principally commitments to sell power) and forward foreign currency exchange
contracts. Amounts are recognised in the hedge reserve as the designated contracts are marked to market at each period end for the effective
portion of the hedge, which is generally 100% of the relevant contract. Amounts held within the hedge reserve are then released as the related
contract matures and the hedged transaction impacts profit or loss. For power sales contracts, this is when the underlying power is delivered.
For currency contracts, this is when the associated foreign currency transaction is recognised. Further information about the Group’s accounting
for financial instruments is included in note 7.2.

SECTION 7: RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED

**7.5 Contingent liabilities**
Contingent liabilities are potential future outflows of cash that are dependent on a future event that is outside of our control. The amount and
timing of any payment is uncertain, cannot be measured reliably, or is considered to be unlikely.

**Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP)**
The UK Government intends to implement legislation to equalise the GMP, resulting in an increase in the value of GMP for males. This would
correspondingly increase the defined benefit pension obligation of the Group (note 6.3). At present, the methodology for implementing the
equalisation is uncertain and thus the impact cannot be reliably measured. As a result, no allowance has been made for GMP equalisation in
the calculation of the defined benefit obligation within these consolidated financial statements.

**Borrowings**
In addition to the amount drawn down against the bank loans, certain members of the Group guarantee the obligations of a number of banks
in respect of letters of credit issued by those banks to counterparties of the Group. As at 31 December 2016 the Group’s contingent liability in
respect of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility amounted to £57.9 million (2015: £37.9 million).

**7.6 Commitments**
We have a number of financial commitments (i.e. a contractual requirement to make a cash payment in the future) that are not recorded in our
balance sheet as the contract is not yet due for delivery. Such commitments include contracts for the future purchase of coal and biomass,
operating leases for land and buildings, contracts for the construction of assets and contracts for the provision of services.

Commitments to purchase fuel reflect long-term forward purchase contracts with a variety of international suppliers, primarily for the delivery of
sustainable wood pellets for use in electricity production at Drax Power Station over the period from 2017–2027. To the extent these contracts
relate to the purchase of wood pellets, they are not reflected elsewhere in our financial statements owing to application of the “own-use”
exemption from fair value accounting to such contracts (see note 7.2).

SECTION 8:
# REFERENCE INFORMATION

This section details reference information relevant to the accounts. Here we describe the general information about the Group (e.g. operations and
registered office). We also set out the basis of preparation of the accounts and general accounting policies that are not specific to any one note.

**8.1 General information**
Drax Group plc (the Company) is incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act. The Company and its subsidiaries (together,
the Group) have three principal activities:

– Electricity generation; –

– Electricity supply to business customers; and–

– Manufacturing of sustainable compressed wood pellets for use in electricity production. –

The Group’s activities are principally based within the UK, with the wood pellet manufacturing activities situated in the US. The Group also
operates in the UK domestic heat market.

The address of the Company’s registered office and principal establishment is Drax Power Station, Selby, North Yorkshire, YO8 8PH, United
Kingdom. A full list of operating companies of the Group is disclosed in note 5 to the Company’s separate financial statements, which follow these
consolidated financial statements.

**8.2 Basis of preparation**
**Adoption of new and revised accounting standards**
A number of new and amended standards became effective for the first time in 2016. The Group adopted the following from 1 January 2016:

IAS 27 (amended) – Separate Financial Statements – applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016.

Annual improvements to 2012–2014 Cycle – all amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016.

IAS 16 (amended) – Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 38 (amended) Intangible Assets – applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on
or after 1 January 2016.

IAS 1 (amended) – Presentation of Financial Statements – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016.

IAS 19 (amended) – Defined Benefit Plans: Employee contributions – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 February 2015.

IFRS 11 (amended) – Joint Arrangements – applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016.

The adoption of these updates and amendments has not had a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.

At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following new or amended standards and relevant interpretations, which have
not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective (and some of which were pending endorsement by the EU –
marked by *):

IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.

IFRS 15 (including clarifications issued on 12 Aril 2016) – Revenue from Contracts with Customers – effective for annual reporting periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2018.

IFRS 16 (amended) – Leases – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.*

IFRS 10 (amended) – Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 (amended) Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (2011) – effective
date deferred indefinitely.*

IAS 12 (amended) – Income Taxes – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017.*

IAS 7 (amended) – Statement of Cash Flows – effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017.*

IFRIC 22 – Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.*

IAS 40 (amended) – Investment Property – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.

**165**


-----

SECTION 8: REFERENCE INFORMATION CONTINUED

Following endorsement by the EU, the Group expects to adopt IFRS 9 in line with the 1 January 2018 effective date. The adoption of this standard
is not expected to have a material impact on the recognition or measurement of the Group’s financial instruments. However, following adoption it
is anticipated that more of the Group’s forward purchase contracts will in future qualify for hedge accounting under the new standard than
under the existing standard. This will likely result in a greater proportion of unrealised gains and losses being recognised in the hedge reserve
and an associated reduction in income statement volatility.

The Group is in the process of completing a preliminary impact assessment for the adoption of IFRS 15, which is expected to be adopted in line
with the effective date of 1 January 2018. Whilst further work is required, the Group expects to review and update its revenue recognition policies
in light of the updated requirements. Based on the initial findings of this process, a material change to the quantum and timing of profitability is
considered unlikely at this stage.

The Group has not yet concluded its initial impact assessment into the adoption of IFRS 16; however at this stage the standard is not expected
to have a material impact on the recognition, measurement or presentation of amounts within the financial statements in respect of leases.
The Group currently expects to adopt IFRS 16 in the period it becomes mandatory, subject to EU endorsement.

Adoption of the other standards in future periods is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.

**8.3 Accounting policies**
The accounting policies set out below are considered to be general to the financial statements and not covered by a specific note.

**Foreign currency transactions**
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet
date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date.
Non‑monetary items are not retranslated.

Foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in the income statement within finance costs.

**Foreign operations**
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations with a functional currency other than sterling are translated into sterling using published exchange
rates at the reporting date. The income and expenditure of such operations are translated into sterling using the exchange rate prevailing at the
date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the retranslation of the operation’s net assets and its results for the
year are recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

**8.4 Related party transactions**
A related party is either an individual or entity with control or significant influence over the Group, or a company that is linked to us by investment
(such as an associated company or joint venture). Our primary related parties are our key management personnel.

**Remuneration of key management personnel**
The remuneration of the directors and Executive Committee members, who are considered to be the key management personnel of the Group, is
set out below in aggregate for each of the categories specified in IAS 24 “Related Party Disclosures”. Further information about the remuneration
of individual directors, together with the directors’ interests in the share capital of Drax Group plc, is provided in the audited part of the
Remuneration Committee report.

on pages 68 to 71, in addition to two former members of the Board and Executive Committee who resigned from the Board during 2016.

Amounts receivable under incentive schemes represents the expenses arising from share-based payments included in the income statement,
determined based on the fair value of the related awards at the date of grant (note 6.2), as adjusted for non-market related vesting conditions.

There were no other transactions with directors for the periods covered by these consolidated financial statements.
